This is so perfect when I tried it on. Love the fit.


Looks and fits great


Lovely dress that I plan to wear to my niece's wedding.  Should be quite comfortable all day.


It's prettier in person! It's a great weight fabric, and the dress is well made.  I will definitely order it in another color!


Flowers seem to upside down. Not sure if anyone else would notice


The fit is great and the material is comfortable. However, I got a rip from sitting down after just one wear, which was rather disappointing.


Great comfortable material, perfect flow, length of sleeves, pockets & overall good fit with the exception of the waist. It stretched to fit, however because the material was black the stretch created a "fade like" effect in the middle area. Would have kept otherwise.


Material was heavy polyester, super long.


Really a nice dress,  I'm 5'9" weight 210. It's a little short, but it really looks nice.
