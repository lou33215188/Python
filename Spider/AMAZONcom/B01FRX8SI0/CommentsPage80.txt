I quite like this dress and I've never received so many compliments from coworkers and random strangers in my life. It was also very comfortable. I needed to pin the dress a little at the chest partway through the day as it started to sag and show a little too much cleavage for work. It's comfortable and is the perfect length on me at 5'10" - it just skims the top of my toes in flat sandals. I am able to wear dark underwear and a bra because the pattern is busy enough to not make it particularly apparent.


Despite having read a number of reviews and the product details I totally missed this and was surprised when it arrived - the fabric is shiny. Like, bathing suit fabric. It's noticeable. It's my only complaint as I feel it cheapens the look of the dress. I wish it were in a heavy jersey fabric instead. So just be aware of this! I still think it's totally worth it!


This dress is great! I'm 5'5 usually an XL 12-14 sizes. The pockets are perfect for my phone. I agree that it doesn't really need the side zipper but other than that it's super comfy and pretty flattering.


Cute and comfortable! I got a medium - I am 5'4, 145 ish lbs and am short waisted and I wish the dress was little longer, but otherwise it's great!


Love that this dress has pockets! It was very flattering and super comfortable.
