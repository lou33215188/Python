So many compliments love it


So adorable and perfect for warm weather.


Wayyyyyy too long


Runs a little long but, love it and very comfortable...


Fits very nicely and comfortable.


Always get complimented on this! I'm 5'2 so I had to get it taken up quite a bit.


Ordered an XL and the top fit fine but the bottom half has too much material. It made me look like I had huge hips. Returned this item.


Even prettier in person. Fits as expected. Very happy with the purchase!


Very comfortable fit.


The fabric is so nice and the dress is beautiful! I love it!!
