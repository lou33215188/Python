Just got this yesterday and I LOVE it. This dress is going to be perfect for my baby shower. I'm 4 11" and 150 and order a larger. Fits perfect


This dress is so flattering it covered and flattened the tummy area and accentuates the girls perfectly. Wore this to a bridal shower and received a ton of compliments. Wish these came in solid colors as well!


OMG! Bought this during the lightning deal! The dress is so pretty and fit perfectly! I love it so much!


I have received so many compliments on this dress every time I wear it. It's fit well and it's extremely comfortable.


Beautiful dress and I love the pockets. My one complaint is that the fabric is a little thinner than I would like.


Very comfortable and flattering dress


Looks really nice and is super comfortable.  However the fabric is similar to that used for nightgowns, so just be aware.


I love these dresses (I bought 2) in 5'6 and they are short. Above my ankles. Wish they were longer, they look somewhat awkward


I ordered the floral-04 but received the floral-02ğŸ˜Œ  While I like the fit and the style it wasn't what I had ordered. I'll end up keeping it though evaude my event is tomorrow. Just wish I could have received what I ordered


Beautiful Dress!!!!! Very well made!!!
