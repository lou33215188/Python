I purchased this dress for my bridal shower, and the fit was amazing!  I love the pockets. I would definitely order in different colors.


Love it!


love it


Simple and pretty. I like the feel of the fabric. I ordered a small but I still not as snug as I'd like for how stretchy the material is.


A little tight right under the bust and a different fabric then I was expecting.  Overall happy with the dress.


Very good fit, very flattering. Great summer dress for going out at night.


Its really long.  I will have to hem it a bit.  I'm 5'6


I love this dress!  I'm 5' 7" and it reaches the floor.  I got an club because I am a 36G on top and it fits perfectly and I'm not pouring out of it!


Love this Dress!


I am average height and this dress drags the floor....love the dress will have it altered
