This dress was better than expected!!! It has the perfect flow and is made from an extremely comfortable material. The sizing is accurate and the colors are rich and bright.


I love the dress, fits little tight in the mid section. However, will be keeping. Love the flowy fabric which is quite soft. Does show a little cleavage, but nothing wearing a tank with it wouldn't fix. Love the print!


Also for reference I am 5'2 and normally wear a size 14 or XL and I purchased the XL dress.


Beautiful and incredibly comfortable. I'd absolutely buy another one like this.


So in love with this dress. The fabric is super soft and flowy and completely flattering, plus it has POCKETS!!!! I'm only 5'5" and it was not too long at all, ordered the XL.


Love it! I'm 145lbs and I got a small and it works great!


I am a dress size US14 and would normally wear an extra large. I've learned to order a size up from most of these retailers so I got an XXL and it fits perfectly.


It's a lovely print and it drapes beautifully. I had a baby 3 months ago and I'm working on getting my body back. This dress falls just right to disguise all the lumps and bumps. ;)


I ordered the black floral print dress. I normally wear a size 8, so ordered the dress in medium.  It came in a nice quality material, heavy but breathable fabric, and didn't show any wrinkles even out of the box.  The color is a nice deep black with grey flowers.  The medium fit quite well, but was a little bit too low cut for my taste.  Since it is a stretchy material and elastic waist, I decided to order the same dress in a small to see if that would fit better (and then planning to return the one I didn't like).  When the second dress came in a small, it was a completely different material!  Same pattern, but instead of black, it was a very unattractive dark purplish grey color, with a bit of shine, and the material was very thin and wrinkled badly.  I was so surprised at the difference in quality!!!


I had been wondering why the reviews on this product were so conflicting, some saying it was great quality and other saying the material was very poor quality.  Now I understand why!


Needless to say, I returned the second one, kept the good quality medium dress, and used a safety pin to make the neckline a bit more modest.  One of the best things about it is that it has pockets, and with the flowy style of the dress, even with a large cell phone in the pocket it shows very little bulge.


I want to start by saying I am so critical of dresses. I have a hard time finding a good dress. That being said this is a beautiful dress. I am 5'7" approx 170lbs and I ordered an X LG. It was the perfect length and super flattering. It wasn't tight and hid all the things you wouldn't want to see in photos. There was no awkward muffin top. I felt pretty wearing this dress. The sleeves are a perfect length to flatter the arms. None of those stupid capsleeves that show your armpit fat lol! These are real sleeves. ğŸ˜‚ The material has a slight sheen to it so you could even wear it to a fancier occasion like a guest to a wedding. Just buy the dress. Good dresses are hard to come by these days!


The dress fits well and looks great. It is comfortable and is thick enough to not need a slip under it. I am 5'5'' and 200lbs and bought the xxl, I love it but the length just brushes the ground while wearing flats, heels would fix that. Also, I wish the side zipper had material to cover it when it was zipped, because it rubs on my underarms.


Love this dress! You may want to wear it with a cami underneath depending on how much of the girls you wanna show! The best part is it has pockets!


I'm 5'6 and the length is perfect with sandals, or short wedges. I'm a 14/16 typically with a 38D cup and the XL fit very well. I could maybe go down to the L because it's pretty stretchy, but the XL is really comfortable.
