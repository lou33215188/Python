Absolutely love this dress, read a bunch of reviews and decided to get the black w/ flowers in a 2xl. The material is so soft and I love the pockets and it's true to size. It took 3 days to ship and I was not disappointed at all! I highly recommend getting this if you at don't be fence.


It's a nice dress though way too long for me so as yet I haven't been able to wear it


I absolutely LOVE this dress! It fits as expected but is a little short, it doesn't reach all the way to the floor but it didn't bother me that much. I'll definitely be buying from this shop again!


Not the colors I was expected and too short


This dress is so pretty! I wear it all the time, it is flattering, comfy, and looks great. I'm 5'9" and it comes about to my ankles.


Seriously surprised at how much I loved this dress. The fabric is slick and stretchy but it's SO COMFORTABLE. I put it on as soon as I got it just to see if it fit and ended up wearing it around the house for a few hours because I didn't want to take it off!


I purchased for my daughters baby shower. I received so many compliments on how pretty this dress was. Love it.


I got two of these, scared it wouldn't fit. These are beautiful! They fit perfectly. And they even have pockets! They're fresh and light. Best for traveling. The material has some stretch to it. It's light but not see thru-ish. Good quality.


The dress looks beautiful and enhances my hourglass shape while minimizing the flab on my arms.


I'm 5'3 and 150 pounds. The dress fit perfectly. It brushes the top of my feet and hides my belly. The quality is great and the cut is flattering for any figure!
