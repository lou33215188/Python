Extremely comfortable and very flattering.  As others have said, the neckline is open so you may need to safety pin it.  Has pockets which is amazing.


I'm waiting to see how the fabric holds up to washing and wear - it seems like it might pill after a couple of washes.  If it doesn't, I'm definitely ordering more!


I got this for a postpartum dress and it worked well. Easy to breastfeed in too. I'm 5'11" and this was really short on me though, so I was a little disappointed in it. Just used it as a nice house dress


The picture does it no justice. Was so pretty I ordered all the colors. Fits well. I'm 5' 8" size 16 and ordered XXL. FITS WELL.


Beautiful dress! I am 5'4" and it's just a tad long- perfect length with shoes.


A very cute dress! A little tight in the chest and shoulders for me; also a little long. The colors and pattern are very vibrant.


I'm 5'7", 145 lbs, and a definite pear shape. I ordered a medium. It was too big at the bust and waist for me. I should have ordered a small. However, the medium fell to my ankles, which is way too short for me. I won't be exchanging this product for a smaller size because it is too short. Also know, when the fabric is stretched out, it is very see through.


LOVE IT....comfy, beautiful and it has pockets...wahooooo


Light and airy which makes it perfect for summer.


This is just a gorgeous dress!!!! I love that it has a side zipper which makes it even more easy to put on. The sizing was just right, and the fabric is really nice and flowey! I am so happy!


It fit as expected with one tiny exception. The bust area: so, as usual, the cross over piece needs to be tacked down because the dress wants to be low cut. Also, the fabric is straight up poly-nylon, which I don't know why I didn't understand. This dress looks really good on, though! Very flattering. It's a better dress for someone 5'8" or taller, I believe.
