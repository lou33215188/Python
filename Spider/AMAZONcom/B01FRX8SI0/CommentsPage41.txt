Fit was not good at all and the material is shiny which I was not expecting. Will be returning.


Love this dress!! Fits like a dream! 5'5" - 196 lbs ordered xxl and fit perfectly, just skims the floor barefoot.


Nice dress I purchased for family pictures with a group of 12, this one didn't make the cut but it was very nice.


Really cute but the sizing is so weird! I ordered 2 different sizes and they were both huge. Didn't even risk it a 3rd time...


This dress looks so amazing on.  So much better than the pictures.  Fits like a dream,


This item smelled terrible out the bag like a burnt plastic. I have washed it 4 times and I can not get the smell out. It’s bad like made me gag. It’s a cute dress but I can’t get the smell out so I will be trashing it. I can’t get a hold of the seller and I have already taken the tags off and washed so I washed my money. So sad.


Great fit and nice look.  Love the pockets. The bodice exposes a little more than I'd like so I plan to place a couple of stitches in strategic places to correct that.


Very cute and comfortable. I would give five starts but kinda big on me I'm 5"4 155 and it was a little baggy on me.


A nice dress. And the small price is nice too.


Absolutely love the fit & comfort of this dress.  I bought only one but am going back & ordering the other colors.
