I just recieved mine, beautiful except left pocket is almost sewed shut:(


I am absolutely in love with this dress!!! It is beautiful and super flattering!


You get what you pay for.  This print is lovely.  The fabric seems really cheap.


Overall great for what I paidâ€¦ Fabric is a little cheap.  The dress fits well, but is shorter than most Maxis. I am pretty short so it fits me perfectly


Fits great! If anything, I would say it runs a bit large. The material is very breathable and "stretchy." I love it!


Do not like the way it fit....was extra long and made me look wider.


I Love it!


Fits perfect


Beautiful dress.


Love this dress!


I've never had a prettier better fitting dress!!! I have gotten so many compliments on this dress every time I wear it and it's my mans favorite!!!!
