Love it!


Thin material,  very low cut.


Loved it! I wore it for a work conference and got endless compliments. I'm curvy (on top and bottom), and this dress was so flattering. It was super easy to wear and traveled great. I plan to wear it again to a wedding in a few weeks!


Dressy, pretty, comfortable, stretchy, good for nursing, and it has pockets!


Love this dress! For reference, I am 5'5", 190 lbs and cup size 38B. Size large fit well. My only "complaint" (very minor) is that it is a liiiiittle short on me (hits at the ankles), but definitely not a deal breaker. Can be worn dressed down or dressed up. May order another one!


Beautiful dress, great fit.


Not sure why there is a side zipper since the dress is nice and stretchy.... but other than that, its really quite nice.  XL fits me perfectly, I'm 5'3", 190 LBS, and 38DD.


Love this dress so much. It fit me perfectly. Its well made and good material. Very flattering and perfect if you happen to be a nursing mom. Definitely going to buy more of different prints.


Very nice quality dress. Fits great. I'm 5'7 155lbs and it fits just right I purchased a medium. Very happy with this dress for our family pics this weekend.


Seriously beautiful dress.  I feel like a princess and I look like one too.  Best thing,  it has pockets.  The neckline isn't too revealing and I have a 42ddd. Cup size.
