Not only is this dress beautiful but the fit is spot on! The material is flown & light weight but not see through.


Very Happy with the dress. Fit and feel is really nice. Love love the deep pockets. Have received so many compliments.


Was a little short but not so much I would return. You can see my whole foot up to my ankles. I'm 5 foot 6 inches, got an XL. Other than the length it was definitely a good buy for the price!


Got it as part of Prime Day-- I love the print, but the dress is a bit big and the material reminds me of a bathing suit. I got compliments on it though!


I love this dress. After reading the comments, I ordered a size up.... wish I hadn't going to return and order the correct size!


Love will buy other colors


It's a beautiful dress and looks as shown in the picture. I am glad I purchased this! :)


good quality fabric, nice fit. Dress pulls in nicely at the waist and  the neckline is V cut, but high enough to wear to work.


This dress is super cute!! I did buy a size up because I'm ALWAYS nervous online clothes will be too small. I am an size 20/22 and I bought the  3x. It fits great but I could probably get away with a 2x as well. It is very good quality material, the fabric lays so nicely and I love the pockets. I would buy this dress again in a heartbeat.


Love it. I usually wear a size 6 in dresses and a size 8 in bridal. I got the small and it was perfect. The pockets are nice. It is very soft and flowys. Got a lot of compliments.
