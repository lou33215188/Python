the material is cheap and shiny....


This dress is an wesome fit! Going to be my go to teaching dress. The fabric is a different texture than I was expecting. Not a bad feeling  it a bit like a swim suit.


So pretty, but the fabric is pretty heavy.


Great color but did not like how it made my body look.


Fits like a dream! Makes me feel all put together. I wore this a week after a c section to a bridal shower and got tons of compliments.


Received quickly. Very omfortable. Fit was a little small but I love the dress.


Lord help us all when Trump stops trading with China, because no one else will get to own this dress, and i wish everyone could. It's insane how well it fits and makes my body look. I'm 5'2 and my measurements are 30g-26-38. I ordered a small and it fits almost as good as my own skin. It's a tad long on me for just flats or flip flops but works perfectly with wedges or platforms. Overall one of the best fitting dresses I've ever had the pleasure to own.


Fits nice, great pockets.


The dress fit well and the sizing is accurate. The dress was pretty with the black and pink flower pattern. It just turned out that I didn't like the way it looked with my body type.


The print is pretty but the mid waist band is to large for the dress and just looked odd...
