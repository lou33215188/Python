Beautiful dress I get so many compliments. Everyone says it is so beautiful.


Love this dress, it fits well and flatters my mom-bod. My only complaint is that a seam wasn’t sewn right in the waist and left a 5” hole, before I had even worn it. Luckily I’m handy and sewed it up good as new.


Nice style but material was not to my liking. I returned it.


Very nice dress for the price.  Not to long and like the sleeve.


I don't know if it's because I'm 6ft but this looked like a cheap maternity dress on me. So disappointing.


Beautiful dress. Every time I wear it I get compliments. I'm 5'2", if I was any shorter I would need to get it altered. Runs a little large. I'm a curvy 10/12 and I ordered a large. I probably could have gotten a medium.


Absolutely love this dress!  Can't wait to wear it for a very special occasion!!


Beautiful thick fabric. Fits perfectly, and who doesn't love pockets?  I'm ordering another in a different print because I love the first.  I'm a size 12.  5'9". In ordered Xl


Lived this dress.  So comfy and beautiful.


Pretty dress.  The pattern was not too busy and was flattering
