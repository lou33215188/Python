Pretty and very comfortable!


It may be my own fault because I'm a little in between sizes but the medium is a little big on me. But the cut and colors are awesome. I got compliments all day long. Plus, POCKETS! Not too long so I was able to wear comfortably with flats. Neckline was not too low but did gap a bit. Fabric is stretchy and cool enough to survive a central Florida summer but doesn't seem like it will lose its shape. I am 5'6", 150 lbs, 34C/D and float between a 6 and 8 for size references.


Did not like the fabric...returning it


I am 5'7 and 165 pounds and top heavy. The dress comes above my ankles and it looks like I'm a religious person trying to cover up with the most unflattering dress. It has no shape.


I love this dress- it is comfortable and looks great. The fabric is very thin, but if it fits and is not stretched, you cannot tell.


Little big in the waist but great dress. I get so many compliments on it every time I wear it. A bit open in the vneck for a large chested girl but nothing a quick cami can't fix.


Dress seems to be good quality, nice, comfy, stretchy material. I'm 5'8 and the dress hits right at or a little above the ankle, i was hoping it would go to the floor but ill just have to wear it with flats.


Perfection! Tons of complements and true to size


good quality and fits like expected. super pleased with it


Liked dress a lot but came with a big fabric flaw on the top of the dress.  It was returned.
