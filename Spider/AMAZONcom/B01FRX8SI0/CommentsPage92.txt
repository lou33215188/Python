Perfect and super comfy! Husband liked the dress on me very much!


Very nice fit, a little long even for my height of 5'7".


Love the dress. Bought a medium and it fits a little bigger than I expected. I'm 5'2 and a bit on the curvier side.


Material. Was ok. But to long and big for a m size.


Great dress, had to have it shortened to a tea length, I'm vertically challenged! Washed beautifully, and it's a favorite!


Very nice style and drape.  Fabric ls a bit thin.
