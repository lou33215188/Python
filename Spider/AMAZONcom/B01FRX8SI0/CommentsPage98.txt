So cute and comfortable. perfect summer dress.


I love it! I was not sure of which size to get, but I ended up getting the 3x. It could be a little tighter but it is not like a tent on me. I weigh 260, I am 5'5, and I wear a size 20 pants. I may end up ordering another, it is a very comfortable and beautiful dress. The price is also amazing! It is very long it hits the floor, but that is one of the things that I like.


have to get someone to him it but it is beautiful


Wore it it a wedding and got tons of compliments

I love this dress!  I am 5'2" and 115 pounds. The small fits perfectly. It's definitely floor length since I'm short, but it's perfect with heels. I was worries that it might be a bit open in the front, but it's closed enough that I didn't have to wear a shirt underneath to make it work appropriate. I've already gotten a ton of compliments, and most importantly it's super comfortable.  I'm planning to live in this dress this summer since it's casual enough for the weekend but dressy enough for work.  The pockets are a great bonus.  I will be looking to see if there are other patterns I like, and ordering them too.


Very comfortable dress, worn to a graduation and was perfect.
