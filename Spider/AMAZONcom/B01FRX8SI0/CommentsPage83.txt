Cute dress, but I'm not sure how much I like it on me.


This dress is perfect! And those pockets :) who doesn't want a perfect dress with pockets?!?! Highly recommend.


I am 5 foot 3 inches and this is the perfect length on me! I was surprised that I didn't have to hem this at all!


While it fit just fine, the material was really shiny and it just looked cheap to me. Returned it.


This dress is fantastic - it fits great and is so comfortable! Even though it's mostly white, it's not really see-through.


The dress was pretty short and the fabric is not my favorite. It's kind of shiny and that wasn't what I was expecting.


I am post baby.  5'6 145 pounds.  Small fit great but was to short!  Returning.  Beautiful dress if was longer!


Did not know what to expect but was wowed by the outcome. Dress fit perfectly, and material will ever need to be ironed. Would buy another!


Great dress and super comfortable.  Love the pockets!


Fits big


Low cut


And clinging to the extra fat on the back
