Great dress, but too short for this 5’9” gal. All other facets are right on: vneck, pockets, pattern, but it’s too short in length :(


Bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  Didn't realize it had a side zipper so she was concerned about it slipping over her chest but it worked out.  She looks awesome in it and is happy with the length, she's 5'7" and the overall look.


Ordered this for Mother's Day and it fit great.  I got a lot of compliments on it.


I ended up returning this product. It is true to color but the dress just wasn't flattering on my body. The material seemed heavy and I just couldn't convince myself to like it enough to keep it.


Draped, did not fit my wife. Better off fitting rather than buying online. Nice pattern!


I love the print on this dress! It's a little hot, and that's the only complaint I have about the dress at all. I've gotten a dozen compliments on the dress and I've only worn it once!


When the dress arrived I did not like the overall look of the dress and sent it back.


I ordered a medium and the dress fit great except for the chest area...somewhat too big. The length was perfect, just had no idea it was way more of a beach dress material not wedding attire.


I'm 5'7" at 140 lbs. The print was very cute but the fabric was shiny. I had not anticipated a shiny look. The bottom was too big so it made me look frumpy.


Shorter than expected. I'm 5"4 and it hit a little above my ankles which is not what I wanted. The pocket placement also added to a bulky feel at the hip making it bulge out. Material is not cotton it's more of a slick material that is see through when stretched. Pattern and colors are as shown in pictures. Would of potentially kept if it was longer.
