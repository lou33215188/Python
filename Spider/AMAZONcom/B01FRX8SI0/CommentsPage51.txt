Cute design, but very short. I am 5' 7" and it was well above my ankle. Material is ok - not my favorite.


Size ran small.


Beautiful design, pleanty of room for my belly to grow, lightweight, and very soft/comfortable fabric. Overall I am very pleased with this dress!


LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!


feels soft and look beautiful


It's cute and comfortable. I always receive compliments when I wear it. Pockets weren't the same size on both sides though


This dress is gorgeous and comfortable. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. I'm usually a medium/large (I'm 5'4" and 175lbs) but a medium is a perfect fit. PLUS it has pockets!!!


The zipper did come off the first time I put it on but it was an easy fix, just don't zip it all the way down.


It’s pretty but had to hem. I’m only 5’3, but most dresses aren’t this long on me.


Great fit! Material is different than expected but overall good quality product


Flattering fit, a little on the ahort side though. I'm 5'5", ordered an XL and it barely sweeps the tops of my feet which is fine for me because I prefer flats but kind of disappointing that I can't wear it with heels ever.
