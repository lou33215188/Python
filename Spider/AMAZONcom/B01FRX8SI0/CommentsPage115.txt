The top portion was too snug while also showing a lot of cleavage. The fabric was wonderful, wish they had plus sizes to compensate for the top.


Fits perfect and I love how the material feels on my body . I can't waif to get more different colors .


Very comfortable and love the pockets.


This dress fell apart after 2 months of use. It is literally unusable now. Would not buy again.


This dress is beautiful! True to size. Nice material.


The dress is very comfortable and flattering. Wasnt horrible long on me since I'm short.


Love the fit and the color. My favorite part is the pockets! I don't know a woman that doesn't love hidden pockets in a dress


I love the material it was so conffy but still really nice ,i got alot of complements with me wearing  this dress i loved it !!!


Nice and stretchy... fit perfect! Im 5'2, 137lbs and it was just right.. didnt drag too much :)


It's beautiful, but the top doesn't fit as well as expected.
