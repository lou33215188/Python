This is a great dress... I have several of the OUGES maxi dresses and love all of them. Always get compliments and feel great when I wear them! :)


I do wear this often.  It is comfortable.


Love this dress, the style, material and fit. Had to order another one of a different print!


Great nursing friendly dress!  The fabric texture isn't my favorite, but I love the print and pockets.  It is comfortable and I really could wear it all of the time.


I am 5'5" and bought a medium, apricot color. The dress was too short. It ended at a very unflattering ankle length. If it were longer and reached closer to the floor it would have been perfect. I was about 1 month post partum, 155lb. Would have been great for breastfeeding, covering up my belly.


I'm 5ft6, 145lbs and this dress (sz m) was too large around my mid section & bust, & not quite long enough to be floor length. The stitching around the bust also seemed a little wonky, but it does have pockets!


Looks great and the gf loves it.


I was a little skeptical about ordering but this dress is amazing! I ordered the white, black and gray one and its beautiful in person! There is a zipper on the side so you can slide it over your head. I am 5'2, 200 lbs and the xxl fits very well! This dress doesn't drag the ground at all it sits right on the top of my feet! I will order another!


I was going to wear it to a regular, evening semi-casual event all summer, but it's a little dressier than I expected, so I'm saving it for a wedding I'm attending in August. I didn't think I'd be able to get by with such an inexpensive dress but no one will ever guess it.


This dress is one of my favorites. I ordered a large, I am 5’3”, 160lbs and 36DD. The dress fits perfectly and I love the side zipper. I do however wish that the length was longer. I unfortunately can only wear flat shoes with it or else it looks too short and weird.
