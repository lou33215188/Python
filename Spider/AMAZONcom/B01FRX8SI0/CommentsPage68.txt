Somewhat Iarge, I should have gotten large instead of XL.


But I love it. It fits alright. I plan to take it in half an inch. I am 5'4" and weigh 160 lb


Love this dress!! So comfy, has pockets (always a plus!) and I got many compliments wearing it. I did size up, I'm typically an XL or 2xl and got the 3x to be on the safe side from other reviews.


I'm petite (5'3" on a good day), and this was way too short for me. Unfortunately I missed the return date so now I'm stuck with it :(


Nice light fabric. Very soft and comfortable. I'm 5'3" and usually long dresses are too long for me but this dress's length was perfect. I can't wait to wear it to my daughter's baby shower!


I bought this dress and it fit perfect so I bought another one and the new one doesnâ€™t fit at all. The waist band is much tighter on the second one and I am returning it.


great dress! im a size 18 and ordered the XXL and have extra room in waist and arms. just enough to be comfortable. im 5'8 and it hits the top of my foot. definitely long enough. im very happy with this! i will be purchasing more colors!


Wonderful! Fit perfectly to advertised measurements. Very comfortable. Pockets make everything better - held my phone without creating bulk or showing in the dress!


Always hesitant after reading all of the reviews, but the dress came and the material feels amazing and fits perfectly! Length is also perfect. I'm 5'4 and it falls maybe an inch above the ground if I'm not wearing heals. Would definitely recommend!


I had previously ordered this in a medium and it was way too large and long.  This fits me perfectly!


for the price it is a throw on dress but nothing very special
