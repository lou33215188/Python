Pretty material and print but it runs so small.  Descriptions said it was for a tall person, but I'm 5'8" and it hit me mid calf.


I have this dress in the navy floral and LOVE it, but then I bought it again, in a different color, same size and it's about 6 sizes too large.


This dress is so nice. I wear size 18/20 and it fit my body perfectly.


I am in love with this dress , I plannto buy other colors too


Gorgeous print, fabric, design and fit.  This might be the perfect dress!


I LOVE this dress! It fits great! I love the belted area around the waist, the neckline is perfect for me I don't feel too exposed. I was worried about the length, I'm 5'6" and sometimes maxi dresses are ankle length on me but this one is perfect. I will definitely buy another one!


So many compliments on this dress. Is so cute and comfortable. I love the pockets too!


Beautiful dress but the style just didn't flatter me. The size was exactly as expected.


Its a pretty dress.  It doesn't flatter my figure type (short waist & apply).


It's too long in the bodice and  flares in the waist too much on me.


I would give it five stars if the fabric wasn't SO THIN. You can see through it. Wear a slip
