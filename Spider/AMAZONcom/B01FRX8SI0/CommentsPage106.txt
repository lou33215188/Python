I have been lusting after this dress for MONTHS, and after reading so many reviews, I finally pulled the plug and ordered it. I am SO disappointed with this. I'm only 5'2 and the dress falls 2-3 inches off the ground, barefoot. So in shoes, it's more like 3 inches off the ground. The top is super loose in the shoulders, but if I sized down it would be too small in the waist. Based off the size chart and reviews, I ordered an XL in order to fit my 36DD's, and I have a 34 inch waist . The color appears a lot darker on my screen than it is in person - it's silvery in person. I feel like maybe I got a factory defect? This is just not the dress so beloved in the reviews by so many others and I'm so sad to have to return it.


Very very beautiful dress. Got lots of compliments. Fitted just perfect.


Very pleased, fits well and I have gotten many complements when I wear it.


Great dress. Only issues is the material is very thin & see through.


Really pretty dress and very comfortable but just too short. I'm 6'0 and weigh about 165. I ordered a medium and everything fit but it came up about mid calf on me. Really disappointed that I have to return it.


Was able to get it over my shoulders without unzipping it.


My cousin loves it

Very pretty and good value for the money.  I like that it has short sleeves, but it's cut very narrow in the rib area.
