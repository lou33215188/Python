Love the pattern, but I'm 5'10 and it was too short for me when I ordered a large. Stretchy fabric and has POCKETS. Perfect for a summer wedding.


Love this dress. I wear it all the time. It's great for weekend days when I don't want to have to think too hard, but still want to look nice.


Very flattering dress! Has pockets!


Love the dress. Was a little shorter than I hoped (I'm 5'7") and large in the bust for me but those weren't deal breakers. The material is soft and comfortable. Will order again!!


This is so much cuter than I thought it would be! However, taller girls may not like the length. I am 5'2 and this hit just above my feet. I was very happy since I normally have to have everything tailored to fit properly.


so many compliments on this dress. I normally wear a M, returned it for this Small & it fits perfect. Fabric is flowy, comfortable, & perfect length for us short girls!


Well made.  I ordered a small, which is usually my size.....it works. It's just a little big. I'll probably take it in


This dress is really beautiful and very comfortable.  I really like how it fits.  The material is very soft too


I was sceptical of this dress because it is hard for me to find things that fit me, especially online. I'm 5'6, 310 pounds and 31 weeks pregnant. I got this dress in a size 3X to wear to my baby shower and it fits perfectly!


This dress is really pretty. I love the pockets and it's very comfortable. Also a nice length that can easily be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion. Great value for money!
