Runs slightly large but still well enough to wear ok.


This dress fits to size and is comfortable. I wore a camisole underneath since the front is a little revealing for me. The length was longer than my height, so plan on hemming it up. I got compliments on it when I wore it.


I was worried about this dress not fitting since i am larger and a lot of these dress measurements are not in US sizing.  I got the dress and was in love i could have gone down one size but the fit was great and the pockets are awesome and deep enough for a phone and sunglasses.  Wish i had more reasons to wear it, it was so comfortable.


I love this! Fits my large chest without showing too much. And it has pockets! I ordered a size up and it fits perfectly.  Zipper on the side seems kind of flimsy so I'll have to be careful. Overall,  I would def recommend.


A beautiful dress fit was perfect fabric felt like heaven, wore to a wedding w black boots and black leggings w/ similar flowers around the ankles and black jacket.  It made me feel very comfortable and enjoyed wearing it so much.  I am a larger woman and think this is one of those styles that will work with almost any size.  Highly recommended!!


I got a ton of compliments on it.  My only complaint is the back had some discoloration in the fabric.  The print is busy enough to hide it.  But someone picky would be upset about it. But over all it was cute.  If u are short be prepared to be in high shoes or get it hemmed


Love this dress! I'm short (5'2.5") and did not need to hem it at all. I am normally a M/L but sized down to a small for this dress. I have it in two colors now.


I am size 14 so I ordered a xl. Should have gotten a large. I love the dress although so I will be ordering another in the correct size. Material is heavenly


Very cute and comfy. Would look great as a maternity dress. Will be reordering other patterns.


I gave this to my daughter for her birthday, she loves it !
