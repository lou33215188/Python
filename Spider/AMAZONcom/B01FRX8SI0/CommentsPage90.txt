Perfect, comfortable fit for a wedding attended 2 weeks postpartum. It even allowed easy access for nursing.


I am a middle school teacher and my students gave me many compliments


.


Beautiful


I didn't like this enough on myself to keep it.


Beautiful, but runs a little short, I am 5'7 and it floods a little on me.


Dis dress is lovely the material is soft and not see tru but u can wear a slip if you wish. It fits tru to size I usually wear a large and the large in this dress fits perfect.


It is a great dress. Love everything about it and it fit me perfectly.


Super cute and flattering. And very comfy!


Flow and comfortable. Dress it up or down.


Materials and crafting lovely but not an appropriate fit for my body style!
