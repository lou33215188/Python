too large for me..didnt fit right returned


It's cute...I just don't like the fabric. It feels/looks like an old lady's house dress.


Gorgeous print, very soft silky fabric, with perfect stretch. Zipper hidden along one side for easy get-on. Love it!


This dress was really nice; could be advertised as a maternity dress. I'm an 18 usually nut just had my second child so I need a little more wiggle room. I ordered a 2x - it's a bit big but still okay. Before my second child I probably would have ordered a 1X. This fits nicely on my bust; below the waist band, the dress comes out a bit which sometimes gives the appearance of maternity. That may be my body tho. Overall good for the price.


So comfy!!!! I am pregnant and everyone lived it!!


It's actually a lot cuter than I thought it might be. Maybe is a bit bigger than expected. Really pretty dress


Really pretty pattern ---- cut well -- flowy and comfy with pockets!


Can wear with flip flops or heels


Love it !


Love it. Great travel dress. Machine wash and dry with no ironing.


nice print~unusual color. ruching at stomach wasn't flattering for me though.


AMAZING dress ! I received so many compliments while wearing it!
