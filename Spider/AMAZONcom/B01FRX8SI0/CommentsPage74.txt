Fits well and comfortable


Ran short on my 5'4" frame despite reading company answers that it runs long. A good bit of ankle space showing. The xxl worked well for my size 16-18 38dd shape.


I love this dress, great for nursing too. I'm 5'6", usually size 16 and the XL was perfect. I wore this to my daughter's baptism a week after I had her and it's very flattering in all the right places.  The length is a tiny bit long so I gave it a 4 sinse looks much shorter in the picture.
