Very nice dress.  Thank you.


Love it!


Slightly too small at midriff.


I wrote a previous review pretty much hating this dress and they way it fit. However, I was contacted by the manufacturer and in a very nice memo to me they mentioned did I know about the zipper? Duh, I did not and of course, now it fits much better. I am thoroughly embarrassed at my own lack of knowledge of this product and would like to change my review to this. It has very nice material and of course fits better when I unzip it first. My apologies to Ouges


A little too big and not what I expected. From the picture I thought it was black and white only.


tight in the bust area but roomy everywhere else


Fabric too light.


Love this dress ! And it has pockets‚ù§


nice


It's pretty and I wish it fit.
