I love this dress! Very flattering and slimming. I ordered another I love it so much.


I love this dress. It is so beautiful. Now I just need a nice place to wear it besides around the farm.


I love this dress! This dress requires no effort at all to look cute. I love that it has pockets and is very flowy. I am 5'3.5 and I wear this dress with my sandals and it doesn't drag on the floor. The only thing I don't like, this dress is the material it is not very breathable.


It's nice, but it makes me look very pregnant.  It's comfortable and would actually make a great maternity dress.


I got this dress and cutit's cute.  The pockets make my hips look huge.  Of you have bobs you will need a camisole underneath or safety pin.


This dress fit really well. Im 4’11”, 160 and hour glass shaped. I ordered a medium and it was very flattering.


I love the fit, material and the pockets on this maxi dress.  So comfortable.


It was a cute dress but I didn't like how I looked in it. I had to return it.


This dress fits beautifully and is so flattering! I normally wear an 18-20 and ordered the XXL. The fabric is soft and the pattern is gorgeous!


Absolutely love this dress!  The length is perfect, it's super comfortable, lightweight material and so soft.  Very easy to wear and the pockets are super cute!  I am bigger busted and sometimes find it hard to fit into stuff but it fits perfectly!  I bought this in 2 other colors...got lots of compliments!  Love it!
