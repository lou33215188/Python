I know this dress has great reviews but it doesn't fit right in the chest area and is super shiny cheap . Cute in pics and from really far away . I wouldn't purchase again


Amazing dress!  Love the pockets. The zipper on the side really pulls it together.  Nursing, postpartum body friendly! Will be buying another color.


Love this! I get so many compliments every time I wear it.


I'm 5'0 and 130lbs. I got a small and fit great. Probably could've got an XS if it was available


Loved it. A little big so buy a size smaller.


Beautiful maxi dress. It fit just as I expected. The colors are very pretty.


Love the way it accents my pregnant belly without being revealing or clinging to tightly to areas I don’t want to show. I just didn’t like how long it was but I’m only 5”3 so maxi dresses being to long is a common issue for me!


Poorly fitting.  Small and tight fitting fabric.


Beautiful dress. Comfortable and classy


Cute dress just not for me.
