I received this dress with a broken zipper, I don't recommend this.


Excellent!  Really surprised at how well this fit and flowed. I'm 5'5" and it's the perfect length just skimming the ground. I ordered the xxl and could have ordered the XL but I like the extra room. Little low cut but nothing obscene. Will pin just to avoid any movement not out of necessity.


Beautiful dress --love it


It has pockets!!!  Love it. So comfortable and stretchy!  I'm 5'10 and it's such a lovely dress and print! Wish I would've bought 2-3 since it was a prime day item.


I loved this dress! Super comfortable, I was able to easily breastfeed and got tons of compliments! First time I felt good since I had my son. I am 5'4 and 190lbs and I ordered an XL. I could have probably gone down to a large.


I love it.  Beautiful and very comfortable!


Love the way this dress feels, hangs and drapes.  Pattern is lovely and the bonus is it has pockets!


The wrong size I'm 5'3 157 pounds I ordered a XL and need a L it's too big in the ribcage. I will be exchanging it because it's a cute dress and I definitely want it to fit just right. The pockets are an added bonus !!


Very nice for the money


I really like this dress but I'm 5'8" and it hits me above my ankles. Just wish maxi dresses were actually long. It's much easier to hem something then to make it longer.
