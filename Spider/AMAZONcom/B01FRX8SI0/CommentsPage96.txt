Fits nicely.


While it runs a little big, it's very comfortable and the perfect length.


There were multiple reviews saying this dress is for "tall girls". Well, I am a tall girl and this dress is not for me. I am 5'11" 165 lbs and the dress barely went past my mid calf. Other than the length, it's a great dress. The fabric was nice and stretchy, but there is no way I can wear it. I rated it as "Fit as expected" because I ordered an XL and the top fit just fine.  I am disappointed. I was very much looking forward to receiving the dress, but I'll be returning it.


From Roger's Wife: I am very pleased with this dress.  I took my measurements and bought the size that corresponded with the size chart. It fits perfectly.  I am 5'7" and the dress is long enough to be worn with flats or low heals. The neckline is lower than I like so I will have to wear a cami to take the neckline up to a more comfortable height. The dress is made of 94% polyester and 6% spandex so it is easy care. It appears to be very well made.  Although the material stretches, the waist does not stretch much because of the stitching so I would recommend you order based on your waist size.  It is a very comfortable dress and it will get a great deal of use this summer.


Dress fitted as expected for the brand. I do recommend that you go up one size.
