Beautiful dress but very low in the front -- you need something under the dress or you will hang out !


Too long, too deep of a plunge. It's also made of polyester, the most heat trapping fabric ever made


great summer dress


If I had seen this in person first, would not have bought.  Cheap looking thin material.


This is my favorite dress. It's comfy and beautiful and has pockets! I safety pin the chest closed a little bit, but I have no complaints.


Beautiful very well-made


Beautiful colors, nice fit and affordable. I'm 5'1" and the length was perfect for me.  I plan to order at least one more.


Love this dress. Great material. Fit is good. Love the pockets.


This dress fits a little big but it's so comfortable and easy to wear. And I love the pockets!
