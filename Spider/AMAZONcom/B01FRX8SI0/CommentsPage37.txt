I love this dress!  Fits beautifully, and very flattering!  I ordered 3X, and fit is always iffy for me, so this was a really pleasant surprise.  I will get lots of wear out of this.  Super comfortable, and I love the pockets!  I would order more of these if there were more fabric choices.


Shows the boobs. Need an undershirt. XL fit great 5"8 170lb hid the rolls and was cozy and pockets! The arms were not constricted. I'd buy again


Cute, but larger than expected, gave away


I ordered an XL and it flattering on my curves. I typically wear a Size 16 and am 5'8. The dress falls right above my ankles. The dress is made out of quality material. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the neck line, but an undershirt will fix that!


The zipper on the side is a little hard to zip because of the bunched fabric that is next to it. Other then that its great. With the zipper you just have to be careful and go slowly!


Thick material, but it has a sort of satin sheen that makes it look really dated.


The fit was fantastic except I had trouble with the waist area (below the breasts) was tough to get over my breasts (I am nursing and my breasts are HUGE) but after forcing it over it fits perfect! The breast area is perfect and was super easy to pull down to nurse while still fitting nicely!!


Loooooove this dress! Fit perfectly, itâ€™s excellent quality. Highly Recommend!


I love this dress, it suits my curvy figure perfectly and it's easy to breastfeed while wearing it. I might buy another one in a different color.


I trusted the previous reviews before I bought this dress and I was not disappointed. I love it. It is made very well with finished seams, a side zipper and pockets. I am so excited to wear it!!!
