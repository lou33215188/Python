Looks classy and stylish, is super comfy. Has POCKETS!!!! and is easy for nursing mamas.


I love this dress. LOVE IT. I wear it to work, I wear it out, I wear it casually, I wear it everywhere. I am working on getting one in each color. IT HAS POCKETS GUYS - POCKETS!


Fit so awkwardly, I'm 5'9" and 170 lbs. this was too wide yet too short.


I hate it- will never wear it - poorly made


I love this dress! Super comfortable, fancy enough for an evening wedding, but I also feel like I could wear it to church on sundays. I am 140 and 5'4". I ordered  small and it fits perfectly. It just barely grazes the ground so I can wear flats if I want.


So comfy and got tons if compliments.
