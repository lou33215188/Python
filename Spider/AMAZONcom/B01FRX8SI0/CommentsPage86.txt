Night shirt material. not good


It was too short, but it is beautiful. I just wish I could wear it.


This product was WAY too large. The fabric was cheap and very poor quality. I do not recommend this to anyone.


love this dress,got  a lot of comments on it.


Love, love this dress. It fit perfectly and it smooths over all my lumps and bumps. It looks amazing on me and the sleeves hit me just right.


Ordered this for my daughter, fits great,so I ordered another one different color.


So pretty! I'm 5'4" and was expecting to have to hem it, but it fit perfectly! I wish the fabric was a little more cotton-y, but it is still pretty.


This dress is so gorgeous. I'm 5'4" and 140 lbs and I got a small. I love it


comfy and pretty


Perfect
