The waist is tight the rest a bit too big.


It fit! I got a 2x and while my measurements were an inch or two off theirs it still fit. Super happy with it, I would definitely recommend giving it a try.


I love this dress. As a large chested woman I'm always afraid of things not fitting but this does. I get soo many compliments whenever I wear it.


It's slightly too large, but not quite so big that I need the next size down.


 It's also more see-through than I thought it would be/than it should be.


Great fit - it was just a bit short for my taste so I had it shortened to tea length.  Turned out cute!


Great dress - I am 5'5", ordered an XL, and it comes just to my ankles. Pockets don't cause bulk.


Loved it!! I am 169lbs and 5'5. I bought a large and it fit perfectly. It wasn't too long either.


Great fit and comfortable.  Received several compliments first time wearing it.  I'm 5'-9" and the bottom of the dress hits at my ankles so a couple inches above the ground.


Arrived on time, & gorgeous! Thinking of ordering the other colors!


Love the color and fit. The length is perfect.
