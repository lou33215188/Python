This dress is amazing first day I had it on I had no lie 7 people complement me on it.


Ended up returning this dress. I am 5'9" and the dress was too short.


This dress is SO pretty on.  I am heartbroken to return it but I have to.  The  material is some weird stretchy material that is COMPLETELY see through when stretched at all!


Love the fit... true to sz.  I plan on getting another one soon. Oh and POCKETS! Love this dress... light and airy.... wash and hang dry is what I do.... worth the purchase!


Good quality, flattering cut, cute fabric, and it has pockets! The neckline is cut a little low, you could easily pin it if you're modest. Very good dress for the price.


Very nice dress and based off reviews I was told to order a larger size. Big no no. I will have to return for a smaller size.


Nice fabric. Fits well. Washes easily. Get compliments every time I wear it.


loved the style, good fit. but the dress was coming apart at the seams, so had to be returned.


I am 5ft 4in....short, and this hits about the middle of my shins. Not flattering.


The dress was way to short on me. supposed to be floor length but came half way up my calves. also to small around the shoulders and chest. very heavy material too
