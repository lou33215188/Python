Got what I expected... which is pretty good... I get a lot of dresses like these... the pockets I didn't notice when I ordered... not really into that... the zipper is a little inconvenient for chubby me to work.


Tea length on me and I'm 5'9" so that's a little disappointing.


Not meant for tall people! I’m 5’8” and 135lbs and normally wear a small. This came to my mid calf, like a midi dress NOT a maxi. Sent it back.


Wore to a wedding, got lots of compliments!  Material is quite stretchy, so if you're in between sizes or can't decide, I'd suggest going down a size!


Stunningly beautiful and so comfortable!


Wear heels. It's almost too long for 5'5"


Lovely, comfy dress; many compliments on it!  2XL fit well on my daughter (5'2"  230 lbs), although she had to lift the skirt a little when walking up stairs.  Dark blue with pink roses... so pretty.


I like the dress. The color is a slightly different than the picture online. The dress is made out of nice fabric. I am looking forward on wearing this dress on a special occasion.


Super comfy, flattering dress. Very stretchy. I bought an XXL but could of gotten an XL but I'm still keeping because you cannot really tell. Love this dress going to order more :)


This fits perfect. I love everything about it and got many compliments on it.
