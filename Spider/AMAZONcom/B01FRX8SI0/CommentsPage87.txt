Is a little long but I still love it. It's perfect for what I bought it for.


This is the cutest dress I have ever owned. I bought it to wear to a wedding this summer. I'm usually an XL and I bought and XL. It fits perfect, I have no complaints.


Super flattering! I love this dress. Very comfortable and looks very nice for formal, or casual occasions!


Many compliments everytime I wear it.


Maxi dress was too short for my 5'8 frame


I love this dress! It is pretty, comfy, and fits very well!


This dress is perfect. Fits so comfortably, has pockets, and is NOT see-through. Should be ordering more colors.
