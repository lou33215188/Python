This is great - fits as expected- has pockets - good price


I am reviewing the white dress and I would have given it 5 stars but it is see through. So I am returning it for one of the black ones. The dress is super pretty, plenty of stretch, and a great fabric. But don't buy the white.


I bought this after having my baby girl! It fits great and hides all those imperfection! FYI itâ€™s great for nursing too!


Great dress for the price! Lots of compliments already


Ok for around the house.


Really nice material and very comfortable.


Love this dress - perfect for when you want to be just a little dressy. V-neck is quite deep so an undershirt may be required for some.


Cute dress, love the pockets.  I am 5'3 and the bottom of the dress grazes the floor- planning to wear some wedges with them so hopefully that will help.  Material isn't the best but it doesn't cling which is a plus


I am 5'4, 122 lbs, 32 B, & I ordered a size small. It flows nicely & isn't too long in length. Glad I made a purchase.


Absolutely love this dress!! I get so many compliments while wearing it. As a chunkier lady, this dress fits comfortable and shows off just the right amount of cleavage. And it has pockets!!!
