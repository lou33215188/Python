Wife looks great in it!


This dress is gorgeous and flowy. My only issue is that while the rest of the dress is stretchy, the band around the rib cage is not, and I popped several stitches getting it over my shoulders.


Love this dress the cut is perfect, length is great too


Love the dress. It fits great and is very comfortable.


Really comfortable and pretty. I went up 1 size and it fits perfect. I also liked the length. It's long, but it doesn't drag the ground.


I wore this for my baby shower and it fit beautifully! I ordered the size I wore pre pregnancy and just lifted the waist band to sit above my belly. You couldn't tell at all.


Beautiful dress very comfy just was a little to large. No problem with return was refunded right away.


Nice causal dress. Can be dressed up or down. Nice thick material with pockets.


Cute dresses. But so short. I’m 5’9 and 150 I ordered 2 dresses in a large. Both barely came past my knees. Had to return both :(


Cute, good material, fit perfectly, but zipper split the first time I tried it on. Poor craftsmanship, will be returning.
