I like this dress, very pretty.  Is a little long as I needed XL but didn't see a petite.  Order delivered promptly.  I am satisfied with this order.


Gorgeous dress, a little larger in the skirt than I expected, and will be exchanging for a small.


I love this dress. It is so comfortable and the pockets are fun. The neckline is a little deep but looks great if you wear a tank top under. I will be purchasing different colors.


The material on this is a weird shiny slinky polyester. I'm not a fan.


Heavy!


This is a lovely dress.  The colors are vivid which makes the entire dress pop..


Very nice fabric. Felt much better than I expected for the price. And the dress has pockets!! Beautiful summer print


This dress was everything I hoped it would be. Great quality and fits true to size. Was so great at a party, everyone loved it. I was nervous to wear bc it's outside my comfort zone but it was so comfortable and so cute


I need to return the dress. I ordered correct size. It does not fit. I had trouble with the side zipper. Very disappointed!


Dress is totally see through in the bust area... returned it immediately.
