You will love this dress. The only thing is that it is too long Im a 5'5 and I ordered a large and i will definitely will have to use wedges. But other than that beautiful dress.


This is super cute and I get complements all the time!  Love the dress.  If you are between sizes I would size down.


I wore it to a wedding and it was very comfortable and pretty! There's also pockets but I would carry light items only as the way the fabric drapes will look funny with a phone sticking out of the side.


5'4 180 large fit about right. Curious if a medium would have been more slimming. The waist is a little big so I can easily throw the dress on over my head with the zipper up.


Love the texture of this dress although the fabric feels heavy so if you're 5ft short like me, wearing heels are a must since it does weigh it down. But without heels, the dress will drag do if you're taller this would be perfect. Did I mention this had pockets?! And since its a low v neck a tank top is optional but even without, the dress wraps around nicely. Good buy!


This dress is very thin material and totally see through. Maybe good for a beach cover up?


Very flattering, exactly what I wanted, and fits perfectly!  And it has POCKETS!  A very fantastic dress for the price.


So cute. Fits perfectly and just the right length.


The dress is lovely in person. I wore it to a wedding and it looked great.


Love the fabric. Love the fit and feel. Very happy with the dress. Great price!
