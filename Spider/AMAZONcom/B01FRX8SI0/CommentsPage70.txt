Super cute dress, I bought the extra large and it's a tab bit large in my chest, but it's not a big deal. The dress is gorgeous and looks even better on. Compliments my shape nicely. I will be purchasing additional colors.


Love this dress! I get compliments whenever I wear it.


The material is not so nice and it's very hot in the summer.


This item came defective.  The sewing was terrible.  The whole waistband was not sewn together.  The pockets were sewn together so you could not put your hands in them.  Loved the dress but the quality was horrible.


Very cute dress! I get lots of compliments when I wear it!


This dress has POCKETS!! It's light and swingy, and the perfect length. I am 5'6" and this comes just to the tops of my feet. I love it!!


great for nursing. The top opens up very easily


Super cute and flattering!


Fit was fine, a little long for me.  I liked how billowing the skirt of the dress felt and looked, but overall I felt the material looked a little cheap and wasn't what I had expected.


Love this dress. It's comfortable and it has pockets!!
