Nice dress but it is a cheaper material and runs a bit large. Even for a nursing mom with larger chest.


This is a little big on me so I'm taking this dress and having it altered


I have mixed feelings about this dress, for one the length, I'm 5'7 and it lays right at my ankles. I also don't wear dresses on the regular and prefer the length to cover my shoes. The sizing is a bit on the smaller side but the dress is stretchy. Oh and it has pockets. If you wear dresses regularly this may be a comfortable safe dress for you.


Very beautiful, especially for the price. Very stretchy fabric and would be flattering on every figure. Material has a slight sheen to it.


A nice, comfortable dress that can be worn for most all occasions. It's very flattering, and it does hide those little bulges.


This dress is pretty, but runs large. It is almost unflattering on me and I wish I had sized down. Love the pockets and the material. It is lightweight and comfy, but just too big.


This dress was way too big and the fabric was shiny and stretchy. The structure of the top reminded me of something I wore in 9th grade. I unfortunately missed my return window.


Love this beautiful dress. Wore it to a wedding and had so many compliments.


Absolutely beautiful I love it!! Fits true to size, great material and VERY comfortable. The dress is very sliming if your a bit chunky like me. It was made exactly as described. I told my husband for mother’s day I would like some of the other designs since it’s hard to find a good dress. Definitely worth the money!


Not a fan of the material but the dress is beautiful, and I got a ton of complements when I wore it, and it has pockets!
