I love this, it's better than I imagined. For the price this is a steal. It fits beautifully and is better than the picture.


Fit and flow is good but color is a bit old lady


Really liked this dress. The pattern is great. Was a a little short for heels- I’m 5’4”. The fabric seems a little cheap, but the dress is inexpensive so to be expected.


Girlfriend loves it. Happy wife... happy life.


I'm a 5'9, 22 yrs old and busty, but this was sadly a fail for my body type. It was almost 5 inches too short and the material made me feel very warm. I do love the patterns and pockets but I unfortunately had to return.


This dress is beautiful and so comfortable. It is a very nice, slinky material. I look forward to wearing it when it is too cool for a shorter dress, but too warm for pants.


No a huge fan of the make. But the print is nice. It looks a little too silky,


cute dress, loved the pockets.


I have not worn a long dress since my wedding 25 years ago so I was a little leery of how this would look.  I was very pleased with the quality and the fit.  I wore it to my boss' engagement party and received compliments all evening.  It was extremely comfortable and the pockets were perfect for my cell phone and keys.


Fits perfect. The length is not too long. I usually wear at 12/14 and I bought a large. The material is soft. The dress is very flattering. Can't wait to wear it for an upcoming wedding.
