I love this dress! It fits me beautifully and I feel amazing in it! I have a large chest (I wear a 44DDD) and even with the deep V neckline, everything is covered and I don't need to wear a tank top or a plunge bra with it. The material is thick enough that you don't need a slip, even when you're back lit. I wear a size 20/22, bought a 3X and it fits very well. It is a full length dress; I am 5' 6.5" and the skirt just brushes the top of my feet and I can just barely get away with wearing flats. So, if your 5'7" or taller, you can for sure wear flats with it, but if you're 5'6" or shorter, you'll need to wear it with heels or have it hemmed. Lovely summer dress!
