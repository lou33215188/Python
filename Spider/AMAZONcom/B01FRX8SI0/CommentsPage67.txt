very good material, flows nicely


So pretty and comfortable! I've gotten lots of compliments on this dress. It's elegant but not too formal and is a very flattering cut and design for body heavy ladies..


So comfy and elegant.  I am 7 months pregnant and it fit well over my bump.  I was surprised that the length was slightly short after I read other reviews (I'm 5'5), but it's not too short.  I'm normally 145lbs and the medium fit well.


Looks great on. Colors were much more vibrant than I anticipated.


Based on the other reviews and the sizing chart provided I ordered the XXL. I just had a baby and usually wear a 16 in clothes. When I tried this dress on it was huge! I also didn't like the way the material felt.


The dress is great. Fits good. Size 18/20 and I got a xxl. I took a star off for being late. Was supposed to arrive Friday and it didnâ€™t come until Monday.


Very pretty.  Would get again. Sizing was perfect. Packaged well,  delivered in a timely manner.  The dress can be used for many years since the material is nice.


The fabric is super soft and smooth and fits perfectly. The heaviest is my wife's favorite sun flower.


Nice for the price is just right.


Just a little long.  I'm 5'2"
