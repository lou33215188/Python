I love this dress! I'm 5'7", 145 lbs, 36D bra size, and the medium fits well. It comes to about ankle length. Very flattering and comfortable. I wore it to work and got a few compliments. Will definitely order in more colors!


These dresses are beautiful! People comment on it every time I wear it, even strangers walking down the street. I'm 5'9 and I wish I had just one more inch at the bottom, but that's me being picky. Great dress, highly recommend picking one up


I'm 5'4" and with heals on this dress still had a excess of about 3" dragging the floor. So if you;re short like me, forego this dress or be ready to hem it.


Print is beautiful, the fit was perfect, and its VERY comfortable.  Oh, and there's pockets!!


Love the style and fit. I'm 5'7" and 165 lbs and the XL is almost perfect. I am a small busted woman so the top is a tiny bit big on me but only I notice that. I am disappointed, however, with how thin the material is. I wear it with a slip so it's fine but it would be awesome with a thicker, less flimsy material


It is light and is very comfortable.  Have not worn in public yet that sis why I did not give it 5 stars.  Got it for a vacation in Hawaii, will see if I get any looksğŸ˜ƒ


I love this dress the fit is perfect. The pockets are wonderful the material is light and easy care . Very happy!!!


It's an ok dress, but much too short. I'm 5'6" and the dress hit just above the ankles. It's not a good look. Also the fabric on the top is bulky.


Don't care for the material - very shiny and plastic - other than that it's the same as pictured - just not very nice material for my preference.


I am 5'6 190lbs and I purchased a large! Fit perfect! Flowy and stretchy.. perfect buy!
