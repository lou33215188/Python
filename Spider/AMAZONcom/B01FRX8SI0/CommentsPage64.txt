It looked better in the photo but under a blazer it made an easy to pack casual outfit.


Loved the style and fit of this dress. Only downfall - it was see through in the bust area! You could clearly see the disigns/colors on my bra. To be fair, I am very large chested. So it may not be on someone with a smaller chest.


This dress has quickly become my new favorite dress! I bought the 2x and I am 5'7. It fit perfectly and I have a larger bust. The fit is so flattering. Every time I wear it I receive compliments! Love this dress!


Amazing dress! I'm 150 pounds, 5'6", usually a size 8-10 in dresses and ordered the medium. It fits perfectly. So flattering! Hides the tush and creates a nice waistline. The fabric is comfortable and the length was great, didn't drag even with flats. Plus, pockets!!


Super pretty and comfortable.


This dress has a great fit and I love the floral pattern and color. I bought it because of the cross over front so I can easily breastfeed my baby girl. It will be perfect!


A tiny bit see-through. I would pay more for this same dress in a different material.


I love this dress. It fit perfectly. Loved the length and the fabric and pattern. Ive gotten so many compliments.


Love this print but the dress is not the same material/ material feel as the other 3 I have purchased.  With the material having less stretch than the others makes it fit a bit more snug than others, but still love it!


Beautiful dress.  After reading previous reviews I sized up.  Fits perfect.  Pockets.  Super flattering.  Colors are beautiful - purchased black floral
