I really like this dress! It is pretty, comfortable, and has pockets!  I am 5'5" - and the XL hits right around the ankle.


Nice material, soft to the touch. Beautiful colors and is super comfy! Love this dress and will order another.


i get compliments on this dress every time! love the pockets! great for casual and party wear.


Slightly heavier material than expected.


It's pretty and comfortable!


This dress is very comfortable and the material is soft and stretchy and IT HAS POCKETS which makes any complaint hardly worth mentioning. But I will anyway... It's got a lot of material around the hips so if you don't have much there, you'll still look like you do. But it has pockets. Also the material does not breathe at all so if you're wearing it indoors it's fine but i definitely don't recommend wearing it to a Memorial Day pool party in Phoenix because you may get heat stroke. But at least you'll look cute and get lots of compliments and your friends will buy one too because it has pockets. Bonus for baby mommas, you can totally nurse in this dress. The sizing chart for bust size is what I ordered by and fit was perfect. It's too long on me (5'3") so I just tied a little knot in the front hemline which everyone said looked super cute.


I ordered based on reviews and it was too big. Other than that very happy with dress, good material, washed well


Sizes run a little big.


I am 5'10 and the dress hits me at my lower calf. It would probably be best for those 5'6-7


It fit's very nicely and it very comfortable. True to size. I've gotten lots of complements
