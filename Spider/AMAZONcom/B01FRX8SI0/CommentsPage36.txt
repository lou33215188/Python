The fabric was thick and shiny and not as it looked in pictures. Honestly the fabric was something my grandma would've worn in the 80's. I couldn't click return fast enough.


What I dont like is the gathering for the skirt. It gives the illusion of wider hips because there is so much fabric there. Bummer because everything else is nice. If you're looking to add volume to your hips, this is for you.


Love this dress! Fabric is soft and lightweight,  yet not see through. Bright beautiful colors, AND it has pockets!  I hate when I'm wearing a dress and don't have somewhere to put my phone.


I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered up.


Love the dress! Has an Odor when I opening the packages! Hopefully when I wash it it will go away! But other then that the dress is fabulous!


This dress is fabulous!!! It fit perfectly! I received many compliments. I'll be ordering another. For reference, I'm a size 18/20, 42DD, 5'5" and it just touched the ground in ballet flats, I ordered a XXL.


Incredibly comfortable and flattering fit. Washes well too. Loved it so much I bought a second one in another pattern.


The dress material is very voluminous.. I got a size small, but due to the fullness of the style, looked like I was at least a size large. Not very figure flattering, to say the least.


For the price, I love this dress...the colors are very vibrant!  Can't wait for warm weather!


I really did like the look of this dress, however it made my hips look even bigger than they already are. The fabric was great, and the sizing was perfect, the waist seam just hit me in a weird spot.


Fit perfectly.  I am a curvy size 18-20, and the 3X fit me wonderfully.  So much so, I ordered a second dress.
