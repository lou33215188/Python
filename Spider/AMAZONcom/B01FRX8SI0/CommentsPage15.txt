I am 5'10 and normally wear a size 12 in women's. This dress was much shorter on me than expected, it came up about 6 inches from the top of my feet.  It is very low and can slip open on you so something underneath like a sports bra or tank top works great. I went with an XL and it fits very well, I probably could have gone down to the L but it would have been a little shorter and tighter. I will probably buy another one in a different pattern because it does wear well, I just wish it had been longer and less revealing in the chest.


Loved the dress. Soft and nice material, with pockets. Would have given dress 5 stars but it was to small for me. I usually wear a large, so I ordered a large, was to small. My daughter wears a medium. I had her try the dress on. It fit her perfect. Sheâ€™s 5â€™3 140lbs. I gave her the dress.


Everyone at work complimented me in this dress, I'm a teacher and even students complimented this dress, which is not common. It's comfy, lovely, soft and not heavy or restrictive of movement. Definitely going to be one of my favorite dresses! The pockets are so useful, I wish all dresses had pockets!


I love this dress! I bought my first  in May. It was a black print. I loved it so much that I ordered another as soon as possible. Every time I wear it I received compliments. It fits well, it is very flattering, and very comfortable. I can't say enough good things about this item. My only complaint is that it is not offered in more colors. I would order more if there were more color options.


I read the reviews and went a size bigger than I normally would and it fits great. Good for nursing s soft fabric great for the price. It will also travel well and not wrinkle which is great for a new Mom who does not want to iron. I felt the length was great. I could wear flats without it dragging and Iâ€™m 5â€™6.


Very light fabric, bouncy & flowing. The colors are bright and cheery and I feel like I'm wearing pajamas to work! Got a lot of compliments and loved that there are pockets.


One con: the fabric will snag on almost anything, if it snags I'm afraid it will run. Other than that, great for a summer "business casual" dress code at my cube farm.


Most of the clothes I buy online I end up hating. That being said...I just got this dress yesterday and LOVE it! I love the material, the pockets, the length, the way it hangs on my curvy body ğŸ˜‰, the pattern, all of it! I bought it to wear for my honeymoon in Mexico this month, and I canâ€™t wait. I may buy another one with a different print.


BTW...I bought the XL. I am 5â€™3â€� and weigh about 215 (I carry some belly weight and this dress is very forgiving)


Followed the size chart at the end of the product pics and read tons of reviews. I'm only 5'3" and generally have to hem everything. 36D and usually a size 14 pant.  I ordered size large.  This dress fits wonderfully and I don't have to hem!  I love how the top is flattering without being too revealing.  Empire waist, flowy cut below the waist. Length on me is absolutely perfect. Hits right at the bottom of my ankle, brushes top of my foot without resting on my foot. I could easily wear sandals or flats.  Considering buying in another pattern. Bought the navy with roses. Pattern is true to pic.


I love this dress and get so many compliments when I wear it. It is so comfortable and was not too long which is rare on me since I am large but only 5'5". The only thing I do not like is the material gets warm. It is not very breatheable and I am always warm so if I wear this in a hot environment I cannot get cool.


I ordered a small based on the size chart and reviews - I honestly expected it to be a bit tighter fit. I would order an XS next time. The weight of the fabric is great, doesnâ€™t feel super cheap. I wash and hang to dry. For the price, itâ€™s definitely worth ordering again in different prints!
