Love this dress! It fit great, I did size up like other reviewers said and I'm happy I did.


LOVE this dress! Listened to the comments and ordered a size down. Surprised to find it has pockets which is awesome! Fits great, great price. Bought this for a cruise and I canâ€™t wait to wear it.


Was really hoping to love this but I definitely didn't.


Waistband was too thick, so if you are wide hipped it looks funny on. Fits true to size and 5'6 it went to ground which was nice.


Found material to be cheap looking. It's very light and moves nicely, but is more slinky than cottony.


I'm not heavy chested, and actually think it looks better on someone who is, as it balances the waistband. Colors were true to picture.


Love my new dress!! Very flattering fit, and I love the pockets! The jersey material is soft and lightweight. I didn't realize until later that there is a zipper on the side :p going to order other patterns now because I love this one so much!


Very pretty dress. I love navy with some pink.


Really pretty dress came early and was easy to unpack plus fit just right thanks Amazon ğŸ˜�


This dress is super comfortable! I thought the dress would be longer after reading the reviews, but it was actually on the shorter side for me. I am 5â€™3 (ordered a size small) and the dress was an inch or two off the ground.


Love this dress!  Great fit and super flattering
