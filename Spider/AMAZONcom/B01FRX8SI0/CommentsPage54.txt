Get one size down and it will fit great. I am a medium and ordered small. I love this dress so much, get so many compliments on it, and it is so comfortable and flattering!! Love love love


I'm 5'5" 132 lbs b-c cup size and dress fit well. A little big on top but typical for me. A little short compared to most maxi dresses but I liked this so I can wear flats with it. Material print looks a little cheap but expected given the price. Overall I like it and I would order again


I love how this flatters my figure and I can breastfeed easily which is a huge plus.  I am 5'8 and it went to the floor for me.  I love it.  Very comfortable to wear.


It looked amazing on my daughter. She loves this dress!!


Classy


Fabric is really cheap feeling, fits well except it's a little short and I'm 5'5.


I'm 5'10 and the dress was just a little too short. Too bad because it's so pretty in person!


Love this dress super cute fits somewhat large around the waist so I reordered in a smaller size.


Highly recommend this dress. It fits perfectly. I'm only 5'2" and it is the perfect length which is hard to find for me. I'm a double D and the top of the dress actually fits perfectly, no spillage lol. And it has pockets!


This dress is ahhhhmazing. Silky soft fabric. Perfect ruching to flatter any body type. AND nursing Friendly!
