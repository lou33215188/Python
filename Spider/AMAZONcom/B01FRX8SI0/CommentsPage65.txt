This does run big so you should probably go a size smaller but the texture is so nice.  You feel like you are wrapped in richness.


Very comfortable!


The fit was perfect... I personally wish it was a little longer but it is not enough of an issue to complain about it. I liked how the top part fit perfectly... and it looks great on


Absolutely love this dress! Very comfortable and light! The pockets are a HUGE bonus! Color and design is true to picture. I am 5'7" and it just brushes the ground slightly when I wear flip flops which is the look I was going for! Only minor issue (not even an issue) is that I am busty and this is fairly low cut so I just have to throw a small stitch to close it up a bit but that's no big deal at all.


I'm a rather curvy 5 feet tall. The dress is perfect on me. I goes just to the floor no longer. It's of low-quality fabric, but that is what I expected.


So many compliments on this dress!


I love love love this dress!


While I love the dress I'm a little disappointed that I received the wrong one. I ordered pattern Floral-02 for a funeral and received pattern black. While it's still black the flowers are colorful which seems a bit odd to wear for a funeral.


LOVE it, compliments all day when i wear this! just looks amazing on and perfect fit!!!!


I would usually wear an XL which is what I ordered.  Cute dress...but I think a M would have been the right size.  Needed it right away for a trip, so couldn't reorderğŸ˜�
