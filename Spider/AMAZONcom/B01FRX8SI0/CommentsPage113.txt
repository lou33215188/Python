Super cute! I bought it for maternity pics & fit me with my baby belly perfectly & I can probably still wear it when no longer pregnant !


Made me feel so pretty! Soft and flowy, and omg, it has pockets!!


I bought this to wear to a wedding 12 weeks after having my baby. It's great for pumping/nursing and looks great! I wear a large in pretty much everything, and this large was perfect. I received a ton of compliments on this dress.


Love it. I'm 5'8 and its actually long enough for me. Its comfy and light. I'm a little busty and it doesn't have the weird pulling under my arms to cover my chest. My most favorite part... it has pockets! ğŸ˜€


Love it! Except for the length as I'm only 5" tall so I have to hem it, other than that the size is right on, it's a great deal. I recommend this dress!


I love this dress! I tried it on as soon as it was delivered. I love how loose, but comfortable the fabric is. The large is a little long for my 5'3" self, but nothing wearing the right shoes can't fix since that's an issue I run into often with dresses.


I love this dress, the material is great and the length is perfect! I'm 5ft 2in and weigh 120 and got a small. The chest area is a little too big. But besides that Its adorable.


The fabric was too thin and the skirt was too long (and I'm not a short person). Altogether it felt droopy and cheap- returned.


I bought this to wear as a maternity dress and it fits beautifully. The colors are bright and the fabric lays really well. Loved it so much I bought another one!


This dress is amazing! Im so in love! Being a full figured lady, I always have trouble finding short sleeve dresses that fit my arms. This dress hugs in all the right places.
