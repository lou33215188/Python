Love this dress, and am so glad I bought it! It's super soft and comfy to wear! My only problem is that the pockets are a little small. But, it's quickly become one of my favorites!


Nice dress. Flowy. Pockets. And stretchy. But im just not a fan of the poly blend with a slight sheen to it.


I just received this dress in the mail, and it is super pretty and fit beautifully. The only thing I noticed was a hole is the front of the dress. Which I was super disappointed by. However, I absolutely love this dress so I am returning it and getting a new one.


This dress is pretty and the fit was good except the length. I’m going to return it as it was too short.  I’m 5’7” and it was about five inches off the ground in my bare feet.


The dress is perfect length and extremely comfortable


Very pretty and great material. Will work great for nursing my infant. I normally wear a medium and wish I would've purchased a small though. It's large in the bodice.


Love this dress! I don't do a lot of shopping for new clothes, but I get so many compliments on this dress I kinda want to buy more.


I love it!  Size is perfect, the fabric is wonderful and.....it's just perfect!


I especially like the length. I'm almost 5'8" & it goes down to my ankles.


Loved it so much I bought another!  Very flattering. Got lots of complements on both, even my son said mom looks like a princess!
