This is a gorgeous dress! I got the print with the clematis blooms. I had to order a 2X because that design was not available in an XL, but it fits just fine, not baggy and saggy. However, I am only 5'2", so it's about 4 inches too long. I knew this may be the case going in, and I am still thrilled with this purchase. I had my friend try it on because she is about 5'9", and she looked OUTSTANDING, Especially the "Northern Hemisphere".ğŸ˜† so we are all happy with this pretty dress!


I got this in the black floral and apricot (I think it is) floral. I love me some floral maxis and these did not disappoint. I ordered the same size (M) and the apricot I could pull over without unzipping but the black i had to unzip. They both fit once on but the black was just a smidge more snug. Iâ€™m not a fan that they donâ€™t fit the same but they do still fit so no big deal. The fabric is just shiny enough to make me kinda wonder â€œis this weirdâ€� but not enough to be like whoa I hate this. So Iâ€™m ok with it. Someone else reviewed that the black one when stretched it gets discolored and lighter which yes it does so that kinda sucks but itâ€™s not in an obvious place. The pocket openings could be a little bigger but better than no pockets! Nursing in this will be easy too because the front wraps have enough give to not have to pull too much. Overall these are great and may buy more colors of them. Hope this helps someone!


I wanted to love this dress but I felt super frumpy in it. I ordered my normal size of XL and could have had a better fit with the Large. The waistline on the dress hit at an awkward place on me and made my hips look larger then they are. The material is very nice and stretchy but a little shorter than expected. I am 5ft7in and the dress hit just above my ankles. I will sadly be returning the dress.


This dress is beautiful and I love the soft silky material. I also love that it is NOT see through. My only complaint is that it is not long enough. I am 5'8 and the dress hits me at my ankles. However, my mother who is 5'5 is in love with this dress because it fits her perfectly and hits the floor on her.


I bought this dress as a nursing mom to wear to a wedding. I like that it is easy to pull down the top to breastfeed. I also really liked the pockets. I found it flattering to my 2 month PP body. I gave it 2 stars because it ripped after washing only once (according to the washing instructions). Very disappointing! I would not purchase again since I would like my clothes to last more than one wear/wash.


Love this dress!  It fits perfectly.  The top part of the waist band fits like an empire dress and ends right above the waist for me.  It is becoming and it is my favorite, so far, of the dresses I've ordered from Amazon.  Note:  It falls just above the floor and I am 5/7" so keep that in mind if you are not as tall as it is a floor length dress.


Very nice, soft,  comfortable dress.  I have received many compliments on it.  It launders very well, and will be perfect to take on a cruise.  The fabric is not too thin like some dresses, I have purchased.  The only thing I am not extremely fond of is the waist line, which is a wider kind of elastic that, I feel,  is more becoming in smaller sizes.  I still would recommend this  if you want an easy care, comfortable , colorful dress.


This is a very attractive dress. The colors are lovely, the fabric is substantial but drapes nicely over lumps and bumps (if you're heavy, which I am.)  The only problem I have with the dress is that it's very long.  It's a maxi, I know, but it drags on the floor. A trip to my tailor will be required.  But this dress, the way it's designed, has the almost unique ability to make even an older woman look and feel attractive.  I love it!


Very pretty dress,well made. I'm 5'6-128lbs and I ordered the small fits perfect. Great for just running errands in the day with a pair of wedges or you can dress it up with a pair of heels to go out. Will definitely be ordering more in different colors.


I Love this dress!!!  It's super flattering and covers up my mom belly without making me look pregnant.  It's so beautiful.  It is a bit low cut, but nothing a well placed safety pin or Cami wouldn't take care of.  It's easy to dress up with a blazer, or add a button down shirt tied  for a faux skirt look.  For reference, I typically wear a size 16, 42-35-45, 36DDD .  Im 5'5".  I ordered a xl.  I could have probably been fine with a large, but I like how this fits.
