I get compliments on this dress constantly


Lightweight and flattering. Not a bad buy,


Beautiful dress but fits big.


I love this dress!! I'm 5'6" and I bought a small and it fits perfectly! The first day I wore it ( I have the black color ) I got so many compliments! The fabric is super comfortable and it looks amazing with a pair of wedges just to keep the edges off the floor. And the pockets are my favorite part!! I would definitely recommend this as a summer dress!


Really pretty colors and very soft. I did have to put a cami underneath since it is pretty revealing. I am good with some cleavage but its more than some. Very comfortable and received lots of complements. I am nursing my daughter and it made it very easy to do that also.


Quality and Fabric are good.


Very odd, shiny fabric.  Did't care for it.  Looked like fabric from the 60's.  Pure polyester look.


I get compliments on this dress all the time. It's very comfortable. I'm 5'6", and the length is just about right, although an inch longer wouldn't hurt. The pockets can make the skirt poof out a bit, but it's not very noticeable.


I returned this. Did not fit.


Fits great and has pockets!
