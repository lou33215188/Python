The dress is way too short. It fits midcalf on me (5'8") in a size small which makes it look matronly instead of cute and flowy.


Just received this yesterday and it is perfect! Perfect fit, perfect length, perfect material (soft & comfy). I think I will order another one or two in different colors...


I absolutely love this dress!! I am 5'6" and 200lb and an XL was the perfect size. It's too short to wear with heels but perfect to pair with sandals! I am going to order another one in a different color!


Perfect Fit. Very Flattering. I usually need to get maxi dresses tailored...but not this one. Very happy w/ it. Already ordered a 2nd one in a different color.


Beautiful dress fit to true size. Looks really good on my daughter. Very pleased.


Exactly what I was looking for


Nice quality and fabric. Should have ordered a size smaller.


This should probably fit a regular sized person just fine. If you are tall (5'9+) it might not work well.


Gorgeous dress for the price!


Silky and pretty, although it's a little see through but should be perfect to wear to my sister's graduation in May.
