Such a great dress. I wear a medium and bought a medium. The fit is great and super flattering. I get so many compliments when I wear it. I have 2 colors.


This dress hugs my curves and flows at the same time. The colors are vibrant and the pattern is beautiful.


Love it! A little low cut, but fits beautifully though. I am a true XL and it fit just right.


Lovely dress-true to size & quality material.


my new favorite! great material and very comfortable and forgiving.


hot fabric


Pattern & dress was not what I thought it would be! I ordered a Large which is what I normally wear, but it was too large and didn't flatter my body whatsoever.


Loooove the dress! I got a 2xl, but could have gone a size down.  I'm 5'5, 46-36-50. Ordered another style dress already. Great quality.


Very cute dress! Love it!


The material is very stretchy, if stretched the pattern Is distorted. Comfortable but looks a little cheap.
