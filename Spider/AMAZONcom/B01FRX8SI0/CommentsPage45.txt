I'm 5'6" and 170 lbs, I ordered a large per the feedback in previously comments.  All mentioned how long it was, unfortunately the one I received hits about at my ankles and looks pretty dorky.  The rest of it is beautiful, but length is noticeably too short, which makes the rest of its cuteness pointless.


I absolutely love this maxi dress, and I get so many compliments on it.  It has a great fit, isn't too low cut, and is long enough for me (I'm 5'9").  It washes up beautifully, but I do air dry it.


Beautiful and comfortable.  Runs sightly large.


Very cheap and thin fabric. The dress was not attractive on.


Gave it to my daughter. She loves it. Beautiful dress.


I love this dress. It HASS POCKETSSS!!!


My co-worker asked me to buy her one she liked mine so much,


Beautiful dress but NOT floor length like I expected. I am 5'8" and it was about 6 inches off the floor. I'll be returning :(


I get lots of compliments on this dress.


This dress is so great! I get compliments when I wear it. The black fabric gives the fabric a nice pop. It's soft as well.


This is a great dress. Fits well is made out if nice material. Overall a great buy.
