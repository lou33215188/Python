I ordered this dress in XXL in two different colors. The material is super soft and not at all see through.


I probably could have gone with the XL, but I like having the extra space in the warm, humid weather. Unfortunately, I received a large in one of the colors, while it does fit everywhere except the bust- it's a bit more revealing than I like. We'll see if it fits better after losing a few pounds.


I'm 5'6" and the length on the XXL is more like a gown, since it's much closer to the ground, where the L fits more ankle length.


Beautiful dress! I am a size 12-14 and typically wear XL. This dress has a shiny sheen to it so it looks a little dressier than a normal maxi. I may actually wear it to my own wedding to go home in or if something happens and I just need a backup dress,


I'm in love with this dress. The pictures don't do it justice.  It hides the naughty lower tummy, it has POCKETS, and it's pretty sexy and shows enough chest but not too much.  It's very thin, but it's just what I needed in the heat of the deep south.


I wear it as a house dress.  I bought a couple of them and wear them frequently and they are holding up.  I also like the side pockets.  A lot of women's clothes don't have pockets, it's good for my cell phone.  Manufacturers should take note,  women don't carry purses indoors and could use some pockets


Lovely dresses for the price. However, whatever your normal sizei is ( if a large get a medium


) go down one size . Very giving


I love this dress!! The fitting is great! I'm 5'2" about 160 anbd large fits perfect Just a little loose around the chest. Im sure medium would fit great! But overall great fabric!! Definietly recommend! I have the white floral as well! It has pockets!!!! ğŸ˜�


I really loved this dress. It fit beautifully and the fabric is a nice stretch polyester. I am 6-2 and 280 lb and I usually wear a size 24 pants and I bought the size 3x and it fit perfect. There was probably a 5 inch gap between the fabric in the top of my feet but it still looks good. The wider band in the middle makes the rest of the dress hang nicely. The colors and the design aren't fuzzy they're crisp and very nice colors. I bought the apricot and the black with red green and white flowers on it.


It is Beautiful! My husband loved how it looked on me so that's an A++. It is a good product , I havent worn it all day yet but I tried it on at home. Love that is has pockets! I have a toddler so that will come in handy when I'm out with him. Definitely a good buy. Will try to post a picture later.


This dress y'all. It's so comfortable, first of all. Second the colors are so gorgeous!! I'm wearing it to a wedding in two weeks, and really think it can be dressed up with no problem Third of all...IT HAS POCKETS! No clutch necessary for this girl! I ordered a 3x and it's a little loose, but that just gives you extra room to dance and move around in. I'm 5'2" and it does pool on the floor a little bit, but nothing a pair of wedges can't remedy. I can't wait to order the sunflower pattern next!!


I have read reviews, and took their suggestion of ordering a size down, I normally wear a large, but in this brand medium fits perfect.  I have bought three different styles from this brand, and a medium is good for all three, the length can vary though
