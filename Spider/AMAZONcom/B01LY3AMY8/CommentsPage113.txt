It was beautiful!! I got so many compliments I wore it to a wedding! I usually wear large but read the reviews and they all pretty much said size down so I chanced it and bought a medium and it for perfect!


Fits great. I'm 5'10, normally wear a size 8 and bought the medium. The fabric doesn't seem like it would hold up well after washing. But for the price, who cares! The slight downside is that the slip under the lace has a band holding it up which kind of digs into your armpit.


Very pleased with this dress, fits perfectly.  I'm a bigger lady, 5'4" 180 lbs.  the large fit great.  Very soft fabric and beautiful navy blue.


I love this dress!  Looks so elegant, material is perfect and hangs beautifully when on; I have been looking for a dress to wear to an evening wedding for months, and canâ€™t believe I found it online for such a great price!


Love it! Beautiful dress for a great price. I am a size 16 in pants and X-Large fit perfectly, not to tight not to loose.

Great deal /Fits very nice.


I love this dress, it fits me perfectly well and the material is very good. It was a very good purchase.


The arms are a little tight but the dress fits GREAT otherwise.


This is a beautiful dress, very nice quality. The only issue I had is that the sleeves don't fit tight to my arms. There is a lot of extra fabric. I ordered a medium and I am 5'4'' and 135lbs so a small would not have been an option.
