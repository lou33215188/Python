I bought this dress for my cousins wedding and I got compliments from about 5 different people. I love it and itâ€™s comfortable!


So pretty!  My little lady wore it for a wedding.  Good material, easy to put on, comfortable, and great for a 1 year old to move around in.  I didn't attatch the bow since she fell asleep in the car and it wasn't worth the effort for me- but have a big safety pin handy if you are planning on attatching the bow, as the pin it came with was extremely flimsy.


Fit was horrible..  Didn't look anything like the picture.  I got a medium based on the measurements on the fit chart, but it was overall too large and the sleeves were way shorter than it looks in the picture.


This dress is really beautiful. The quality is great and the fit is to size. There is a plastic on the top so it will stay off the shoulder nicely. Pairing the green with gold shoes and accessories.


Great fit, love the side zip and although I don't get out much - a much loved and truly wonderful person in my life- says the dress look beautiful on me. So - since I trust her total honesty and her valued opinion I am ensnared with the dress....


I ordered this dress for my birthday. The size was muawwww. The dress arrived on time. I love the fit. It was comfortable and elegant to my liking. Thank for sending my order on time. I will definitely wear it again.


Beautiful dress fits perfect


I love this dress. It was slightly big but that was my fault. I got a lot of compliments also. It's a great dress


It's a beautiful dress it's just the bodice is too small


Looks great and especially when you consider the price-- great value for the money. I look forward to wearing it to a formal awards dinner.
