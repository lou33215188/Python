IT WAS NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED TO GET. IT LOOKS VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND I HAVE TO GET IT ALTERED. WE HAVE TO ADD ADDITIONAL FABRIC TO THE CHEST AREA BECAUSE IT BARELY COVERED IT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK WAY BETTER THEN IT DID.SAVE YOUR MONEY!! ON TOP OF IT THEY CHARGED ME TWICE FOR THE SAME ITEM UNTIL IT SHIPPED. WHEN I CALLED THEY SAID ITS THIER NORMAL POLICY AND FUNDS WOULD BE RELEASED ONCE IT WAS SHIPPED. THIS WAS THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I USE AMAZON... THUMBS DOWN MO GOOD!!! :(


I'm really not sure how reviewers said this runs big or how they have a larger top half and it fits good. I have a smaller top half and the top of this dress was skin tight in size large. Quality was nice but I returned as it didn't fit.


I am satisfied with the dress, the red color is on the dark side, which is fine for me.  Also the length is right on the knee, which I would have preferred at least 1" or more below.  Otherwise it fits, feels, and looks very good.


Purchased this dress for a performance. The bust measurement is true to size, and the waist circumference is about right, but the waist sits higher than my natural waist and the sleeves are a little too short. In order to wear the dress at my natural waistline, I have to bring the entire dress down, which exposes a little bit more shoulder than I was expecting. Not that it's too revealing, but I expected it to fit similar to the model, sitting exactly on the shoulder. It would probably fit a little better on ladies with shorter torsos. The quality of the dress is great and the material is comfortable.


I absolutely loved the top half of the dress, but the small was too large in the waist and went down past my knees.  I'm 5'1" 120lbs with a short torso, so length is always an issue.  I was so excited to wear this dress for my friend's wedding, but decided against it because it simply didn't fit right.  Too late to send it back, so hopefully I'll figure out something to do with the dress.


Very pretty dress. I am a bit broad shouldered so the sleeves were a bit short for me. I had to push it up a little bit to make it look like it was supposed to be 3/4 sleeves. But overall very nice and glad I bought it.


The wine red color is beautiful. I bought this for an upcoming cruise...looking forward to getting all dressed up. You definitely need a strapless bra with this dress.


Found the right dress for my friend's wedding. Material is very soft. I'm 5'1" and 145 lbs. Order a small and it was a perfect fit. Dress length was a little below the knees.


This is a beautiful dress. The top makes it look elegant. However, I should have gone up one size as the top is squishing me.  I missed the deadline for returning it and I also have a habit of cutting off taags as soon as I get an item so don't know if it would be returnable anyway. I purchased the blue and it looks much more expensive than the actual cost. You will love it just make sure you get the correct size.


I loved this dress! Used it for a black and white party. Very elegant and simple. I'm 5ft 2in. Weigh 170 pounds and bought a size large.
