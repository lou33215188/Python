I ended up returning it because it was too big, but I will definitely consider getting another size in the future.


I like the dress, but the waist is too short and a little wide for xs. I will have to use a belt to hide those problems.


It looked very beautiful, received many compliments.


Beautiful dress, nice fit!


I returned this as it looked like 2 different greens and I didn’t like the material.


I was surprised that the bodice part is strapless, but overall I love it!


Love it! The material is actually thicker than i expected. Has a very nice hold! And had the lace seems to be also thick enough so it won’t tear easily!


Ran small but I anticipated it and it perfectly. Very lovely for any age person.


I got this dress to wear when I take my boyfriend to dinner for his birthday, I tried it on and it is absolutely beautiful. Fits very nice and looks just like the picture, soft and very comfortable. Can't wait to wear it to dinner!


Love it!
