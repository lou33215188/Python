Beautiful dress. Lovely quality, just a little short wasted for me.


Very pretty for someone that is very slim, but for me too much gathering in the waistline.


Amazing, needed a dress for a holiday work party and this dress was a hit!


Love it! It is truly beautiful!


Nice dress. Feels soft. Fits good. Beautiful color. Impressed!


Cutest dress ever!!!!!


Iâ€™m 5.1 135lbs ordered a large and fits of perfectly


Great fit. Nice lace.  The lining is very thin and see through so I will have to wear a slip.  I'm wearing it to a wedding.  I would recommend this dress.


I like the fit of this dress and i am actually able to wear a bra with it.


Loved this dress. Purchased it for my daughter to wear for a school dance. So flattering, fit perfect. The lace is soft. Very happy with this dress.


Beautiful dress, can't wait to wear it.
