Cute dress but didn't look good on me.


Love this dress! It fits perfectly, the lace is very soft and comfortable and looks great!


The dress is perfect but it is longer than what it seems in the picture as it is measured from the off shoulder rather than the shoulder. Other than that the dress is all good - colour and fabric. I was looking for a short dress and this seemed too long for me


Love this dress! I usually buy a medium in dresses but I ordered a Small for this & it fit a tiny bit loose but I didnâ€™t mind it. I used this dress for my engagement photos & I love how it turned out!


Dress is well made, but runs big. I am about 5'3" and 115lbs and the small was to large. It is also very long and comes about 2 inches below the knee, which I thought looked awkward. the neckline is very wide and when you bend over the lace falls over and again is akward


Top part didn't look right on me the lower part fit good but I still returned it


Cute dress bought it for me but my daughter liked it so ending up giving her. Fits perfectly.


Wow... great dress for the money!  I am 5'5" 125lbs and got a size small and it fits perfectly.  I am in love with the quality of this dress.


Just perfect! I love the dress and have only heard good compliments!


I normally hate shopping for a dress because my body is shaped odd but this dress fits perfect and I intend to buy another.  Perfect for weddings and events. Thank you !!!!!
