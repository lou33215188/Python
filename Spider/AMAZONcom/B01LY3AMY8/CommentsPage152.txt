Love it. Hasty about ordering a dress online but worth every penny. I'm 5'2", 38c weigh 170. Large fits fine. Coulda gone down to medium cuz of the stretch


The fit was perfect and just what it said it would be.


My only regret is that I accidentally ordered black when I meant to order navy. Gorgeous dress. The sleeves are a bit tight, but overall, perfect fit.


The quality, beautiful dress. This is perfect for my outfit as Mother of the Bride in a few months time. Thrilled with it.


I loved all of the photos I saw in the reviews so I decided to buy it. I am glad I did!


The dress fits fine but it is not long sleeved, it has 3/4 length sleeves. It is a beautiful dress though.


Great dress for the price. Received several compliments.


The fabric is very soft and the dress is stunning.  However, I did not like the overall fit.  I Would have preferred it to be more fitted at the waist, however, the pleats do not allow for this


True to size and great length! The lace at the top looks great and stays up. Wearing it to a wedding and Iâ€™m so glad I got it!


Love this dress!! Wore it to a wedding and I received so many compliments.
