Curvy girl friendly dress. I'm 250lbs and the 2X worked well especially considering that I have huge breasts. The dress is very pretty however due to the lace on dress, it got caught on jewelry and threaded out a little. But overall it's a good buyğŸ˜Š


Bought this dress for a special dinner in the Eiffel Tower.... first trip to Paris. Sadly, I felt frumpy and looked pregnant in it.


The details (which help me when I read fellow reviewers' reviews)::  I'm 5'4", true hourglass shape, short-waisted, 38DD, and small menopause belly. This dress was NOT flattering. At 160 and size 10/12, the Large was snug in the top & arms. Fit like an Empire waist. I repeat: not flattering (on me). I believe it would be much more flattering on a longer torso body.


I am in love with this dress! I am 5'7" and weigh 130 and purchased a Small.  Feels so comfortable - true to size. The dress is heavy and I'm very pleased with the quality of material.  I bought this for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding I'm in this October and it's absolutely perfect!  I'll be looking for similar dresses of the same brand!  Thank you!


I absolutely love this dress. The lace is so soft and the shoulders are reinforced with a non-slip strap. I couldn't be happier with it! I also cut off the sleeves for a spring look.


So pretty


I LOVE THIS DRESS. I bought it to wear for a wedding. I'm usually a size 10, and I have a hard time finding dresses that are long enough to cover my booty, not too tight in the stomach area, and meet those criteria without being frumpy. This one is a winner! The off the shoulder is elastic so I think it will stay down when I'm shaking with my mama gave me. And the A-line waist is sure to hide my cake induced food baby. The dress is long enough to cover everything when I'm twisting and shouting. The material is thick so my dress won't suddenly be see through when the cameras flash. This dress is the price of what you'd find at H&M or Forever 21, but way better quality!


Beautiful!  It fits as expected and long enough even for me (I'm a 6'1" gal).  I purchase this for my brother's spring wedding and it'll work great!  I'm very happy with my purchase... Edited to add a photo from the wedding.  On me (6'1"), it was a little shorter than I'd like hitting me a few inches above the knee, but on your average woman, I think it'd hit right about knee level.  FYI, I'm normally a 12/14 and ordered an XL which was just right size for me.  Ordering smaller than that would have made it too short, I think.


I am 5â€™3 and 124lbs; I ordered a small and it fit perfect! I am in love with my new dress and wore it to a wedding just yesterday. I ordered it on Wednesday and it arrived on Friday exactly like the predicted date of delivery. Sorry about not taking more pictures and the background. We were sitting next to the DJ booth and a nice lady at our table asked to take our picture as my husband asked me to dance prior to us leaving. Glad she did bc I hadnâ€™t even thought to get a picture. Highly recommended purchase! I hope to purchase this dress again in different colors just waiting to have a nice event to go to again to encourage the purchase. Soft material and many compliments on the dress and as far as my husband; he loved it! He said I looked Beautiful and he loved the soft texture of the dress. Canâ€™t wait to wear again!


This is a beautiful dress, and it is great quality for its price! I would highly recommend this if you're looking for a cute semi-casual black dress. It is made of a stretchy material, so it would fit most body types if ordered in the correct size. I gave it four stars because there were a few minor snags I had to cut off.


Followed reviews and size guide to order. Fit true to size. Usually wear 14W-16 & bought this in XL. Definitely needed a strapless bra as there is not one built in. Lace is stretchy and soft enough to be comfortable. Covers arms without binding. Shoulders stay put too. Having a bit of a larger midriff, this hid flaws well and pretty neckline helped draw attention upward. Length is a couple of inches below the knee. I'm 5'4". Bought to wear to a daytime April wedding. Material is not heavy. Just trying it on brought several compliments from my daughter and friends.
