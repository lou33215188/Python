Beautiful and elegant! Ordered both small and medium and the medium fit perfect.  Usually take a small.


Perfect for NYE.  Doesn't wrinkle so good for travel.  Mine had a lot of static electricity when I opened it up.  Once I fixed that it was fine.


Very pretty dress and well made but the style does not suit my body type.


Would give 5 stars, not simply just do to the fact that the dress I ordered was dark burgundy and the one I opened was bright red. Arrived quickly, and the dress is great quality. Wore it to a wedding and got complimented more times than I could count. Overall would recommend buying


I wore this for a fundraiser and I got tons of compliments on my dress, I will definitely but another one in a different color for another event


Beautiful dress.  Perfect fit.


A very cute and flattering dress.


This dress fits great and looks gorgeous!!


Love this dress. You won't disappointed. I had so many compliments from this dress and I was asked where I got it from.


I'm 5.7 with 150 pounds, C large cup, I bought the size S and it fits me perfect. I  would definitely buy another color. Ooh and I  added 2 different belt. The dress is stretchy and comfortable. Nice material.
