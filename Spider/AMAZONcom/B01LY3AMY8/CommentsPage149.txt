Fits perfect per chart


Absolutely LOVE this dress.  I am 5'7" 140 pounds and I ordered a small and it fits perfectly.  Really good quality for the price.


I love this dress! It fits perfectly!


My 12 yr old purchased this dresses for a school dance. We had to have the dress tailored a bit but she loved it. And she looked beautiful in it.


I normally wear a medium so this fit perfectly! It was comfortable and it made me feel very sassy. I bought it to wear to a work Holiday Party, but I am probably go to find more reasons to wear this dress.


Loved it! Size 8, 5’10”, size medium was a perfect fit. Great quality material, will most likely buy in multiple colors and styles.


I liked the dress, but it was short wasted. I returned it and ordered a different size.


Love the fit...received many compliments when I wore it to a gala event.


Didn’t look goog


Super cute!!
