Received this yesterday. It fits perfectly and is beautiful! Can't wait to wear it to a wedding in a few weeks!


LOVE IT for the price.  I'm, short, though, and it needed to be hemmed.  Bust never fell down... me.. 36B.  Was so pretty, and fit so well.  Impressed for the price.


Was a little disappointed in the sizing - I will try to have it tailored to fit better - love the look - just doesn't fit well.


Wife loved the Dress


Love it didnot wear as yet but tried  on and getting another coliur very soon


Love the dress perfect


Got this dress for  wedding and absolutely loved it. Fits perfectly and the sleeves don't ride up like most off the shoulder dresses.


Love this dress. I'm 5'5" and I weight 124 lbs and the small fit perfect. Maybe a little big in the belly area but barely. It's a beautiful dress. Very nicely made and soft. Arrived in 2 days.


I loved the dress! It fit me well, and itâ€™s usually hard for me to find a dress that fits right!


I went according to bust size and others comments and it was too small. It was soft and comfy. Wish it did fit.
