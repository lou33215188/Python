The dress fit well and I was pleased with the product.


I am 5'10", and about 155. This dress fit me beautifully in a large. I got the navy blue which is a deep beautiful blue. I am very satisfied with this! I cannot believe the price for the quality of the dress. I bought it for a wedding and I can't wait to wear it. It's perfect for a wedding, cocktail party, reception etc.  It is dressy without being overdone.  Definitely for the price you should have one in your closet!!


Love it, fit perfect.


Beautiful dress, great value


So pretty


Nice dress,  sleeves are too right


I love this dress!  It looks beautiful and is very comfortable.


Received a ton of compliments.


Waist is loose so I needed a belt to make it look better.  The rest of the dress fits well.


Quality dress for the price. My only complaint is that the lace fans out awkwardly on the back of the dress - at least on my body!
