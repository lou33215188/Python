I LOVE THIS DRESS!!


I'm 5'4" and wear a size 16 or 18 and my chest is a 36DDD..


I wore this to a wedding reception and had so many compliments on this dress..


Loved how light, stretchy, and good quality material, also the color was beautiful..


It is very flattering on a variety of body sizes


My daughter has this dress also and is a size 6 and looked stunning in it.


SO beautiful! Very flattering! I think I'll be wearing this with pearl choker, bracelet and teardrop earrings.


A little disappointed on the size. It is somewhat big . very pretty dress though but just big on the shoulder. Not having it


This dress is BEAUTIFUL. i wore it to a wedding and i was getting so many compliments. i'm 5'9" and its right at my knee. Had no issues with it


Very flattering. Tons of compliments. Fits as expected. Great buy!


This was a dress for a choir engagement.  It fit well, looked beautiful, was appropriate for the choir stand, and fit well.  I will purchase additional in other colors.


I love the design.  Fits perfectly. I highly recommend to any of my friends and family to buy this dress.  I am ordering another one with a different color.  I Am very pleased with my purchase.


This dress is beautiful!! I wore it to a wedding, the fabric is soft, looks just like the picture, is classy, elegent, sexy, a little below the knee for me, very comfortable, fit perfectly, one of my best buys on amazon.


The lace is a bit flimsy, so the scallops along the neckline fold over often. Other than that, it's a classy looking dress and my daughter looked beautiful in it. Can't complain for the price.


I bought this to wear on Valentine's Day.  I will wear it next year because it was too cold this year.  I just love this dress.  My sister tried to talk me out of it.  She wanted it for wardrobe.  I wouldn't give it up!
