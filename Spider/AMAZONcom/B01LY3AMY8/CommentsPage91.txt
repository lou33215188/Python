It was a little bigger from the waist down, but I still give it 5 stars. My mom couldnt stop saying how classy and feminine it looked on


fit just right


My birthday is coming up in December, and I bought this dress for that occasion. I love it and it fits perfectly! Probably will wear it before December!!


Good fit good material great little party/ cocktail dress


Looks great fits well and arrived on time


just beautiful


Lovely and flirty, I feel pretty in it.  Comfortable and feminine.  Neckline very flattering.  No bra necessary.  Was a great find, will wear it New Year's Eve.  Unbelievable price.  Wish the lace overlay was a little better quality and feel, but when you stand back, it's a very attractive dress.


Ive purchased from Missmay in the past and again I am very satisfied with my purchase.


I chose this dress to go to a friend's wedding. I got tons of compliments.  The dress was definitely comfortable, even considering I was bloated. It was also a decent length. The fabric was nice and soft. I'm 5'7, 228 lbs and orderes an xl. Fit perfectly. Overall a very good buy.


Really pretty dress, sleeves are a bit short, however and that's a size medium and I'm 5'3"
