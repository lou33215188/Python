Love this dress! Wore it for a work Christmas party and I got a lot of compliments on it. I plan to wear it for one of my wedding showers this month!


This dress fit beautifully as I hosted my sorority sister’s wedding... it was the perfect length for me.. I am 5’4 and weigh around 175... the downside is the padding at the top is not for busty women like myself... I had to find a blue bra to place under it or I would’ve been exposed..


I am very disapointed because I fell in love with the dress the moment I saw it, I was going to take it to a wedding that is in 3 days, but instead I received a completely different dress, that is not ugly, but is not fair!!!


Way more red than expected.


very comfortable. Fits as expected


The top part fit good, but the bottom have is very wrinkled and stiff.


bought this dress to wear in my daughters wedding.


soft lace with a little stretch, very comfortable and flattering.


hits just below my knee


I love this dress.  Fits as expected.  Pretty.


Beautiful in person. The dress fits perfectly, not tight and not loose. Arms are the right length, shoulders have a material that prevents from slipping down. The material is very soft and comfortable. Overall design is beautiful and the color is true to the picture. Great price for a beautiful dress!


so far so good :-)
