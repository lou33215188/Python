I never write reviews, but this dress is BEAUTIFUL!!! wore to a wedding a week ago and got a lot of compliments. It fit as expected, I'm very happy I purchased this & would tell whomever is reading this to buy it!!!!


Love this dress. Beautiful, flattering, and comfortable.


This dress is so comfortable and flows well.  I'm normally a medium/large and got the medium based on reviews, which is even a little bit. Recommend ordering down a size. Glad I read the reviews to learn this before ordering.


Bought this dress for my bridal party for a fall wedding,  color was perfect, for was flattering on various body types. All 4 ladies loved it.


Love it!!!


Fits really well and I received a lot of compliments from it definitely no complaints from me but I do wish the front didn't raise up in the middle my necklace would go behind it or get snagged in it


Wrong item received !!!!


Absolutely beautiful dress from the bottom to the top. Quality was amazing and the dress is perfect for a dance Iâ€™m going to. Will buy again.


Beautiful dress, just a tad large.


So comfortable and flattering!!!!! I'm a size 14; 40DD and the 2XL fit comfortably... Not sure if a smaller size would've looked as good.
