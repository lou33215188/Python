My niece looks lovely. The dress fits perfect no alterations needed.


I love the dress was comfortable and it wasn't snug at all. The dress is also easy to move in.


It's beautiful.  The fabric so very nice.  Will wear it a lot.


A very beautiful dress but did not fit me well.


Seriously stunning and comfortable and stretchy and beautiful


Got this for a prom were holding at our church. I received compliments all night on this dress. This is a dress I can seriously wear again to almost any event it's gorgeous. I'm 5'3 and 140lbs, pear-shaped, and I ordered a small. I would say these are definitely woman's sizes and not juniors. This dress had ample room and is very well made. It was a little longer on me just because I'm short, so I opted for heels instead of booties to wear it with. It really is such a classy dress! You cant go wrong! It was really comfortable to wear, not tight or restricting at all. And it had rubber on the inside of the shoulders to keep it in place. I really cannot say enough positive things about this dress!


BeautIful dress, fits good!


Everything about this dress is perfect! I'll be wearing it for my civil ceremony and I thought I'd need to do some alterations but no need. I love it!


This dress is an A+. It's true to its size and very well made!! It's a great dress for the price!!


Love it purchased it in black in April!
