I really liked this dress. It fits well and is pretty good quality!


Haven’t worn it yet but felt very comfortable on and is a nice fit.


Love this dress... the waistline is higher than I thought, but i  the neckline is comfortable and flirty.


Amazing dress!

This dress fits as excepted, but it is too long for me. It looks pretty and elegant.


Great fit, great quality, and amazing delivery time!


Love love love it!! Fits right to size


Beautiful dress. The lining was not what I expected. Very thin. Will have to wear a slip.


I am 5’6, 160lbs and large breasted. I bought a medium thinking it would be best, but it ended up actually being too big around my chest. The sleeves were a little loose and the waist portion is supposed to hug and it didn’t. So I ordered a small instead and now it fits beautiful! The dresss hugged exactly like it does in the pictures and I feel absolutely gorgeous in it. I bought the red and it’s perfect for Christmas. The dress itself is of high quality and the weight of the dress is a little heavy which also shows it is made well. I’ve been wanting a lace, long sleeve dress for years and I’m so glad I finally have one! If you are thinking of getting a dress, this is the one.
