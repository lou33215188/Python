The dress is well made and the fabric used is good quality. Wore it to a formal affair and got tons of compliments. The fit and sizing of the dress was spot on.


It's a nice fitting dress, the only thing is the lace snags easily.


Really great dress, feels amazing, the top looks really wonderful. Not cheap or fake looking, the lace is really well done. I’m 5’2 170 pounds. I have a DD36 chest. I went with a large, and it worked out well surprisingly. The chest is a bit tight, but it’s not uncomfortable and it looks very flattering.


I just wish it was a little shorter, so I’m going to get it tailored.


I wore this dress for a special event this weekend, and I have never gotten so many compliments on a dress! Love it!


I wore this as a bridesmaids dress for my sisters wedding and I loved this dress! It was so comfortable and fit like a dream. I’m 5’4” at 125 pounds and I bought the smallest there was. Gorgeous deep blue color and I’ve worn this in other social occasions as well!


It was a little bit bigger than I expected. It looked amazing. Grest buy!


This dress is well made and absolutely gorgeous! I wish I could get it in  red or white also. Absolutely love it!


This dress is everything! I am 5’8 , 196 pounds and bought xxl. Dress is exceptional, I got so many compliments.


Very pretty. Great for the money. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the coverage on the tops slips a little but will be easy to fix by pinning it to my bra.


I loved this dress, it is very flattering and the lace is very delicate looking. You could dress this up or down. Great for a date night at a more upscale restaurant and a great wedding attendee dress! Super comfortable and I love the sleeves. I got multiple compliments on this when I wore it to a wedding!
