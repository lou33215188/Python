This dress is as beautiful as it looks. It's a great fit except it's a little longer than I expected. However, still a great dress.


Very pretty.  I am an 8-10 and I ordered a medium.  It is snug, but it stretches and that makes it form fitting.


Even after reading the raving reviews I was a bit skeptical but boy was I wrong. This dress IS AMAZING, it fit like a glove it made me feel so radiant. I want to wear this dress every day. I want to have my braidsmaids wear it. I LOVE IT.


Wife loved the look of it, but it was bigger than expected. Will order a size smaller.


Returned and not washable
