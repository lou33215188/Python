My chest size is about a 34 I went with a medium because I wasn't sure how the fabric would fall on my body. In all honesty it's not big but it's not small either it's very stretchy to wear I probably could have gotten away with getting a small. I really love the dress it's super comfortable again it's very stretchy and super soft and it fits very well and I'm very pleased with it.


This dress is a very nice dress.  It's stretchy and very comfortable.  Can't beat the value for the price. The lace is beautiful and the shade of red was a gorgeous deep red.  Perfect for the event I attended.  Can't go wrong for the price!


Love it, very comfortable, but I am 5'7" 150 lb....i am also long waisted and would have perferred it to sit a bit lower, I got the medium, but the large may have been a better choice.


beautiful dress. wore to wedding and looked gorgeous.


This dress is beautiful!!! Fits perfect! I was expected to arrive about a month after I ordered it and I got it in the mail three days after ordering! I can't wait to wear this to my bridal shower!!!


I was a little anxious on how this was going to fit.  I used to be a petite extra small and now I am a normal small, sometimes a medium in certain brands.  After reading the reviews, I decided to buy the small and it fits PERFECT and it looks beautiful and elegant on.  The shipping was speedy too! I have never been more happier with an online apparel purchase! 5 STARS! :)


Gorgeous dress, super comfortable and unbeatable price. Would buy again and highly recommend.


Nice dress but it was too big for me although I bought based on the measurement guide.


The dress was absolutely beautiful. Quality of the lace was much better than expected for the price. It fit well and I am certain my step daughter is going to look absolutely gorgeous in it for our wedding


This dress is beautiful. I paired it with a black tutu.
