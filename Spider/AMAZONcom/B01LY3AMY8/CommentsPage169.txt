Lovely dress, very comfortable. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that I'm afraid would snag.


I was totally surprised how well this dress fit and how I felt in it.


The dress was shipped & delivered promptly.  It is beautiful and fit just right. Thank you. chela


This dress does NOT run anywhere near close to size! I ordered one size larger than I normally wear and it was 3 sizes too small.


Fit very good and I was pleased with the quality. Shipping was good.
