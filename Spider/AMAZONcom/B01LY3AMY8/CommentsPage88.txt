Sizing is off by a size or two. Very pretty dress and comfortable but the sizing is the only problem.


This is perfect, and I got a lot of compliments on it. So comfrotable


Fits great, good materials, very well made.


I bought this dress in Navy/medium and Black/small, I liked both but ended going with the small. I loved this dress! It was not itchy at all, laid beautifully! I received a lot of compliments on this dress! The neckline is gorgeous, I wore my hair up to accent it. I would highly recommend this dress!


I loved everything about this dress. The lace was not scratchy, and I got major compliments all night long! I am 5'4" 150lbs I got a medium because they didn't have a large available.


Beautiful


This dress is heavenly. I love the rich color and the shoulders. If you are on the shorter side (like myself) then this dress may be a little bit long, but all the same it is beautiful (I would even go as far as to say that the length makes it even more elegant). I would definitely recommend this dress! :)


I wore this to my husband's Christmas party and received so many compliments!!  It is BEAUTIFUL and so comfortable!  Sizing is perfect and true to size.  Thank you!!
