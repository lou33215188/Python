By far the best purchase I've made on amazon. The quality of this dress is amazing. I'm 5'3" and very modest so I was worried about the length and fit of this dress but I ordered a small which fits perfectly. It also hits me right at my knees so it's just the right length!


this dress is very nice


a beautiful dress, excellent fit ,feels silky, will be wearing it to a wedding


Beautiful Dress


Overall a nice dress. I received a lot of compliments on it however I felt I could have gone down a size. I'm 5'6 145lbs and ordered the small. I felt the small had a little too much fabric around the waist and appeared a little frumpier than I would've liked.


I am 6 feet tall, it was a perfect fit across my shoulders, the length was perfect not too short, I wear a size 18 dress and I ordered a XXL.


Beautiful elegant dress!


This dress fits perfect! I have a short torso so I am having the length taken up a little bit. Love the colors, the lace.


this is the best dress I've bought for my wife. it's so nice


Good quality!
