Exactly what I expected. I chose this dress for my wedding out of 4 others. Could be an inch or two longer, but I can pull it down too. It's stretchy and forgiving.


The dress was right on time and fit great. There were a few snags in the lace but I guess thatâ€™s normal for lace from what I hear.


I love this dress from the waist up. Very flattering to the collarbone area and a small chested girl like me (34A) can wear it with a nice strapless push up (PS the small fit perfectly, 5'7" and 143lbs, slightly athletic build, 29" waist, 39" hips). *However* the lace of the skirt came crumpled and it hangs heavily and shapelessly despite my curves. Also, it arrived damaged - the lace on the sleeve was ripped in a few places. I'm returning, but ordered another because the color is great (on the red side of burgundy), and the top is so flattering, and at the wedding I'm going to no one will care about the dumpy skirt but me.


Perfect fit


material too heavy and itchy. Instead of being wine red it was more of a bright red color. Doesn't look like the picture


I got this dress in black and it is gorgeous! Very comfortable and flattering. I loved it so much that I got in white for my wedding!


Love it!  Feel of the material is so soft & comfortable.  Flattering to most body shapes.


Beautiful dress, but very cheap when looking at the details of the material, especially at the neckline.


Beautiful dress....its a lil snug in breast area...but otherwise made really nice...I'm 38d and ordered a lrg


Waiting to see if the color is right for a wedding, it look like it was more burgandy than red. Waiting for the bride to look at it, to say if the color is alright. It fits good.
