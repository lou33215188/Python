Love it so much!


For what you pay for this dress, it is awesome.  I got it quickly and tried it on and it is beautiful.  I don't go to many cocktail type parties but this will work perfectly.


Fits good, a little large, but comfortable. I'm short 5'3" and it was long on me. Hit me about mid calf. Like it overall, more of a serious dress not really a party dress - for me anyways


LOVE the dress it fit beautifully. I read through the comments before buying and saw that many said it ran big so I ordered a small I'm 5'4 145 lbs and 36 dd bust. The dress fit like a glove!


my favorite dress!! so comfortable, fits perfectly, received many compliments :)


Love the dress. Really good matriel!


Just love it! I am 5'8 1/2 wearing 36DD and it fit really good. Silicone stripe keep it on place really nice and secure. Quality of lace is nice and it looks expensive and chic.


This was of very good quality, the fit was great and the material is very soft.  I would buy again if they had other colors.  The neckline is beautiful!


Very pretty. My daughter loved it!


Love it! Great deep cherry red. Can't wait to wear for Valentine's day!
