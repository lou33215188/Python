This dress is so beautiful. It fit as expected. I wear small. And small fits perfectly. Not to tight! I love it.


It's a beautiful dress!  My husband and I swing dance a lot and this dress is perfect!


By reading the other reviews it helped me to make my decision on the size I purchased a size larger the dress fit perfect many compliments always order a size larger than you normally wear and you will be just fine


How is this dress so inexpensive? It was wonderful, fit perfectly, very forgiving and a lovely wedding guest dress. I will buy more in more colors!


Really nice, great price for this dress.  Fits great, looks nice.


This dress works well for me because I am a drag performer. As a male, I naturally have wide shoulders and big arms, and the cut of the dress and sleeves hide them well.


I absolutely love this dress! I'm 5'9'' and 150 lbs and usually wear a medium, but I ordered a large and I love how long and flowy it is! The fact that I went a size up makes it super comfortable and makes it super long for a nice formal occasion (I'm wearing it to my sorority's formal). Super good quality too!


It was perfect! I loved it! Any other colors?


Fits great, very soft comfortable material, I love it


Great Christmas party dress!
