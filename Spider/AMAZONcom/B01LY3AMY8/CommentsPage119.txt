It's elegant & looks exactly as pictures. It runs a bit big, but very comfortable.


This dress is beautiful and good quality. I am 160 pounds and 5 feet 6 inches. I ordered a large and it was way too big. I returned it and will be ordering an M.


Love it but too large for me even for extra small so I had to return it. Too much work to get it altered so I went with a different dress instead. The material and quality is super and the price it awesome!


Fits nicely!


I bought this dress to get married in. Fit perfect & I got tons of compliments on it! Definitely would purchase this again for a special occasion!!


Great fitting dress!!! Looked really nice on and fit comfortably. Thâ€‹is is probably my new favorite dress.


Got many complements when I wore this dress. Dress is well made. Lace is beautiful!


Beautiful fabric and color. Amazing quality.


Extremely comfortable! Had to take it off!


I am in the process of returning this item. I read others reviews and they commented that the dress does run big so I ordered a smaller size but it turned out to not fit properly. Not blaming the dressmaker at all. Beautiful dress just did not fit me.
