I ordered a size up thinking it would run small but it runs right on.  the dress is beautiful and well constructed


Very pretty looking


It's a beautiful dress but it does not flatter my body shape


This dress is gorgeous! I bought a small and I am 5'6 and 121lbs and its still just a smidge big but I will wear it anyways.


I love love love this dress!


Size 16, C cup. The dress fits great. I bought it because I wanted it... not always the best idea, because I haven't been able to wear it out yet! I'm going to wear it to my sisters Kentucky Derby party. Not quite the right dress, but I'm wearing it anyway! It is so pretty!


Another reviewer, of a large size said she was going to wear it without a bra. I haven't gone out of the house without a bra since I can remember! But the dress does seem to hold everything in place! Tight, without being uncomfortable. It's strange. I think I will be able to do the same.


I wanted to take it on a trip abroad, but it's heavy. It's a lot of fabric, and I want to keep my baggage as light as possible. I bought a black empire shirt material dress from Ross instead. Like 1/3 the weight of this dress. So weight might be a consideration, but you don't notice while it's on.


Excelent!!! Just what I expected or even better, great quality, beautiful dress, fited perfect!


Perfect fitting and lovely dress!


Fits perfect, surprisingly very comfortable.  Better than expected.


Amazing product. I'm 5.7 -150 lbs I buy M. Excellent quality, nice color, elegant. Perfect
