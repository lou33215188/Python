Perfect fit and beautiful material


Worked wonderfully as a bridesmaid dress.  Classy, elegant, and modest.


love the dress but it runs small and if you have large breast you have to try until you find the right fit. tried it in a medium as well not much difference.


It runs on the small size. I ordered in an xlarge thinking I might have to have it taken in for my step son wedding but now I have to try and lose some weight. But I love the stretchy feel of it.


It is exactly as pictured!!! My daughter loves it!


Very beautiful dress. Note that the dress looks brighter in the picture color wise than in reality which is misleading. But I've come to expect that so I am ok.


Love it......  I'm 5'2'' - 102lbs and an extra small was perfect.  Very soft and sexy.


Good quality, fit perfectly to my normal American size, did not have to compensate for weird Asian sizing. It was comfy and looked great!


I could not believe how well this dress fit me! I wear a size 8 pants but my shoulders are broad for a girl and the large dress fit perfectly.


Love this dress. The size chart was accurate and it fits great. I highly recommend this dress.
