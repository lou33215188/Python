It fit perfectly in every way. The lace was quality. though the scallops around the neck tended to fold down.


Fits great! Looks great!


Great LBD!! Perfect fit, flattering and very nicely made.


enjoyed wearing this dress purchase a size smaller and they run large


Beautiful  dress  arms are a little  tight but fits


Got a lot of compliments! Really nice dress :)


Very classy


I read that the sizes ran big so I ordered down a size to extra small. It was too little, not happy that I have to send it back for the right size.


Great quality. I was super impressed. Grips on the shoulders are awesome. I'm using it for a friend's wedding. It runs a bit large so I needed to have it altered. Everyone complimented me, very classy looking.


Adorable dress for a fantastic price!  Planning to wear this dress to a wedding.  5'4", wear size 12...bought an xlarge and it fits perfectly.  Love this dress, and I can't wait to show it off!
