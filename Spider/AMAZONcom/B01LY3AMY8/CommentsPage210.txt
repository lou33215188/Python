I'm 5'7", and 180 pounds; my bra size is 36D. I ordered the Large and it fits very well; It's actually a little big on me if anything! Super cute, I absolutely LOVE the shoulders... just wish it was a little shorter... I will probably get it shortened with my seamstress. I am able to wear a normal strapless bra with this. I'm wearing this for my upcoming "21st birthday" pictures and I can't wait! Like I said, it's a little loose in the waist, so I might add a thin, black belt! Would order again!


Love this dress! So sexy and fits great! I received a lot of compliments on it too.


The sleeves were a little loose though and the elastic part wasnâ€™t very well attached to the lace, so thatâ€™s why i selected 4 instead of 5.


Heads up- had to get creative with large bandaids for nipple coverage because the fabric is kind of thin and you could see the bras i tried with it too much.


Iâ€™m a 38F/DDD and had plenty of coverage with the XL, probably could have made a L work since it is stretchy


This is an AMAZING sensually elegant dress.  In  a world of drab and black, the color truly helps you stand out in a crowd.  I received SO many compliments on this dress when I wore it to the Symphony.  For the price, the quality is great.  The lace is well done and symmetrical at the neck line, the flare of the skirt is quite becoming, and the fit, because of the slight give in the material is form fitting, but not restrictive.  I encourage you to purchase this dress is you need a beautiful, glamorous dress.


This dress was fantastic, looked great and fit well. It is soft and comfortable.I purchased this dress for my moms award dinner. Lace is really soft,  slip under dress is satin-like. The fabric has a nice stretch to it. Not cheap looking at all. This dress is true to size. Very beautiful and simple.I highly recommended this dress for any special occasion!


I never shop online but the reviews convinced me otherwise. I got the dress in when it was supposed to, but not at all what I bought. I took it out the bag and this dress fell into 2 pieces. Confused, I pick the part that fell on the floor to see it was a silky-type underslip and the part that was in my hand was the lace half of the dress. I hung it up on a hanger and it was just God awful. Not even in the same ballpark of what I purchased. This experience has sealed the deal of me never shopping online.


The color is slightly different in real life than it is in the picture (I purchased the red one) It fits almost perfectly. It runs kind of small. I'm usually a M-L, and I got an XL to be safe. Glad I did, it's a little hard to get over my head at first, but it's a beautiful dress, the lace is lovely. I'm glad I purchased it. :) (It got here within 2 days as it said it would, it is not damaged or anything, it still had the tags on it, and as far as I can tell, it's fairly sturdy material. I would dry clean it, though.)


Bought in a XXL because I have the curse of DDDs. The length was perfect and the sleeves were awesome but the chest was actually baggy. I attempted to wash it in hopes of shrinkage but it did not, which is probably best. The color looked perfect at my work's holiday party. I could have probably gotten away with a XL but I'm sure the sleeves would have been shorter and I'd be on an endless cycle of returning and hoping for the ideal size. This was a steal for the price and I'm content.


Beautiful dress. The lace is soft and not itchy at all. The cut is perfect, accents the bust and curves nicely. Also the dress is off the shoulder as depicted in the image. I say this because other products I have ordered that look off the shoulder end up being tight and snag up. This has a delicate, sexy off the shoulder look which I love. It is a tad longer than in the picture. I am just around 5' 1" and the dress ends just past my knee. I don't have a problem with it though. It is still a lovely addition to my wardrobe.


Really lovely dress. Nice color (as pictured) and good material. Fits as described (I am 5'7" and 145 lbs, medium fit perfectly). Just didn't fit my body type the way I'd hoped.


Very cute,  however the pleats fall just above my belly which makes it look bigger than it isğŸ˜¬ Same with the hips. I'm 5'5" and weigh 140 so I'm not tiny but not big either.  I would have to suck my gut in or wear spanks and I don't want to do either. The material is very nice and it stretches so that's a plus. I'm not 100% sure I will wear this to the wedding I'm going to but it will be ok if I don't find something that I feel more comfortable wearing.
