Love it! A very flattering style and nice quality!


My husband love it the color and they way fit me wow he said when we exchanged vows


I wore this to work event and was the talk of the night.  Not only did i feel good wearing it I also got so many comments the whole night, and even the following week.


Beautiful dress. It’s stretchy and is great for any body type. I’m about 5’5” and 200lbs. I ordered an XL and it fit perfect.


It was not as dark of a red as I expected, but it is very pretty. Being 5'3" it falls right below my knees, so I will have it hemmed. It is lovely and I cannot wait to wear it.


I was amazed at the quality, fit and am overall satisfied.


The dress it's too cute but, it's a little big for my daughter. wish I read the comments first before I place the order. Other than that fabric very good. Thank you!


Really nice soft material and beautiful color. Didn't fit like the picture shows. It was unpire waist type fit. Didn't sit on the waist as picture had shown.  Maybe I had recieved the wrong one. Fit smaller than expected.  Had to return.


Fantastic dress! I was pleasantly surprised at how well it fit. The lace was soft and not scratchy at all. It was a sexy yet classy dress. I am thrilled with it!!


The material on this dress is exceptional. I purchased it as a dress for graduation and the quality exceeded my expectations. It is heavy and the lace feels so smooth and rich. Love it!
