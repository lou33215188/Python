I'm really happy with this purchase. I'm 50kg and 1,64m.. I bought size XS.


see through and tight..


Such a great dress for the value! The material is high quality and it is well made and a great fit! I have an infant and didn't have any dresses that fit for a formal event. I ordered this last minute and am so glad I did. It got tons of compliments!


I ordered this dress for a Christmas party and when I first tried it on the fit wasn’t what I was hoping. Too long and couldn’t even wear it


Fit as expected. Arrived on time. Looks great.


For the price i was sure it wont berlin MD as nice as the pic, but it's perfect


Beautiful!


This is a pretty dress but just didn't fit quite right so it had to be returned.  I am a little busty (38D) and tall (5' 10") which caused the waist of the dress hit too high up.


Great quality for price! It hits my curves in all the right areas. Super sexy lace accents/off the shoulder look. Would definitely recommend. Great "Little Black Dress" addition to my collection!


Really on the fence about this dress.  Maybe I'm just too old or too fat, but I didn't care for the way that it looked on me.
