I wore this to sing in a holiday cabaret and received so many compliments! Looks much more expensive than it is. Perfect for a classy winter event.


Fit was ok, but a little large.  Mainly the dress was heavy in weight.  I returned it.


I was very pleased with the dress - the quality and style - excellent.  This is a  totally personal opinion. For me, too much flair for my body type. I could see myself in that dress if it was produced in a straight, fitted style. Otherwise, the dress is gorgeous!


It fit as expected for a medium and is a beautiful dress, however, the waist is higher than I thought -- more like an empire waist.


this is a very nice dress allways have problems to get the right size do to it i am very tall but it fit great


What a great dress!!  I’m 5’6” and 145lbs.  The medium fits beautifully and is so comfortable.  Couldn’t be happier, especially for the price!


The quality is not as expected but would work with accessories. Very pretty once you put it on, however, I'm a petite size 6-8 standing tall at 4'11. Unfortunately this will not work for me.


Would have been a beautiful dress if the seams didn't arrive torn. The fabric feels cheaply made, and the zipper isn't of the highest quality. But it being too small was my fault. I got a medium. I am 5'4, 150-160, DDD.


nice dress


material was cheap ..once it was washed it clung into a ball
