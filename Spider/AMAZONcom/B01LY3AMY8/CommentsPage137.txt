The dress is super comfortable and very cute! Also fits perfectly. I’m excited to wear it to a wedding. I would highly recommend this, especially for the price!!


Bought to wear for a sweet sixteen and it was perfect!


I bought the dress for a wedding and recieved tons of compliments. Could not be happier with this purchase! The lace is beautiful so be careful not to get it snagged anywhere.


Beautiful dress but way too long. I’m 5ft and it came down to way below my knee. Very pretty dress and comfortable material though!


Love the shoulder straps that help keep the lace up! A bit too big around the waist so I'll have to pin it. It's the perfect length


5'4/170 pounds, usually a size 12. Bought a large.


Shocked at how flattering! Will be wearing for Law School Graduation.


This dress was a great fit, and very comfortable and exceeded my expectations. I needed something last minute for a wedding and with the lace and the flow of the dress it was a perfect fit!


I like this dress, the fit is good, stretches comfortably.  I do a lot of dancing, the only problem may be the dress riding up


when I raise my arm(s).  We'll see how it goes.


Dress looks great- highly recommend for all body types. The grippy at the top of the dress is excellent.


Absolutely elegant.  I really found this dress to be flattering.  I loved it!
