I got the black one and it fit fine, but you could see right through it.  I mean I could read a book through the dress.


This dress runs big.  I normally wear a medium 8/10 but I ordered the small and it fits perfectly.  Appears to be of well quality material and looks really nice.  It has rubber on the inside to keep the top and shoulders up which was a big concern for me.


Love the stretch of it and the lace is very smooth, and it makes me look slimmer. I'm 140 lbs and I ordered small based on other reviews. All in all I love the dress


This dress is gorgeous. Soft, fit beautifully. I may buy in every color. I absolutely love it.


Fits like a glove!!!.  I bought this in small, and I love  it.


I'm typically a medium and ordered a small and it fits well. It's a very pretty dress that I get a lot of compliments on. It's a bit long (below my knees), but I'm only 5'2". I'd like it if it was at knee length better.


I bought this to wear to a wedding and received so many compliments! I'm usually a size 16 (with broad shoulders) and got the XL. Fit perfectly!!


I like the dress overall . Im 5'4 and 100 lbs . The extra small fits ..a little snug at the waist area but nothing major. Will recommend.


Needed this dress for a funeral and it came on time and fit nicely. It fit as expected and I got a lot of compliments on it! Would recommend to others.


I didn't like how it looked on me--the neckline wasn't flattering and the high waist as well.
