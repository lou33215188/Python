Very cute and classy.  Not too short and not too long.  Perfect for my nieces wedding. :)


The top lace is frayed.


Love, love, love! Worth every penny!


Great dress for the price, fits nice.


This dress is a beautiful red dress, it's very stylish and glamorous.  It  is a little long for a petite woman.  I don't think this dress will ever go out of style.  It is a little big around the waist, but I can take care of that.


Absolutely love this dress. I got SO many compliments from people at the wedding I attended. Extremely flattering and stylish. For reference I am 6 foot 200 pounds and bought an XL


Gorgeous lace dress. Fits perfect! A lot prettier than I was expecting to be honest. It was a brides maids dress but I'll be wearing it just because more often than I ever thought.


The dress is beautiful and is lined adequately. The skirt has nice swing and the lace adds a nice touch of elegance. However, the first one I ordered in my regular size was extremely small. I sent it back and ordered 2 sizes larger, and it fits fine. Because it is a fitted dress, you need the correct size, but sizing runs way small. The company was very helpful with a quick exchange and wanting the customer to be happy.


This dress is UH-mazing!! I followed some of the reviews and it really is true to size. I’m 5’8” 170lbs, wear a size 10 and the Large fit perfectly. I received so many compliments and it works amazing with cowboy boots or dressed up with heels. This dress is the perfect “Little Black dress” for any occasion!


I was so excited to get my dress since I saw so many good reviews, but the dress was too small. I was going to wear this to a wedding and I am so disappointed. I ordered a small based on the size chart and the reviews, but the dress wouldn't even fit over my shoulders. The quality and everything else about the dress seemed amazing though. :(
