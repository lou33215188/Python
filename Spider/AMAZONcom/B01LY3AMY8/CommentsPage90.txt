This dress is beautiful, it looks exactly like the picture. It has a weird smell when It comes out of the package and the care instructions are extremely clear. Smell isn't very strong and I'm sure will come out after one was.Nevertheless, it is a very beautiful dress.


Arrived timely and a  wonderful easy semi formal dress for my high schooler! Love ❤️


too small


Absolutely loved this dress! I wore it to a wedding and received so many compliments on it. The cut and fit was perfect. I'm about 150lbs and 5'7, I ordered both a medium and small- ended up keeping the small and returning the medium.


Usually lace drives me crazy and makes me very itchy.  While there is a slight itch to it...as expected with lace, I love the way it feels and looks on me.  Would definitely order it again.  Fit me perfectly, my husband will love it when I wear it on our anniversary.


The dress came earlier than expected, very happy about that. Had trouble finding the zipper but once I found it, getting it on and off were easy. Definitely size down. I'm 5'9, 137 normally in a medium. It lands at the knee and fits decently everywhere else. The top is loose as mentioned in other reviews but a really good pushup bra should tighten that up with not much problem. Looking forward to wearing this to a wedding this weekend.


Beautiful!


good goods, fast delivery, good price


Perfect dress! I am 5'3" and ordered a small, and it fits my figure perfectly. It isnt too tight anywhere and the cut of the dress is extremely flattering. I think this will be my go to date night dress! Shipping was fast and on time.


Just received my dress and absolutely loved it!  Ordered it for my 50th birthday party and had been worried it wouldn't fit due to my first time buying something without trying it on. Very pleased & will definitely will purchase another.
