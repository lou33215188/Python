Bad fit, cheap, lopsided. Iâ€™m now less than 24 hours from a big event with nothing to wear.


This dress was perfect for a wedding I went to. I got so many compliments!


Love it! Ordered my true size Small and dress fits perfectly. Lace is lovely & doesn't itch.


Beautiful dress. I ordered the red and loved the color. The lace was soft and not itchy. Well made and flattering design for all shapes.


I wore this to a Quince Dance and look forward to wearing it again to my company Christmas party later this year.


Love everything about this dress ...is true to size ..  I am a medium and it fits perfectly


When I pulled the dress out the bag, it didn't look to appealing to keep it.  But once I put it on, I fell in love with it


I will be buying this in other colors and styles - very nice quality and fit. Love it!


I love, love, love this dress!!! It looks exactly like the picture. The lace is so soft and pretty. I bought this dress in red. It is a deeper red and very pretty. I'm 5'2, 155 lbs and the medium right just right. I'll be wearing it out for Valentine's Day date with my husband and I hope he'll like it too. Will post pictures soon.


Absolutely loved this dress! I read the reviews and many said to size down, I wouldn't recommend it if you are on the curvy side or pregnant like myself, definitely order your true size. I got this dress for my wedding and everyone loved it! It was so comfy too!


Very nice dress. Perfect for the wedding I attended
