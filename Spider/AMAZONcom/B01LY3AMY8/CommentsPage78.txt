The shade of blue is between a royal and navy color, really beautiful. The quality is quite good for the price of the dress. The lacy fabric is pretty and should work well for vacations a it is virtually wrinkle free, perfect for a dressy look. I ordered a small, but found it to be short-waisted, so I plan to return it and order the medium.


This dress fit my granddaughter like it was made for her. It's lovely and hangs well. Can't wait to see her wear it at her sisters wedding.


Beautiful dress. received so many compliments, its not heavy at all and its very flattering. Planning to purchase in more colors


Love the color, the soft fabric, the design and the fit!


I ordered BLUE dress, but received BLACK. I like it. I’m 5’8” 140 lb got small. Fits perfect.


Super cute super comfy!  I am 5'2" and this dress falls about 2 inches below my knee. I have a larger bust and  this dress fits perfectly.


This dress is so gorgeous! I got a lot of compliments on it. My only issue is that the sizing seems a tad large. I'm 5'4" 145 pounds and a solid medium but I could have gone with a small.


Nice dress for evening dinner but no a ball.


Great quality and looks lovely. I'm 5'10" so it made my torso look kind of short.


I love the style. Oddly, for me it is a little too high-waisted. That may be because it is a little smaller than I expected.
