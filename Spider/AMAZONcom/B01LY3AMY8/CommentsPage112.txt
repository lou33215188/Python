Nice fabric, soft lace and very pretty. Waistline us a tad higher than expected but overall, worth the price.


Great fit, very flattering, nice quality

Stunning


It was very pretty and seemed like decent quality, but was too short waisted and didn't fit comfortably. I'm a very average size with normal proportions, so it was strange that it didn't fit well. Otherwise nice.


Color is not the same.  I bought it based on the color and it actually looks dark an dreary.


Gorgeous dress with a great price tag!


This is a darling, well made dress....I bought a second one!


This is a beautiful, elegant dress and an unbelievable value. I'm 5'8" and it comes just below my knees. I am 140lbs and the small fit perfectly. You'll need a strapless bra. It's a great dress.


I ordered a size down because of the other reviews and was pleasantly surprised that the xl dress fit my bust (42.5 inches). However, the dress was so long that it went halfway down my calves. I'm 5'5".
