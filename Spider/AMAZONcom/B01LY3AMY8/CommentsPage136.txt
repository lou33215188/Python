Great Material.


This dress is perfect (even though the static cling got the best of me!) and fits great. Super cute and will certainly consider purchasing similar styles.


Absolutely loved this dress.  I wore it for a wedding and it was just right.  I got so many compliments on it.  It fit well and was very comfortable to wear.


Beautiful dress! The skirt isn't quite what I expected, but I think it will still be gorgeous for my first wedding anniversary!


Cheap material .does not look like picture.item returned. Unsatisfied


This dress is beautiful but certainly runs too large. I am ordering a medium! Stunning!


I went to a wedding in this dress, the whole evening I was getting compliments on how cute the dress was.


I wore this for my husbands work party and received a lot of compliments. Fit was great. I just had a baby 9 months ago and havenâ€™t lost the baby weight and this made me feel great.


I was nervous to order this as sizing can be deceiving. I was SO happy when I tried it on! It fit perfect and even has some stretch. Perfect for the wedding I was attending. I'm a size 16 and the XXL was perfect!


I love this dress it's beautiful!
