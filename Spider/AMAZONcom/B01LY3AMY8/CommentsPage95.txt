The red is not the same as the picture. It is a bit brighter, but my daughter loves it and it looks very cute on her. She used it as a Queen of Hearts Halloween costume and continues to use it for other occasions


The lace is amazing and so soft and flexible! The material is thicker and not cheap looking. It also goes just past my knees, I am 5'8''. I love it!!!


Beautiful dress and was true to size. Excellent value. Will order the black when available.


It's such a gorgeous dress. But the sleeves are a bit too small. It's not comfortable enough to wear and has sat in my closet for almost a year now.


material a little thin, very nice dress but not what I was really looking for


zipper is hard to close at the middle


For the price I couldn't have asked for a more well made dress. Got several compliments while out at at a nice dinner. Buying clothes online is always tricky with my body shape, and this fit well over my hips while still showing off my waist. Definitely recommend!


This is a beautiful dress. Very elegant. Fit as expected.


Really nice dress. The material is good quality does not feel cheap. The only issue I had is it was too long but Iâ€™m short so I have that issue all the time.


Absolutely wonderful! The fabric is stretchy and comfortable - perfect dress for a cocktail party or a wedding!
