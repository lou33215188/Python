Love this one!  Fits like a glove -size small.  I'm 125 pounds.  Wearing it to a wedding and on Christmas Day 2017.


Very nice, but too short waisted and big in the waist for me.  With the aid of a belt, I can make it work.


Gorgeous, the only flaw is that the petals around the chest keep on folding and don't stay in place, i have to figure something out to keep them in place.


Love this dress!! It was beautiful on! The silicone around the top of the lace kept it in place well. I wasn’t sure if I should get a M or a L but got the L after reading reviews. Turns out I needed a M which is my normal size. I’m 5’ 7” and 160lb.


Beautiful dress and I’m not a dress person!  I’m 5’9” and 150 pounds on a small frame, the medium is just a touch too big on me, but wearable.  I bought the D-black.  I’ll be back to buy it in the blue too!


Very nice and flattering dress. Good buy


Bought this for my 16 year old daughter. It is more beautiful than in the picture. It is classy, not sexy, just the message you want your daughter to send!


Beautiful dress! The neckline stays up, the dress is comfortable and just above the knee for an attractive fit and flare fit! I wore to a wedding and received so many compliments!


Beautiful and fit very well.


Purchased for a Christmas event. The fit is true to size and was comfortable to wear. It’s easy to pull off the shoulder. I got lots of compliments.
