Too big


I'm usually a size 4, (5' 6"/125 lbs.) but I ordered a medium because I didn't want it to be tight.  I should have gotten a small.


LOVE!!!


Measuring sure didn't seem to help get an accurate size for my daughter. Way too big. Shipping was quick though.


unfortunately when I tried it on, the waist was in the wrong place and made me look pregnant.  I will be trying to return it for a refund.


Not what I expected but it was too late to return it so it just sits in my closet


Great quality and fit wonderfully! Very flattering dress


The dress is BEAUTIFUL!  the bodice is somewhat small.  Just order a size up.  But the quality is awesome.


Order a size smaller! This dress is amazing! Great quality with enough stretch so itâ€™s comfortable.


Too big. Should have ordered a size smaller if not two.
