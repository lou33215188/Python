It fits fine, size is precise. However if you 're looking for a shape flattering dress, this isn't it.


It didn't flatter me, but it's a pretty dress.


I did like this dress a lot, I was a little unsure about the quality but it did actually met my expectations. Very nice considering the price!


This is a beautiful dress. Well made and bery comfortable. It has elastic on the shoulders to hold it in place. Will definitely buy again.


Beautiful dress!  I oook forward to wearing it out to a nice dinner date with my hubby!


Nice dress. I only returned it because it was a backup in case I didn't like the other dress I ordered.


Dress was purchased for my daughter.  It  fit her beautifully! She normally wears a medium.  I ordered a large and it was just right.


It fits as expected, but because my boobs are not very big, it's a bit large on the boobs part. But it is a gorgeous dress. My dress size varies from 0-4 and I got a small and looks amazing. Classy, kind of fancy-dressy and sexy. I totally recommend it!


Love the material and the color. It was a little large  but it will work for me I do not want my clothing to be tight. I order one size bigger than I wear. Order what your actual size is on this dress anyway. The dress is beautiful


Super soft it is very very nice. A bit longer than I expected but nice. My bridesmaids are wearing these
