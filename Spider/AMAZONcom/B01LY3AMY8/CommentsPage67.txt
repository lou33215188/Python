I bought a small and it fit perfectly!! I had many compliments on this dress. I truly loved it!!


This Dress is beautiful!!


I put the MissMay Petty Coat under it and wore it to my Work Holiday party and almost every person came up to me and told me how beautiful it was. I would recommend this dress to everyone. I like it so much I am going to but it is another color :).


Love this dress. Great quality. Will be wearing this weekend for a wedding.


Used these as my bridesmaid dresses. I had all shapes and sizes of bridesmaids and it is unbelievably difficult to get a dress that flatters everyone. This dress is stretchy, doesn't wrinkle, amazingly flatters all body types, and is a good price. It was a dream come true!! And it looks so classy!


Love this dress! I'm 5'4, 122 lbs and I ordered a small and it fit perfectly!


My girlfriend absolutely loves this dress! This dress was the correct size for my girlfriend, but it's getting altered for a custom fit.


Beautiful dress perfect for evening wedding. Compliments all night and so comfortable!


Beautiful dress. I wore it 2 weeks after having my baby to my husband's job party. Everyone complimented me. It hides very well my extra pounds. Colors also beautiful.


Love it! Perfect semi-formal/formal dress, in a beautiful navy. Wore for my cousinâ€™s wedding, and wearing again for formal night on an upcoming cruise.


Received a lot of complements. I was going to order a small but decided to order an extra small based on reviews of the dress fitting slightly larger than expected. It was perfect!  I honestly feel that this dress is a safe choice for any woman that is self conscious or has issues dress shopping (isn't that basically every woman, lol?)
