Loved the dress. Fit perfect and Comfortable.


Elegant dress. Wore it to a surprise 60th Birthday Celebration all eyes were on me.


The dress is really nice, but if you have breasts sized D or larger I would recommend ordering a size up or else you will literally not have even a centimeter of wiggle room. It also seems like if you have a larger chest it causes the seam that's near the waist of the dress to ride up a little high in an unflattering manner - it's not a huge issue if you have a flatter stomach, but if you're on the curvier side then it makes the dress look totally different on you than in the photo. I'm about 4'11"/ 160lbs and the Large fit me pretty decently, but in the future I'd probably order the XL for my chest instead. The dress has nice rubbery grips in the top to keep it from sliding around on your shoulders/arms, and overall looked really nice, especially for the price.
