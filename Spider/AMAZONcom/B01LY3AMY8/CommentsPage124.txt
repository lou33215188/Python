This dress was absolutely perfect! This is my new go-to brand when I need a special occasion dress.


Loved how the dress fits.  Got a lot of complements on it.  Felt very comfortable wearing in the dress and how it looked on me.


The dress was really pretty and I liked how I could move around the neckline for my desired look. It fit well and I got many compliments!


Beautiful Dress! The picture does not do it any justice. Perfect fit. I am 5' 4" and 140 pounds. The small was a perfect fit.


The only reason this receive a five becuase I am disappointed with the size.  I should have gone down one size


Sadly, not what I expected. I returned the dress. The lace is thick and pretty heavy.  Felt like a tablecloth.


I loved this dress. I got a million compliments

Beautiful dress! Fits as expected and has a little stretch to it. I'm 5'11" and have a hard time finding dresses that don't look extremely short. This one is perfect and very classy looking.


I wear a large couldn't even get this on.  Although it looks very pretty and good quality.  Man get order next size not sure yet.
