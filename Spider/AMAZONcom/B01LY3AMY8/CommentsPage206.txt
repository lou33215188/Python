I love my dress very nice thanks very much


I absolutely loved this dress. I wore it for my rehearsal dinner and got so many compliments from my family and friends and even some strangers! I'm 5'6" and 145 lbs and the size small fit perfect. The length was long enough to be classy and the off the shoulder look makes it flirty and fun. The lace isn't itchy at all and there's the rubbery stuff on the inside that keeps anything from slipping. I'll probably end up buying the blue one too now.


It's a brighter red than expected. Still a lovely dress.


Perfect fit and nice quality!


Beautiful quality dress, Love it!
