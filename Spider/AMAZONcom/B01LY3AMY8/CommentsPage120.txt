Classy.


Bought a large first according to other reviews, I'm 5'3" 170lbs. Sent it back and ordered XXL which fits but is quite short-waisted. Had to have it hemmed up 5". Nice quality for little money.


Beautiful


Got so many compliments when I wore it to a party


Everybody says it was the prettiest dress of the night!


Very happy

I am 6ft tall, 200 lbs, and a 40DD and ordered an XL.  The dress length goes to my mid knee which is great! I often struggle to find dresses that are long enough for my long legs! The size I ordered fits just right, a bit snug in the chest...any smaller and it would not fit my chest. I have found that there is enough support in the dress to not wear a bra and this makes the dress fit better on me and is still comfortable. The material is pretty good quality, I would just be careful not to snag the lace and be sure to wash it on delicate. The scalloped boatneck rests upright, is modest, and sita beautifully on the shoulders. It's my favorite part about this dress! The A-line shape makes this dress flattering on many body types. The overall design is elegant but the materials make it a bit casual. If you dress this up with nice jewlery and shoes you could make this look more formal. I plan to wear this to my friend's wedding so I will be dressing it up a bit. The fit and color of the dress make your back look smooth. Very flattering!


Overall I am happy with my purchase! Thumbs up!


*Update: I reordered the dress a size up (XXL) and it fits a lot nicer!


My daughter is going to a Quincea√±era and this dress is perfect! It fits great and she looks beautiful in it.


Fit good. Great looking.
