Medium fit beautifully!  Falls just below knee due to my height. Bought the Blue all over lace with short sleeves.


beautiful dress and fit very well. The off the shoulder was very comfortable.


This dress is beautiful.


Nice party dress, great value!


Really pretty dress, but I am 5'6" and it was too short waisted for me so the pleated skirt sat strangely.  However, it looks great on my 5'2" neighbor, so she kept it!


I am 5'0, 143 lbs, dress fit big from my waist, and it was too long for me. The dress came down past my knees.


My 14 year old got this dress for a masquerade themed party.  It's so elegant and beautiful.  We couldn't be happier, she is even considering it for her formal for school this year!  You can't get better for this price!!!


Cutest Homecoming dress!  My daughter is curvy and a large was perfect.  At 6' tall and wears a 12 or 14 jeans, this dress hugs the shoulders perfect and is the perfect length for homecoming.  Thanks for offering an affordable and elegant dress.


I loved this dress. It is perfect for a wedding...even in black.


This wasn't as flattering as I hoped.  Nice quality dress.  Just an awkward length for me.  I'm 5'2"...the medium fit somewhat on the bigger side.
