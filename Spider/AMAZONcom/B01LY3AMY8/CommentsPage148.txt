I bought this dress to wear to my grandmothers funeral and it was too small. I tried to return it and Amazon hasn't responded. Pretty dress though.


Fit well, really flattering!  Would have liked it to be a couple of inches longer, it hit me 2 inches above the knee.


Beautiful dress, went out for Valentine's day and was complimented all night. For the price, it's definitely worth it.


Great dress, looks beautiful.  Ordered a small and fits exact to size.  Am 5 ft 127 lbs.


The dress fit perfectly and is very flattering! Make sure you read the sizing chart, I mistakenly ordered a size too big but was able to exchange it without issue!


Love it! Love it! Comfortable and Classy, all in one.


beautiful dress! I wore it for my rehearsal dinner


Dress was nice but too small.


Color is beautiful. Received many compliments on this dress. Fits perfectly. Very slimming style.


Color doesn't pop.  Cute but not what I expected.
