Great dress for the price! I wore this dress for a wedding and received many compliments. It's flattering, but is a great length!


Beautiful!! Ordered M and fits just right.


Is beautiful color , it just doesn't fit ok on the shoulders ,i was disappointed because I had a hard time trying to fix that part of it , i probably will send it back ,but I do recommend this is a beautiful dress and color


Itâ€™s pretty but itâ€™s much larger than I expected. I made it work but Iâ€™ll probably have to get it taken in. I am a 34 C, 140lbs, 5â€™5. I bought a medium but definitely need a small


I had graduation photos and I loved this! I got an XL and I am 36C, 5â€™7â€�, and 200lbs. Fit great and went to my knees (what I wanted)!


This dress is so pretty! It's a more vibrant red than in the picture, but otherwise it looks like the picture!


Designe not good as


 expected........


Very versatile and flattering.  Great price and can be worn at many occasions.


I am 5' 7', 137lbs, busy size C and the small fit me perfectly. Little hard to get on at first because I did not notice there was a zipper on the side. The material is breathable and the sleeves are thin


Absolutely beautiful dress I got a lot compliments


If someone like to order go for it is as I expected.
