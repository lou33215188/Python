Very pretty


Really love the dress - ordered a small but too tight in the bust so going to give it to my daughter and order a medium.  I am 5'5" and weigh 127 pounds, but am a 36+ bust so not comfortable.  Well made and very cute dress.!!!


I absolutely love this dress. I just received it and put it on right away. The dress is very flattering and the comfortable. I thought it ran true to size. I'm 5'7 and the dress came right below my knee. I got the navy and love the color. The price point at $40 also makes it a win win!


This dress is beautiful!  Sz. Medium fit perfectly. Elegant without being over the top. Absolutely fantastic!


Color was beautiful but the shoulders dropped too much.


One of my favorite and most flattering dresses ever I bought onLine?!?! It made me look young and so elegant at a recent wedding :)))


Item red color is not the same red color reflected in picture. Red color received was a bright red instead of a the darker shade of red shown in the pic


Love this dress! It runs a little large, so order accordingly. I'm usually a L/XL (5'8, size 12) and probably should have ordered a large.


I really liked the dress, but the waist seam fit funny....it hit on me between my waist and under the bust so it looked like I was pregnant. Otherwise it fit fine everywhere else.


a little long
