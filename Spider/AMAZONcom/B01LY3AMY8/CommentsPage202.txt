Adorable! Very classic look.


Beautiful dress


I'm delighted. It's the perfect red. It's pretty soft and a good weight. It has a slip and everything. It fits me well, not too tight (I'm 5 foot 2 and about 135 pounds). I ordered the small and I couldn't be happier.


Minus not having the ability to hang the dress it was amazing


Love this dress!


Love it!


Loved it. But too long.


Very nice...sleeves are a bit tight, but I have large arms


I think this dress might run a little big. There was a good amount of wiggle room which I'm all for. The only thing that I did not like was that the sleeves where also very roomy. They did not fit me snuggly as pictured.  The look was a bit ruined by the baggy sleeves.  Overall I am happy with my purchase. Good quality dress and the color was a true burgundy.


This was late and I'm not happy! I love the dress and the style
