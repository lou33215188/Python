Can't wait to wear this dress.  Tried it on and it's true to size.  The fabric is soft, not scratchy.  Very attractive dress.


Great dress! I was a little nervous to purchase a dress online in case it didn't fit, but the fit is perfect. I am 5'1 and 105 lbs and I got the XS. The hemline for me is about 2 inches below my knee. The lace neckline is really pretty and the lining underneath gives good coverage and doesn't slip. The shipping was really fast - I ordered it about 11 at night and by the next evening when I got home from work it was waiting for me.


The dress didn’t fit right and definitely was not flattering, despite the other reviews that I read....


The scallops would not stay up on this dress, and I had to return it. Also, the quality of material is not the best.


Beautiful dress, quality material, but we had to return as it doesn't fit my daughters small shoulders.


Great quality; fits as expected. I’m 5’9” and 180. Makes me look great; I purchased a large. Usually this style hits me way to high up my waist but this was long enough for my torso. Very happy


Very lovely dress. It  lays very nice, and it's a soft lace. Not that stiff itchy lace that can be so uncomfortable. I'm very pleased with this purchase.


It's a nice dress. I'm 5'7" and 175lbs and I ordered a large. It fits pretty well, comes down to right about the knees on me.


I don't usually buy clothing online because of bad reviews.  But this dress was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT for a wedding after Christmas.  It fit perfectly and I was shocked.  It looked very nice and was very reasonably priced.  I rarely wear dress clothes so I hope there's another reason to use it.


dress looks identical to picture! material is stretchy- i followed the sizing and fit perfectly! perfect for graduations and theatre!
