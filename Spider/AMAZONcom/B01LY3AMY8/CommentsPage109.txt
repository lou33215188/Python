Looks amazing!!


Very beautiful dress. Exactly like showed on the picture


Just got it today and it’s PERFECT!! I can’t wait to wear it. The fit is amazing and it hits me mid-calf. 5’3” 180lbs, it’s very flattering and looks great with silver shoes :)


beautiful, wore it to a Christmas party. very elegant


pretty, but much brighter red than photo looks (more burgandy or darker) thin fabric but has nice fit


I like it


love it it's very comfy


Very cute dress, but is a little ill-fitting for the price. Not very comfortable or breathable either.


The dress is cute, but it was way too big. I'm 5'2" 115lbs... I usually wear size 4. The small was too big for me, but it fit my mom perfectly. She's usually size M. She looks gorgeous. I love the color, the lace, and how flowy it is.


Looks perfect on my daughter who is size 4-6
