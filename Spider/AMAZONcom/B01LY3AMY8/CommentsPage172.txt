The dress was gorgeous, the fitting was great, and the lace adds a beautiful elegant touch.


Everything looked good except it was a little big but I think that was my fault because I was in between sizes. Next time I would get an xl it looked awesome!


Fit great


Excellent!!! I have worn it three times since I hot it and everyone complements me on it.


Love it very pretty and comfortable also


I liked the design didn't like the umpire look


fit small but I can fit in it, not to mention it is beautiful


Love the Dress! Very happy with the fit. I am 5 ft and 120 lbs and the medium is perfect! Dress is well made.


Great purchase! I am thinking about buying this dress in multiple colors.


My daughter looked wonderful.
