Dress is pretty but When i opened the package it had a very distinguished smell. I'm planning on return it.


Such an awesome dress! Very good quality, has a bit stretch so that your curve gets emphasized! Fit very well.


Super cute dress, ordered an XS and it was big, wish they made a XXS.


Beautiful Dress..


Looks very nice on and fits as expected


Loved this dress!


I would like to exchange my dress for a medium


Beautiful dress, excellent quality, gorgeous neckline. Fits true to size. Feels great on.


Beautiful dress! I usually wear an XS dress, but since the smallest size available was a Small that is what I got. I am 125 lbs, 5'6". The dress was pretty loose fitting so I may return it - haven't decided yet.


I love the dress though. The lace is so soft. The color is not as dark as in the photos of the model wearing the dress. The sleeves are also short. For the price, this is a great dress!


Beautiful. I'm almost 5'9.  Great for full figured women with larger busts.  Covers stomach pouch!
