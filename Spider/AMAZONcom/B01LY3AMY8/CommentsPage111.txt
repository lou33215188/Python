Super cute dress. Pretty good quality on the cloth, it doesn't feel like the super cheap kind cloth (both the inner and outer).


Would absolutely buy again.


Love the dress


Too small and there was a pull on the front, right side.


Material quality is good, fitting as expected. Allover great deal as per the price.


Packaging was lacking. There were several loose strings all over the dress. I read where people were ordering a size up. I usually wear a 4/6 or small. I ordered a medium. I am so glad!  Fit like a glove. Great dress for the price.


Pretty, but fit isn't what I was looking for.


Beautiful dress wearing it to a xmas party


Love love love this dress! I purchased it to wear to my grandpas funeral. At first I ordered and large, then a medium and small. The small fits perfect! Def recommend.


Ordered this dress last minute to wear for Christmas. It came quickly and its gorgeous! Very flattering and beautiful. For size reference, I am 5' 4", 144 lbs, a true size 10 pants. I ordered a medium and it fit perfect!


I love it, it fits well
