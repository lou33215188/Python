Did not come as expected. Dress was bright red, not wine/maroon as described, a size too large, and the skirt was matte, not glossy as shown in the picture. I'm generally disappointed but I'll try reordering differently to see if that helps.


This dress is beautiful and fits true to size.


Beautifua and very well made...like decades ago when normal clothes had nice stitching and zippers. Had to return because I'm too heavy for it.  Would buy again after weight loss.


So pretty and feminine.  Nicer than expected. Would definitely purchase again and recommend


I sing, I wear this onstage, it is absolutely the most comfortable flattering dress EVER, I ordered two more in different colors!!


Adorable dress. Very excited to wear it out and fits great


I can't believe this dress is so flattering on so many body types! It's like the sisterhood of the traveling dress. All the pictures of women who posted reviews looked beautiful. I was skeptical that it would work for me but took the plunge and am so glad I did! It's such a beautiful dress. I am 5'6 and 176lbs, I purchased a large.


Fit as expected but the material clinged a lot more than expected for a fit and flare. Returned.


Beautiful dress; I wore it to my cousins wedding and received tons of compliments! I am also PREGNANT, but have a very small bump at this point and this dress did a wonderful job of covering it up! (my bump at this point, just makes me look as though I've gained weight)


Falls below the knee in length. Lovely dress. nicely made - very happy
