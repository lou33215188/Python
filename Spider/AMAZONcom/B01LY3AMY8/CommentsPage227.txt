What I like the most that itâ€™s exactly the way it is on the picture..


the dress was beautiful, I wanted to love it but mine came with snags and the lace by the shoulder was starting to fray. I'm a size 10/12 and ordered a large. I feel as though the fit was perfect! Wish it would've been made a little better but the way i received it, i didn't want to test how long it would hold up especially since i was going to be wearing it to a wedding.


Bought the dress for my wife and she loves it.  Looks gorgeous.  Going to order one in red.


I bought this for my partner's birthday. She loves this color and wearing dresses so she was ecstatic to have this. She liked it very much!


Was way to big but very pretty. I ordered my size that I order all the time. Did not wear it yet


It fits perfectly. Will post pictures later. Size is true to what it says it is.


SO pretty! Loved it!
