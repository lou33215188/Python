Runs very small.


Its very cute on.  modest length. a little bigger in the waist then desired but I also have a curvier body. Overall very pleased


This dress is nicer than expected but very short waisted and I had to return.  I did not reorder the next size as I knew it would have been too large.


I am very pleased with the quality of this dress for such an amazing price! Its absolutely stunning and I feel so confident wearing it!


Comfortable and flattering. Absolutely love it and can't believe it was so affordable.  Definitely would have paid more.


Like the color. Fits nicely. Would be better if it was lined  with a bra in it.


I really like this dress. It's lined well and looks pretty on. Unfortunately it is so large up top that the lining slides down and bunches up. Not a good look on a lace dress.  Will need to return.


Love the dress. A little snug but if id gotten any bigger it would be too big. Bought a 2x.


The dress looks nice and the quality of the material is not cheap looking. I got Small and Im about 130 lbs/ 5 2 and size and length  wise it looks okay. So, for that, I'm giving it 2 stars.


HOWEVER, I CAN'T GET TO ACTUALLY TRY OR PUT THE DRESS ON BECAUSE I COULD SMELL THE BO (ARMPIT) COMING FROM IT AS I WAS HOLDING IT. The kind of BO that makes you GAG. (The reason why I couldn't give more than 2 stars).


I had to just kinda held it away from me to see if it'll fit me or not.


I will returned the one I got and will reorder. Hopefull, my dress will be delivered without BO and I could update this review.


Dress is just like the pic , but runs big I usually wear M but the sleeves where way too loose n the waist as well I I'm ordering one size smaller.
