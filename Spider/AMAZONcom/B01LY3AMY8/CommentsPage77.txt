This dress was amazing and so comfortable! I wear a 2-4 petite and the XS fit perfectly. It has a bit of stretch to it and has plenty coverage so you never have to adjust it (I did cut out the straps). I received lots of compliments and loved wearing it to a formal event.


Very cute, great quality, and pretty good fit. Was a little tight in the bust, but it's a perfect dress for a wedding.


This dress looks and feesl better than you would imagine. We bought 6 total for bridesmaids and they were beautiful. The amazing thing to me was how it looked so good and fit well on different body types.


The xs fit 6 of the 7 and a Small was the other size.  All girls will wear again. Used a sash of blush satin for wedding.


Really pretty dress. Ordered a large. Normal clothing large tops and 14/16 bottoms. 5'4 and 160 pounds. Length is right to knee.


Iâ€™m wearing it to my wedding, myself, friends, and family, love it!!!


This dress is exactly like the description. I usually wear a size large in clothing and that is what i ordered - fits perfectly! The material is great quality and the dress came in completely flawless! It's perfect for a wedding I am attending as it's very flattering! I am even debating ordering another one in the wine color!


This really is a pretty dress and great quality for the price.  I decided it wasn't really what I was looking for, but that was no fault of the dress!


Buy this dress!


Lots and lots of compliments.


I was expecting to be disappointed for the price but loved it!! Wore it for elegant night on a cruise.


Doesn't fit quite like it shows but it's not bad. sleeves were shorter than shown also


Beautiful dress!  Great quality.  Fits well.  Fast shipping. What more is there to say?  Highly recommend
