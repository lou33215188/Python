Never have I received so many compliments on a dress before.


Very comfortable!


The dress is beautiful, it has a really nice feel to it. The waist is a little high on me (but just because I like a lower waist line)


Great service and dress. True color and fit. Looks great on my bridesmaids. Great price for w good quality dress, not itchy at all like some lace is. I wouls highly recommend this dress.


Does not have the appearance of a high quality dress


Cute


Wore this to my shower and got so many compliments! Love it!


After reading reviews about the size, I ordered the bigger size. Glad I did! The dress is absolutely beautiful.  I got many compliments!!


I tried it and it fits nice it feels soft not itchy is flair and its perfect for this sweet sixteen Im invited to.


This dress was quality! The dress material is much thicker than one would expect (in a good way) and the lace was soft and not itchy at all.  Very flattering and the navy blue was beautiful.  Bought this dress for an engagement shoot, it looks beautiful in pictures.  Even when the ocean waves soaked us, the dress is light enough that I dried off in about 20 minutes and still looked beautiful.


I'm 5'2"  and 167lbs, wear a 36DD bra.  Ordered a medium which still fit but probably would have been more comfortable in a large.  The material is stretchy enough that the medium still worked for me.


It was a nice dress, but it is important to go according to the sizes that it has with the pictures.
