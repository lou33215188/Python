LOVE this beautiful lace dress!  It fit perfectly, & it is gorgeous.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!


It's a beautiful dress but way to long on me. I am 5 feet tall. Taking it up would  not be an option because of the lace on the bottom. I gave the dress to my daughter in-law and i am sure it will look beautiful on her.


This dress is really pretty and would be great for a semi formal event or a wedding. It's comfortable, too! Would look really good with a poofy slip to add some lift to the skirt but it's cute as-is!


The dress was beautiful and well made. I got a lot of compliments. It was a little larger than I expected.


Was a little short waisted. It's also pleated which I didn't see in the picture. Overall cute dress for the money.


The bottom of the dress was very full and the open lace on the top went down way too far.  Returned it.


Beautiful dress. It got so many awesome


Reviews I had to try it. Fits great. True to size but the zipper on the side pooches out in the worst way. Super unflattering. Makes your hip look large/uneven.


I don't think I've seen this complaint on other reviews. So maybe just my dress. It's really distracting. Which is a bummer cause the dress is lovely. Stretchy material. Comfy.


This dress is beautiful but the neckline is STRANGE. does not stay up well and it doesnâ€™t flatter me


I cannot say enough good things about this dress. I receive a lot of compliments when I wear it. I love that it's off the shoulder, but not so loose that I'm adjusting it constantly. It's a very good fit and stays in place. I'm 5' 8" and 130lbs. The small fit me just fine. Looks great with a petticoat!


Classic dress great for a falll wedding we are attending.
