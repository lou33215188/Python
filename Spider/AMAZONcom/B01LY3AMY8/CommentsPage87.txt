Returned it. Didn't like the material on the bottom. The top lace looked really nice.


Love the color, meticulous stitch, it's very elegant just the way I imagined. I love the neck. Planning to wear it for Valentine's dinner with my sweetheart. Cannot wait.


Perfect little black dress. Comfortable, flattering, tons of compliments.


Ordered one in red and one in blue. Beautiful cranberry and navy colors. Very cute dress. Quality is ok, which is the reason for the three stars. Some threads coming out of seams and some of the lace around the neckline was frayed. I am 5'5" and 115 lbs and the small was too large, so I will be returning.


lovely dress


Absolutely love it! Perfect fit! Reason why I didn’t give it 5 starts are the sleeves. Pictures show long sleeve but it’s actually a 3/4 sleeve which I’m not a big fan of...but the dress is beautiful!


Cute dress!


Absolutely gorgeous!!!!!!


Beautiful dress, I'm 5' 115lbs and small was a little too big


This is probably the most flattering comfortable dress I have ever purchased!  The dress arrived packaged very neatly and a day early!  The price can’t be beat and there is a good chance I might have to purchase this in a different color I like it that much.
