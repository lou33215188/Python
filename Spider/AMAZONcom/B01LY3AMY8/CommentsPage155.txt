The return process was extremely simple. I was bummed that the dress was to big but other than that it was a great experience.


The fit is amazing and hugs the body perfectly. It isn't baggy around the shoulders, but fits the stomach area wonderful.


The neckline is stunning and the side zipper gives it that fitted, flattering look.  Very comfortable.
