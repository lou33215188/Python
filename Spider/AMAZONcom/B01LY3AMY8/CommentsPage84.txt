The dress was beautiful.  I am wearing it to a dance recital and am very proud of it.


The size is okay, but the waist is too high.  Also the fabric looks a bit cheap.  I decide to keep it and put an overcoat on top of it.  i won't wear it by itself.


This dress is fabulous, especially for the price!  It seems to be made quite well & came through the wash just fine.  I’m 5’3”, about 125 pounds & small fits perfectly.  I received many compliments on it.


had to send back


Beautiful dress and very flattering even for a big girl like me!


I've ordered clothing online before and nothing ever seems to fit.  I ordered one size up from what I normally wear and the dress fits perfectly. The style is flattering.  The fabric is not flimsy and the color was exactly what I was expecting.  The dress can be worn off or on the shoulder I have found.  I will be wearing this as the Mother of the Groom dress for a summer wedding.


LOVE LOVE LOVE! I bought this dress along with another dress to try for NYE this year! This was the clear winner! I can't wait to wear it!


Wish it was a little shorter, it's longer in person (then again I'm 5,3) otherwise. It fit perfectly, and I love the lace.


THE QUALITYIS NOT LIKE YOU SEE IN THE PHOTO. BUT WHAT CAN YOU SPECT FOR THE PRICE IF IT IS SO CHEAP.


BEST REGARDS


Quality is fine, but a very unflattering dress. I am tall and this was not a good look for me.
