Beautiful dress!!


Perfect fit for my daughter who is 5' 3" 135 lbs. size small.


It fit as expected and was very pretty. Although the top part was a bit itchy.


This dress is a great fit.  I really like the suppor the built-in bra gives.  This is a sexy dress.


this is my first time buying clothes on amazon and i could not be more happy with this dress! it fits perfectly and looks even better than expected.


I wanted to love this dress, but it just fit funny. 'It's a beautiful color and very soft fabric. The edge around the chest and arms looked really odd. It was like the fabric under it didn't sit right.


I loved how the lace cut complimented my shoulders but unfortunately the waist was too big and the length was way too long. I felt sexy up top and like a prairie girl from the chest down. I would have loved the dress if it fit snug. Maybe order smaller than what you expect.


I normally wear a 14-16 dress depending on the cut and the XL was just right.  The shoulder elastic held and it didn't move around and the sleeves were definitely 3/4 not a full length sleeve, but it looked right.  The under lining was a bit loose but it stayed up so it wasn't really a problem, I love this dress and can't wait to find another occasion to wear it!


I got so many compliments on this dress. It was a perfect fit and I loved the way the lace looked. I wear a size 16/18 dress and ordered a XXL


I ordered an XL and I could barely get it over my head. When I finally managed to squeeze into it it was COMPLETELY see through and smmoshed my breasts in a very unflattering way. I returned the dress immediately!
