Love it. Just perfect


Beautiful dress and very nicely made, however it does cling a bit in the skirt portion due to static. Perhaps that will lessen after i've worn it more then just to try it on.


However, I ordered in my appropriate size, yet it came considerably too large. I can still wear it, but it makes me uncomfortable in how loose it fits around the arms and how it bunches above my belt when I raise then lower my arms. I would exchange it for a size smaller but I fear I would not get a replacement in time for the event i ordered it for.


I would still definitely recommend this dress to others, just get a size smaller :P there is PLENTY of stretch, and was loose to begin with.


Good quality for the price!
