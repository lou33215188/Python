This dress was really cute and good quality lace. I’m usually a size 4 in dresses so I ordered a small and it ran big. Should have sized down. I’m 5’5” and 140 lbs.


Beautiful dress!


I love the dress & the fit. It's absolutely adorable on....


Nothing like the photo


Beautiful dress. I wore it to a formal and private dinner at a museum.


Nice


Absolutely in love with this dress. It's just like the picture, and the dress itself is really comfortable. Definitely can't wait to wear it for a special occasion coming up soon and see my SO's face when he sees me in it!


I’m 5’8”, 155lbs, athletic/muscular build. I ordered a small and it fit PERFECTLY! This is well worth your money, it’s so beautiful, it’s heavier/higher quality than I expected.


Great comfortable dress especilly for women with widr backs! The only reason I returned is becuase I am 5'2'' and the dress hit me at an awkward length; right below the knees and it made me look really short.


This dress is very pretty and true to size
