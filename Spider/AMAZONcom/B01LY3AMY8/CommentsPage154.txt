I look great.  The style is flattering for me since I am a bit large.  Beautiful dress.


Looked beautiful on birthday girl.


I loved the interchangeability of the shoulders. It can be work as off shoulder, or covering. It was very flattering on.


This dress is awesome! Perfect fit and the quality of the dress is fabulous! I am wearing to a wedding this fall and I can't wait. It's comfortable and looks great!


Classy, beautiful, great fit, and just perfect for wedding guest attire.


I ordered a size larger & it fits perfectly


Great dress for a great price! Very comfortable!


Love the dress. Fits my teenager daughter beautifully. Material is perfect too.


I loved this dress! The lace sleeves are beautiful, and my favorite part is the bottom of it because itâ€™s so flowy.


So freaking pretty. The sleeves are of good quality. Not quite lace. It's cotton with a lace pattern. The dress fits well.
