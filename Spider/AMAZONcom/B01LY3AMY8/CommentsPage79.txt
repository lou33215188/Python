pretty dress but my girl looked like she was going to a funeral.


The dress is soft and pretty, but the white dress I ordered is way too sheer!  I wear a 2x (16-18) 42 DD and ordered a 3x.  The dress fit well but I would have had to buy a slip or pay to have a different slip sewn in so that I could wear it.


Gorgeous dress!! The lace is soft and thick, seems to be good material. I got the red and the color is even prettier in person. Will be wearing this to my company Christmas party. It is just a tad big, but I like my dresses snug. I'm 5'10, 215 lbs and I got a large


Not exactly what I was expecting. The color is closer to cherry red than how it is pictured. The sleeves were too short, so I had to roll them up. The lace was soft, which was nice, but I would day that it wasnt worth $40.


First time I bought the dress it was too small around my chest but the arms and waist was a perfect fit, so if you are a bit bigger in the chest department keep that in mind. Then I got the next size up and the dress was way too big. Ended up returning them both.


I was hesitant to buy a dress online, but this dress is nicer than expected. It’s a decent quality and I love how it looks. I would say if you are between sizes, SIZE DOWN. I’m about 5’9, 130 lbs, and I usually wear a small or extra small. I got the extra small and it fit perfectly!


Loved it. Very elegant and fit very well!! Wearer loved the lace top and lace sleeves.


I have never had so many compliments on a dress before. It was stunning, such good quality and i am going to definitely wear this again to another function. I want to get every color available!! Highly recommend this dress to anyone who is looking for an evening gown in a great price range.


I took the dress to the store with me to find a ribbon to use around my waist, it is very complimentary for my shape with the dress. : )


I had so many complements from this dress!
