Absolutely loved it. Worked great for my awards ceremony.


It fit perfectly, was concerned with the size, did see that other costumers had rated that it ran small. But I followed the size chart and it was perfect ğŸ‘�


Nice look but the sizing is off. I am normally a small, however this dress in a small was more like a large


I'm 5'7" Bust= 40" Waist= 33" Hips= 44" and ordered a Large. It does fit, but I think a medium would be more flattering around my waist. The dress itself is very pretty and true to pictures.


Everything I expected, love it! Plus quick delivery!


Love this dress! I have a hard time finding dresses that fit my shape and I love the way this dress flows on me :) will post a picture next time I wear it


I was a little nervous buying clothes online since it is always hard to see how it is going to fit. It fit perfectly. I bought it for church. It fits me just below the knee (I am 5'3, usually size 10 in dresses) and it is not super tight. The material is nice quality. Everyone complimented me on it.


Runs true to size, I'm a size 6. I purchased a medium but the pleads were a little too much for me around the waist. It made me look bigger. I loved the sleeves and the material is soft, but I returned it.


This dress is as beautiful in person as it is in the picture.  I cannot wait to wear this for the upcoming wedding I am going to in June!


Beautiful dress


Love it


Fits perfectly
