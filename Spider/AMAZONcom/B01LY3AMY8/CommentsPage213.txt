Meh, not flattering. Also was way too big in a medium, I'm 5'5", 134 lbs. Neck line is very pretty, but that's about it.


This dress is beautiful and soft, but I was sent the wrong size and have to return it. Do I dare  try again? How disappointing


Perfect! Very flattering and I think it runs true to size.


This dress is very pretty and the neckline would be beautiful, but the waistline of the dress is very high.  I thought it should fit a bit lower down on my waist.


Loooooove this dress. Would pay $100 for. Also bought in the blue.


I'm 5'4" and 130lbs. This fits perfectly and isn't too tight! It's a beautiful dress that's well made and works perfect for the occasion I bought it for. It also has this great rubber (?) strip around the top so it stays in place; that and the size were what I worried about before getting it.


Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. I'm returning this dress! The material is terrible and not true to size. Don't waste your money!


This dress is so beautiful. I ordered it for my company's holiday party and it was perfect! Very comfortable and flattering. It fits and looks like the picture.


Beautiful dress. Fits perfect, great color. Received lots of compliments.


I put this dress on and it looks and fits great.  The quality of the dress was actually better than what I had excepted.  I will be ordering many more dress.  This dress is very classy.
