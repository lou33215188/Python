This is a very pretty dress.  It seems to be well made and looks as advertised.  Unfortunately, it was too short in the sleeves and the waist so I am sending it back.  To be fair, I usually have the same issues with most dresses or any long sleeved clothes.  I you don't tend to be long armed or waisted this should work great.


Nice style, fit as expected,the material isn't as nice as it looks in the picture but, what can you expect with that kind of price,I would have loved it if they sell it in a better quality material even if the price goes higher.


Beautiful! Excellent quality!

Loved it! Heavy material good for the price. Wore it to a gala and fit right in with everyone else in lavish dresses.


I bought this dress for a wedding it arrived on time and was beautiful. So many compliments on this it fit well and made me feel elegant. I was nervous about purchasing as this was my first clothing buy on Amazon. However I am very pleased and if I could buy this in another color I would! I am 5'4 170lbs and purchased a large.


Beautiful dress! The lace is so soft! It has a beautiful cut. I can't wait to wear it!


LOVE THIS DRESS!  Got a ton of compliments when I wore it!  No one could believe that I only paid $36.  It has a stretch to it so it’s super comfortable!


Super pretty but runs large. My boobs didn’t fill out the top on the small (I’m a B cup), so I gave it to my mom lol
