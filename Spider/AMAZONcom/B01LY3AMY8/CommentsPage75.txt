Beautiful dress and I absolutely love the neckline. I knew this was going to be iffy on my body shape but went ahead and ordered anyways just to try. If I wasn't so hippy, I'd be able to keep and wear, but the cut just isn't right for me. That being said, it's a nice quality dress and absolutely beautiful, and a great price too.


This dress is wonderful!!!!! Everything about it! perfect dress! Comfortable too! I am 5'7 150 pounds and got a small. Fits perfect!

I was reading with other people said sever the next size up which was an extra large and it was big but in the bed but the largest been fine I wear a size 1314 so get a large if you do


Got this dress for a wedding and loved it! The only downsize is that the liner was too large for me on top. Thanks to the outer lace layer it wasn't noticeable. Otherwise it fit well.


i wanted to love this but i dont. it is not as pictured. even with a petticoat underneath, it is very frumpy.. hate it.. returned it. it is over sized and i am not  a small girl


Perfect for any formal family gathering. I like the material, the style, the flow and the arms staying in place.


Gorgeous dress, perfect for fall wedding!
