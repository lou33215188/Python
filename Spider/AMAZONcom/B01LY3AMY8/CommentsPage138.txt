Beautiful, gorgeous dress that fits perfectly! I would buy it in a heart beat again.  True to size and just as advertised in the picture.


The dress was short waisted which was uncomfortable for me. I loved everything else about the dress.


Itâ€™s nice but not for petite size.


Love love love. I'm 5'10" so the waist comes a little too high. But it's still perfect. I got the most compliments on this dress.


Love this dress


Many, many compliments! Fit was perfect.


Love love this dress!


Very cute dress- figure flattering and classic.  I was looking for something a bit more dressy for a masquerade ball, but definitely a good dress for a wedding or weekend event.


love it. Only wish every single dress wasn't so long. I give this four stars only because I wish it came in petite lengths.


True to fit, but the zipper seems to be on the verge of breaking, it sticks at the waist band and takes great effort to zip past that area, either zip up or down it sticks at that spot.
