would buy every color! great dress, just don't wear anything that would snag it.


Beautiful dress that fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. Beautiful navy color. Includes a side zipper for an ever better fit. My husband said it was too dressy for dinner out or the symphony. Love it!


Nice dress, material was expensive looking, very pretty vintage lace, but it was too short-waisted for medium.  It fit but too short on the bodice.


Beautiful dress and the material is gorgeous.


Love it! It’s very flattering.


Very nice. Soft material. It is high waisted so bought a crystal tie belt.


Great fit! The material isn't uncomfortable or itchy.


This picture doesn’t do this dress justice.  This dress is stunning on and is the perfect little black dress.  Fits true to size and length falls right above knees.


Nice dress for any occasion


Dress was very pretty, but it is a little high waisted. I would love it if I was a little thinner.
