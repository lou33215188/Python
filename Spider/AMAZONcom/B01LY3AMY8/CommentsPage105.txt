I ordered this dress a few months back in Black. I love the fit and style so much. It's so figure flattering. I ended up ordering it in Navy as well. These are my go to dresses.


Really pretty, a little sexy, but very classy looking dress.


Sized correctly. Good quality.


Loved this dress. It fit as expected. It was a little bit heavy though.


Beautiful dress but weird proportions, at least for me. The puffy skirt bulges out in an unflattering way. Wish it was fitted better, because it really is beautiful.


I received this dress in mail today and I love it!! The way the lace neck goes along my shoulders makes me feel pretty! It reminds me of Audrey Hepburn!!!


Pretty dress, but the extra large was high waisted. And too small.  That is my size.  Very disappointed.


nice but needs some alterations as it is a bit large. thank you


haven't worn it yet, fits as expected, beautiful neck line, can't wait to wear it


Not as expected it was a little bit cheaper looking than it was on the way pay web page on the web page it looks great but it was somewhat lives and not as nice looking when I got it.
