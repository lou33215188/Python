Cute little borderless, daughter likes but doesn't love


Bought this for my 13 year old and she absolutely loved the way it for & looked. Great quality, very impressed!!


This is a very beautiful dress and fit well. As stated in the description it runs a little large so I sized down to a Large and I still have some wiggle room.  I am 5' 7", 175lbs, 36D and normally where a size 14 or L or XL


This dress was a perfect fit and definitely worth the money; I received many compliments while wearing.  The dress is quality-made and is very flattering as well as comfortable.  I will be ordering in other colors!


I loved the dress, good quality for the price.  But is cut small.. am hoping the larger size will work.


Pleasantly surprised I'm a 46c. I was afraid that I would need a strapless bra. However there is a "tube top" lining in the top making it not necessary.  Lovely off the shoulder dress


It is a beautiful dress.  The waist was a little wide, but worked out ok.


ah I bought both the medium and the large size of this dress so it will look great no matter what size I am


If you buy this dress you will love it .... it is beautiful on .  It's soft and comfortable and well constructed.  I have a hard time finding dresses that I like .. I highly recommend this dress .... it's beautifully elegant....


Very comfortable and classy. I got lots of compliments! I was hesitant about buying a dress off Amazon, but it was the perfect dress and better than what I found in stores.
