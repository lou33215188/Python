BEAUTIFUL true to size...... do not go down or up a size


This dress came quickly and was exactly what I expected.  I couldn't have found a more perfect fit.


Beautiful dress!


Had to add elastic to the back piece to tighten it some


I wore this on New Years Eve. Very comfortable and had many compliments.


The dress is lovely but I'm not sure if the bodice lining will stay up. Would have liked to see it stitched in, but for the money its a great value


Very pretty but too short waisted for me.


The material isn't as cheap as many other Amazon dresses, but it still felt class-less and milk maid ish


Dress is very pretty and of good material. However I had to return it because it was way to big on me.


This dress is fabulous!! I wanted black, but they didn't have my size the navy blue may have been better! I ordered a small and I am about a size 6. Fits perfectly!
