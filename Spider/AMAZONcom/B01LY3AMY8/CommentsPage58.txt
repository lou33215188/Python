The fabric is lovely! The style is beautiful!


I am returning mine because the opaque panel doesnâ€™t cover me right- keeps slipping.


This dress is absolutely beautiful and super comfortable! It fits as expected for me, typically a medium in dresses, and I ordered a medium and it fits perfect!


Very elegant dress. I wish I got a size larger because it does bunch a bit in the tummy area which is annoying. Overall great dress though. There are these little rubber things on the shoulder area so the dress doesn't slip and that's awesome!


My 15 year old daughter wore this to homecoming. It was a nice quality material and looked great on her. The price was great too!


Excellent excellent excellent buy! Fits as expected! Great material not cheap. Arrived literally in one business day, just in time for my event! Ty! Great seller highly recommend! ğŸ˜Š


People stopped me to ask me about this dress! Got sooooooo many compliments! Well made and you can't beat the price!


LOVED this dress. Wore it to my office Christmas party and my female colleagues wanted to know where I got it. Super cute.


So disappointing, this is a really beautiful dress, and seems well made for the price. Too bad it fit like it was several sizes too big. I measure 34" bust, 27" waist, 38" hips at 5'6" ordered a small and it fit like a large. Would have needed an XXS!


Returning  was super easy, wish I could have exchanged it for a smaller size.


normally wear a size 8 or larger depending on the brand.. I am 5'2 140 . dress is so comfy I wanted to wear it to bed. Quality stretchy lace. is very forgiving.


Cute dress I usually wear a 12/14 or an XL so I ordered an XL because I like them longer. It wasn't as long as I like & was loose every where. The row of lace at the very top was soft & because it was loose the lace fell over it is stretchy so had it of been a better fit...it probably would of stood up. Beautiful blue color, light weight & flowing. If it would of been longer I would of reordered it in a large.. it was also short waisted,
