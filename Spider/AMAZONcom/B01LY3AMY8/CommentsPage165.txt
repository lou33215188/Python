Omg this dress fit perfectly! Absolutely love it!


this dress is super cute! i am 5"3, 154 lb, and the medium fits well. the only thing that i didnt like was that it fits below the knee, but aside that its actually really nice.


Beautiful and elegant!


Love this dress !! Fits great!! I read all the reviews before I bought it and the dress is very true to size!!


This is a beautiful dress and its fit perfectly.


Beautiful  dress, but I ordered a large but the waist seem to be to high..it did not sit right on my waist. Tried to get a larger size but they were not available. What a shame!!!


The size was not right with other things I have bought in this size.  Was disappointed.


I am 5'6" and about 200lbs and I purchased an XL in navy blue.. It was beautiful and fit very well.  I will be purchasing the other colors as well.


this is very comfortable, soft and light weight I recommend


Nice dress for a formal event. It fits really nice and wasn't disappointed.
