The material for this dress is a good quality. The dress fits perfectly as other reviewers have said. My daughter loves it and can't wait to wear it to her graduation.


The dress looks nothing like the picture. It's baggy and unflattering and doesn't stay up. Would not recommend.


This dress is absolutely beautiful, the fabric is great and the fit perfect.  I usually wear a medium but I ordered a small and it was perfect.  I am 5'3" and 130 lbs.  I will recommend it, you won't be disappointed!


But still fits and beautifully worn


Beautiful dress! Shipped very fast and fit like a glove! I bought this to wear to a wedding and I canâ€™t wait to show it off!
