I am 5'3 and 125 lbs, measurements: bust 35 inches (28g cup size); waist 25 inches; hips 36 inches...


I bought a medium and in my opinion it runs waaay too big and  is long and goes below my knees, it fits like an xl and i would definitely need an xs if i were to reorder it but it wont arrive on time. but overall it seems like decent quality but if you are similar size to me get an xs lol bc its stretchy too


Love this dress!! Material is great. The length and cut all around fit like a glove. I wore it to a wedding. I felt the the red dress emoji girlğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚


This dress is extremely pretty. I was questioning it since the price is very affordable. I ordered the same size t-shirt that I wear which was a large. Truthfully, I could go down a size if I wanted because the dress has a bit of stretch. I ordered the long sleeve. The lace is stretchy, so anyone with concerns about that, thereâ€™s no worries.


If you want a tighter fit, maybe size down. If not, get your typical t-shirt size.


This is the most amazing dress!!! Flattering, sexy, and comfy!! My sister leant hers to me, I was skeptical since I'm usually a size larger than her, and a bigger chest. Much to my surprise, it was flawless. I'm usually a 14, 38D, and I wore the Large. It was perfect! Buy it!


Perfect fit! Beautiful and elegant for an evening wedding.


Didn't fit as picture showed. Poorly made all the way around!


BUY THIS DRESS!! I was very hesitant before purchasing, but this is my new favorite dress. It's STUNNING and these pictures don't even do it justice. I am 5'5 about 200lbs, I got the XL and it fits perfectly. Just buy it!! You won't be sorry!


Absolutely beautiful dress . Well made, very elegant and flattering. Everyone gave me tons of compliments .


I loved this dress. It is very well made. I was originally going to buy a medium and then second guessed myself and got a large. It was a little too big when I got it, but that's my fault. I'm 5'7, 150lbs, and wear a size 6 jeans and a medium would have fit perfectly. Just didn't have time to send it back and reorder before my event.


very nice dress, just follow amazon size chart, not the one that attached to the pictures of dress ( i did and return my first order, it was to big ) very stretchy fabric
