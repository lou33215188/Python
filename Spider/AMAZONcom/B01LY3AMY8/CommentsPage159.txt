The dress is great but it fit larger than expected


I am 5'3, 160 lbs and wear a 36DD bra. The dress was perfect! I wore it to a wedding.


Ordered for my upcoming wedding. I would say order your normal size shirt. It's beautiful and can't wait to wear it!


I love this dress! I ordered a M and it fit perfect! I am 5'2 140lbs. I got a lot of compliments on this dress. Thanks!


Sexy dress..


I love it


Soft lace. Overall a bit large, so it isn't true to size because I usually wear a medium and it's a pretty stretchy material. Also a bit long in the hem for me at 5"1' with shorter sleeves.


Very beautiful dress and great quality! They run a little big though. The XS was a little big on me and needed taken in by a seamstress.


Love the dress,  came quickly and I got a ton of compliments.  I'm very busty and the XL fit.  I usually wear 14 or 16 in dresses


Due to elastic at top the dress rose up when I raised my arms. I sent it back


Love it great fit and great color!
