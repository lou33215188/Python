This is just a Beautiful Beautiful dress. The fit was perfect. I wore it to a dinner and got many compliments. This is a must have for your wordrobe.


I received this dress today. It came sealed in a bag. As soon as I opened the bag the dress smelled heavy of women's perfume and tabacco. It was suppose to be sold as "new" per the invoice. The dress also had some sort of pet hair on the inside as well as the outside. I wasn't about to try it on. Needless to say I'm returning it for a refund.


Beautiful dress. Iâ€™m usually weary about buying clothes off of amazon because you never know how itâ€™s going to come, but i read all of the reviews and hoped for the best. I wore this to my sisterâ€™s wedding and got so many compliments. I am 5â€™6 and 120 lbs and got the xs


Great buy. Fix as expected. Bought a large, and I am 5'8" 150 pounds. I normally wear larges, and this was true to size.


I loved it, make sure to get a tighter fit to be good at the bust as it's stretchy


Received the wrong dress now I have to return it. I would give this 5 stars but I can't because I got the wrong dress! I'll have to give this a zero but I couldn't even do that due to being only 1-5 star option. I'm so upset about that
