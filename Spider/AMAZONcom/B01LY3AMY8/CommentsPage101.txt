Beautiful and heavy which made it feel more fancy. It was a bit large but not enough to return if that makes sense. I feel like medium will be too tight.....I feel like a belt will give me more shape or maybe I can lose weight but hey belt is easier.


Pretty dress but the lace neckline isn't even and it lays oddly.


This is an incredibly beautiful dress.  It fits perfectly and the color is a rich navy.  My only concern is if it will "bleed" when I wash it.  I'm looking forward to wearing it for several upcoming occasions.


The dress fits perfect! I was skeptical about the size at first because I'm not tall. The dress came on time and is a gorgeous fit.


This dress is beautiful.  It is true to the size and fits perfectly.


I will buy more from Missmay!


Runs extremely small and I still haven't gotten my refund yet. This is getting very upsetting


My dress is gorgeous. It is emerald green, it is a bit big in my waist area so I might end up getting it hemmed. However, I will be wearing it often and it’s not enough of a problem to offset the benefits.:)


I received so many compliments on this dress! It fit great and was perfect for a spring wedding. The sleeves have rubber grips so it doesn't ride up on your shoulders. I am 5'4 135lbs and I ordered a small. The material is great quality for the price! I would definitely recommend this dress.


nice color and fit me on 5'2" well.


Beautiful color and soft lace. I’m 5”11 and 180lbs 38D the XL fit perfect! Fitted in the arm and bust. Not tight through the middle. Very comfortable.
