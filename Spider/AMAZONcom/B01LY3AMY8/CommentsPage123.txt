Absolutely love this dress! It fits perfectly. Iâ€™m normally a 14-16 so I ordered the XL. Beautiful and well made.


Wow! This dress is a total bargain! Much more beautiful in person and the fabric is very soft not flimsy at all! Size is true to fit. Usually wear a 10/12 and purchased a Large not tight but not loose. Great find!!!


I love this dress! I was so scared to order this and it turned out awesome! I'm 5'7, a 36G and ordered a large. It for like a glove! My only complaint is that I wish the white was available.


Purchased this dress for a wedding. I loved the way it look and fit just right. I received a lot of compliments on it. :)


Beautiful dress!

This dress is just beautiful, just excellent quality!


I LOVE THIS DRESS! I read the reviews and ordered one size smaller and it fits great! (I'm 5'3" 125#) I usually order size medium but the small fits great. This is so flattering on every body type!


Fit very well and looks great; I can't wait to wear it out!


(For reference I got a small and I'm about 5'5, 140#)


Love the dress!! It is very flattering and fit perfectly
