I love the style of the dress however the sizing is at least 2 sizes smaller than listed.


Was hesitant to purchase this dress for a wedding having not tried it on prior, but I was pleasantly surprised ! It fits so well, is super cute, and is made well!


I wanted to love this dress but unfortunately it was pretty see through and not as expected.


Beautiful made dress at an affordable price. BTW - I normally wear a medium and the size fit as expected.


LOVE this dress, got a lot of compliments on it.  I thought it ran slightly small.  Ordered the red, beautiful color and fabric.


Super pretty, fits perfect and very feminine.  Well made...


Great dress. I love it


My only complaint is that the picture showed a solid skirt part but this is lace all the way. I loved wearing it, super comfortable and classy


Gorgeous, and very flattering!!! Comfortable and stretchy as well. Love this dress!!


This dress is beautiful, and fits perfectly! Looks exactly like the photo, and is a great quality!!! LOVE it!!!!
