I love it! Its a really soft and it lays nicely (I was worried about the top looking weird& the edges not staying flat). I'm 5'4-5'5 and the length is perfect(just below my knees). Its pretty stretchy. I ordered a small and might get the waist taken in a little, its good as is put I could easily get another 2in taken out and still be comfy. (My measurements are 35 26 37)


Used this for a Christmas show ballroom danced in.  Fit great and I looked great too.

My husband ordered this dress for me.  I ordered a large which I thought would fit well since I've loss about thirty pounds in the last year.  It fits, but will fit better when I lose another ten pounds or so.  The dress is beautiful, somewhat stretchy lace.  That's another reason to keep it.  But, it does run small, I'm wearing 10's and12s's lately and the large is a bit snug.


I absolutely LOVE this dress! It fits and looks exactly as described. It is a little on the heavier side; but when ordering online it is better that then it being paperthin! I love it and wear it often!


Very nice dress for the price. A bit bulkier in the waist than I might like, but good look overall.


This dress is so pretty! Iâ€™m 5â€™3 and 200lbs. The XL fit perfectly. I bought this dress in navy for a wedding and will need to get it hemmed from the bottom. The lace overlay hangs about 3 inches from the slip and looks a bit off. Other than that the lace is super stretchy so thereâ€™s plenty of give. Flattering for ALL sizes!


I love this dress. It fit great and I got so many compliments. I'm 5' and normally wear a size 16-18. Bought XXL.


I am a 8/10 and I wear this in a small.  It runs big but it is a gorgeous dress.


I had to return this. The flared skirt was REALLY flared and, although I really liked the way the top part of the dress looked and fit, the bottom half of the dress did not look good on me.
