I received so many compliments when I wore this dress.  The material was different than I expected, but it was comfortable and looked great.  I did have to steam out wrinkles before I wore it.


Beautiful dress! Fits perfectly! I normally wear size 14/16 so I ordered an XL


arms were a little tight  on this but cute dress


Simple yet very elegant!

Very pretty.  Terrific price for the quality!


Very fast shipping!  Ordered a small, and ended up returning for an extra small.  Refund took a couple days longer than I would have liked, but Iâ€™m an impatient person :P none the less, great dress and fits beautifully!
