The dress is very pretty . I found it about three inches too short in the waist line . I’m 5’5 1/2 , I’m sending it back


This dress is gorgeous. Got lots of compliments at the wedding I wore it to. Surprisingly comfortable, the lace wasn’t itchy or irritating at all and the fabric felt sturdy and not flimsy.
