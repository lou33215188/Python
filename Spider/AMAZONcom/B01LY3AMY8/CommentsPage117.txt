I am 5'4" & 120 lbs. and ordered an X-Small. I guess my shoulders are too narrow, because the sleeves don't stay up on me as pictured online! It's a great length (just below the knee), but I'll definitely have to get it tailored.


Love this dress. Very elegant. I have no bad feedback. Very happy with service and price.


Great dress, arrived quickly, fit is perfect. I gave 4 stars because the color is not as bright as the picture, it's a dark blue. However, it's a good color. I'm considering purchasing it in red for New Year's Eve.


Bought on a whim for the girls as a second dress for the wedding.  They loved them!  And many color choices.


Very true to fit. Good quality. Very comfortable.


I got so many compliments would defiantly recommend!


Perfect!! i love it!!


If you know and looking for a dress which is classy. Then this is it. The fabric, the style the fit. Just what carries and portrays that of a woman. Cant go wrong with this dress. classy to the T.


Very pretty dress, Fits as expected.Dress will need to be pressed, but that is expected when items are shipped. I will for sure order again from this company.


SO PERFECT!! The dress is more red and not the burgundy shown in the photo but from reading the reviews, I knew that. It is SO comfortable and fits in all the right places. I can't wait to wear it to my work Christmas party next month!
