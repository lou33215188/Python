I love this dress. I got so many compliments on the dress. It was very cute on!!


Very short waisted


The dress is beautiful. I can not believe the quality for this price. I am so happy with my purchase. It is true to size and will flatter all body types. I purchased a petticoat to give the skirt a more vintage look. I can't wait to see it all together. This dress exceeded my expectations!!


Super cute dress that fit perfectly. Wore it to my work Christmas party and got a ton of compliments.


Absolutely in love with this Dress! I'm 5'10" and a size 14 and it's perfectly long enough and classy and subtlety sexy all at the same time. The fabric is super soft and stretchy! Love love love it!


The quality of this dress is shockingly good. I really didnâ€™t expect that at all. It did run a little big though so I had to reorder in a smaller size.


I have never purchased a dress from Amazon but I carefully read all the reviews and purchased this dress and I LOVE it. Wearing it to a wedding at the end of November. The material is not cheap, fits great and I am happy with my purchase.


I have yet to wear the dress but it fits perfect
