Doesn't fit under the arms right for me because I have a long torso.


Measured first, using guide provided.  Fit perfect. Color true to image.  Good quality fabric and manufacturing.


Still trying to decide my thoughts on this one.


Love this dress! I'm going to wear it to my sons wedding. I usually where a size 12 to 14 dress. XL fit like a glove. Can't wait to wear it. Very flattering and made nicely.


Looks very stylish on!


The dress is just as pretty as the picture. It fits perfectly on me except the lenght was a bit longer than I expected because I orded an XL and I am pretty short. It still worked out and I got a lot of compliments on the dress.


Such a pretty dress.


Using this for a bridesmaid dress and love it!! The lace is comfortable and it is a swing dress! Can't wait to dance the night away in it


The dress fits so well and good quality too.


Love love love this dress!! Every time I go to a queens day they are in AWE! Super comfortable , can not complain at all!!
