Nice dress, fit well perfectly, great material. VERY long and did not fit on my short build, had to return it for that reason.


The dress is lovely it fits wonderful and you will be very happy with your purchase.  For bying without trying on I was skeptical but when I tried it on it fit perfectly. The material is very nice. I bought it to wear to a wedding. Very comfortable on also.


I absolutely loved the dress but not for short people sadly. I'm 5'1", and the description said above knee. It went mid calf on me. I also bought a small, and it was too large. Beautiful and would definitely recommend for someone taller/larger!


The waist was too high. It was at my rib cage.


Fit well, nicely made just wrong for the occasion.


Very pretty but a  1X fits like a 12...maybe 14.


Price is fair but it will be next year before I will fit in it.


The dress is beautiful.  I'm a 14 and the am glad I brought an XL.  It fits exact, no baggy or extra breathing room.  Glad I lost 5 pounds or else I would have to return the dress.


Love it!


I am 5'4 and weigh  around 130 and the small fit a little bit loose but looks great and it's about 2 inches past my knees.


Love this!! I never take time to write reviews but I wore this for an event this evening. I got so many compliments and was actually comfortable the entire evening. I would highly recommend this. Itâ€™s a good fit and everything is securely covered.
