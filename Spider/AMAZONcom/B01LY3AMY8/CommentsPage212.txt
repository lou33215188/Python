Beautiful dress! Soft lace and well made.  Normally wear a sz 6 and a small was perfect.  It shipped quickly and arrived right on time as well.  Thank you for a great buying experience.


It's exactly as expected. It fits perfectly. The material is excellent and comfortable. I'm planning to wear this to my graduation. Would recommend it to anyone.


Returned. Bought a large, 185 pounds, 5 10. Soft, but too young and tight for me.


I liked this dress, but then felt like I was wearing drapes after awhile. It's still a very nice dress. Looks just as the pictures show. I am 5' 4" & it went slightly below my knees


I wanted to give 5 stars to this dress because I loved it. The price was amazing, the fit, I really loved it.  With it being lace you have to be careful not to get it caugh on things. But I got complimented all night on it.


5â€™4 -197lbs. Size large.


I am a 5' 200 lb woman. I saw this dress and immediately  knew I wanted it. I figured I'd buy it and put it in my closet till i lost some weight. When it arrived I tried it on and was amazed it fit!  (the stretch helps a great deal)


It will look even better when I do lose 10 lbs but I am so very glad I made this purchase! don't hesitate ladies!


I'm 5'5" and 145Ib  and normally wear a medium in everything but after reading some of the ratings on here I got a small and it fit me perfectly.  This dress looks absolutely amazing and  off the shoulder stays up perfectly. I just recommend buying a size down from what you usually wear


Style was more for teenage or young adult and I wear a size 8 to 10 and was way too small


What a great buy. Fit was as expected.  Very elegant and well packaged. Didn't expect much but I was very happy with purchase.  So nice to get a good buy.


Very nice dress. Perfect material. Fit very well. I am buying other one for my mom :)
