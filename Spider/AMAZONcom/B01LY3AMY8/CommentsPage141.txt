Pretty dress.  I just have a long torso and an ample bustline causing the waistline to sit too high.  Wish I could have kept it.


This dress was absolutely beautiful and very comfortable. I wore it to a summer wedding and even with the long sleeves I didn't feel like I was overheating in it. I love it!


It got her fast and fit perfectly!  Couldnâ€™t have been better .


I loveeee this dress!! I am 5ft 9 and ordered a large it fit perfectly. I was concerned that it would be too short but it was a classy length. Definitely recommend!


It was perfect for the Christmas season.


The dress arrived quickly but was to big. I ordered according to measurements and it was way to long and loose.


Beautiful dress, great quality.


Its beautiful dress.


Sizing charts is designed for TALL chicks.


If your wife is 5' 2 it's a full length dress but it still looks good
