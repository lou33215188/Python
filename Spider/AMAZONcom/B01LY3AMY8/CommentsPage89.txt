Absolutely gorgeous dress, fit perfectly. Got numerous compliments.Shipped fast. Packaging was perfect in protecting dress. Wish they made full length ones.


I'm 5'1", around 125 lbs.  The small was a little large through my shoulders & chest.  It is well-made - beautiful.  Just not a good fit for me.


I bought this dress for Christmas and I was so excited to wear it. The color and dress is beautiful. I bought an xs since I normally wear size 0 jeans and small shirts well . .I put this on and it just slid right down to my feet. It's so big ); I'm sad now.


It looks good on me, just little static and sticks to my tights on the bottom


I tried the dress on as soon as I received it. It fitted as expected. Love it can't wait for an occasion to wear it.


The material is soft and the color is rich.  But the waist cuts too high for me. It will be returned.


I ended up returning this dress as I found it to be too baggy underneath the arms and the waist hit too high to be flattering. If you have a long torso, I think you'll run into the same issue I did with the waist. The dress does appear to be good quality. It's a cute dress; just not a good fit for my body.


Perfect fit, great fabric and looks exactly like the pictures.


The dress was a great fit. The design is very nice, simple and elegant! Nothing more to


say! Runs true to your size...you will love the way it feels and look on you!


I am a size 22 in jeans and 2x to 3x in shirts and this dress fit me perfectly
