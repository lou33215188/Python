I can't believe the excellent quality for price.  Wearing to semi-formal affair


This dress is so flattering and elegant. I got so many compliments.


Love this dress! What a classy hit!!


This is an absolutely beautiful dress. It is so comfortable and fun to wear.


The color was more of a red then maroon


I purchased this as a bridesmaid dress for my wedding. It is perfect. Looks just like the picture and fit my daughter perfectly.


Fabric and lace is very soft and comfortable. The dress was true to size.


Blew away expectations!


Extremely comfortable and cute. I wish I would've bought a small instead though. I'm 5'5" and around 130.


Great
