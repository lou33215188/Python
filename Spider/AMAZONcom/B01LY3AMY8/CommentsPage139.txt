Pretty dress. True to size. Just not my style.


I love this dress!


Very beautiful romantic feminine and a little sexy!  Only remark I have is it doesn't have a true waist--seam hits higher but not quite empire. Pretty on tho


Excellent!! Just like on the picture except it’s about 3/4 sleeves not long sleeves like on the model


The dress is beautiful perfectly right on me. Hug as my curves. Material is not itching. I just love the dress


Beautiful  dress, and  comfortable.


I like it but it’s a little long and I’m 5’10.


Beautiful, very good quality and fits perfect!! Love it!


too large and Not fit at all. Seller's behave is very weird.
