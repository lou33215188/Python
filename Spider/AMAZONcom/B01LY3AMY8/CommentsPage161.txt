This dress is so beautiful! It was better than I expected!


I really loved this dress. But being so busty on the top and the waist is too high made my hips look too  big.


I'm 5'2 and 165 pounds, I was expecting it to be just a bit snugger but a medium probably would have been just too tight to zip up.


I think I stole some of the bride's spotlight when I wore this beautiful dress.  Fix exactly as expected and was so comfortable.  I've never received so many compliments in my life!  What a bargain!
