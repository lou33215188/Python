Bought this to wear to an afternoon wedding.  Just lovely!  Typically I wear a L but based upon the size chart I went with the M.  So glad that I did because I am not top heavy (whatsoever) and the whole thing just fit me perfectly.  It is truly a stunner and looks so much more expensive than it actually costs.  A wonderful buy!


These dresses fit so well and are BEAUTIFUL! The pictures don't do them justice. The A-Line of the dress fits so well with us curvy ladies! Highly recommend! We bought 8 of these for a wedding party with women all different shapes and sizes and they worked perfectly.


This dress was amazing! I wore it for an event that my husband and I went to and received many compliments. Iâ€™m a size 16/18 and the XL fit perfectly! Very stunning dress.


This dress is beautiful.The color red is dark and rich. The lace is soft and comfortable. I am 5' and this dress goes to my knees. I don't care for it being that long, just a warning for those of you who are on the short side.


I can't think of anything to say other than just buy it! It fits great and is so comfortable! I'm 5' 4", 170lbs and got a Large! Hope this helps!


Doesn't fit snugly enough to remotely look like image.


Iâ€™ve been using large sizes but I got a medium , Iâ€™m 5â€™2 with gymnast shoulders and back so that was perfect ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�½. I couldâ€™ve easily fit a small and it wouldâ€™ve been a bit more fitted but I prefer to not feel like I am choking . Material is great honestly and it looks very elegant in black. Iâ€™d definitely get the blue one too ! Itâ€™s goes a little longer in me but still is great


I should have ordered Medium instead of the Small.  I based my order on other reviews.  I will re-order in Medium as I really like the dress; how it looks and the cut/style.  I'm usually an 8 in dresses...and this fits more like a 6.  It has lots of stretch but really is too short-waist ed to look perfect.


I was super excited to get this dress to try it for homecoming, but when I got it, it wasn't what I expected. I'm 5"4' and 110 lbs. I ordered an extra small and it was still too big. It was very baggy and it was slightly itchy. I felt it looked too much like something a grandma would wear. Also, the red in the picture looks way darker than it actually comes in. I was pretty disappointed with it.


Love love love!! It came just in time for the wedding I was attending! Iâ€™m usually super skeptical about buying stuff online expeciallly dresses cause Iâ€™m a plus size but this fits so perfect for me so in love!
