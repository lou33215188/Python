Bought a collection of dresses for Mother's Day. This was the only one that fit perfect. The fabric is thick, but light enough - especially in Vegas weather. The tank portion where the armpit is, is comfortable - it doesn't snug awkwardly. Overall the dress was a success. I'm thinking of getting more colors.


For reference I am 5'3" and 120lbs. I have a small waist and a large butt. This dress is very flattering on my figure. I was looking for a dress to wear to the Kentucky Derby and this is definitely a contender! This dress is versatile, can be dressed up or down, very soft and comfortable as well. Sorry, I can't figure out how to get my picture the right way up!


I'm posting so as to help others like me who may be struggling to decide which buyer to get a dress from since they all look the same!


After reading the comments of each product, I decided to go with an Acevog since they had a size chart and the colors looked softer in photos.


When I got it though, I was torn between returning it for a smaller size or trying to alter it since the top was so boxy looking. The material is so soft and it was a beautiful print but it just hung off of me and the "sleeves" were a strange cut.


Ultimately I decided to order a Tom's ware dress because I had read a comparison review that said it was more form fitting than the Acevog. I ordered it a size smaller and although it's a little shorter than I usually wear, it fits me much better and is the look I wanted. The straps are more proportionate which is much more flattering as well. Maybe the smaller size Acevog would have had thinner straps that looked better but I'm going to stick with the Tom's wear. Unless someone can confirm that for me! The Tom's ware isn't as soft since it has a different material backing the inside than the Acevog, but it is still very comfortable. The Acevog did feel more luxurious against the skin so I would have loved to have that in a more form fitting style. Maybe I will order it in a size smaller to compare.


And for help sizing, I'm 5'11 size 16 to 18 jeans and a 40 G.


It fits really nice and the material is soft


LOVE this dress. I bought it for a country concert and I wore with cowboy boots. Got so many compliments on the fit and color. The dress material is thicker and supporting so it doesn't show every flaw. I'm 5'5" 135lbs and generally wear a dress size 6-8 and I ordered a medium. Would definitely order again or in another pattern!!


I'm always afraid to buy clothes online but I took my measurments and chose the dress and left it to fate. I absolutely LOVE this dress. It fits perfectly. The material is stretchy and almost a bit silky a tad. Its the perfect length too. Not too long or too short. The colors are gorgeous. All in all 10/10. Thinking of buying again in different colors ğŸ˜�


Very cute and flattering. Got it for my daughter as part of a cosplay outfit but it is comfortable and casual for every day.


Cheap, terrible, itchy, stiff fabric, like clothes from the dollar store. The dress was too short and I'm only 5'3. I have tunics that are longer. The dress's fit was just off, too tight in the chest but big under the arms. The pattern was pretty and the dress would have been great in a nicer fabric & cut.for reference I'm 180, 36DD & bought a XL.


I ordered a Large, I'm 5'6, 147lbs, 34G. It fit perfectly. The material is a bit on the thick side but it's not horribly overheating, so far, and I live in Texas. I wore this on vacation in Puerto Rico as well and didn't feel the dress made me warmer by just wearing it. In fact, it weighs just enough to not fly up and expose the lady bits in a wind gust. It hangs nicely, it's comfortable, the length is perfect - right above my knee, and I'd buy more in other colors.


Nice lightweight dress for summer and under cardigans. Very flattering. Hides my tummy and makes the girls look good. Very stretchy and runs big. I am a 16, 38D, the XL is just right.  XXL very roomy but hangs nicely. The thing about this dress is the shoulder straps are very long. I want the dress to be shorter to show off my legs (it comes right to the top of my knees at 5'8" tall)' so I am going to fold the straps at the top and sew them up about 2". This will bring up the skirt where I want it, and raise up the scoop neck which is low. Should be perfect then.
