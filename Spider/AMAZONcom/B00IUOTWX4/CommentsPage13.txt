Super cute dress for the price. The material has some stretch to it and is a bit thicker so it lays really nice. I did notice after wearing a cross body purse for an entire afternoon, the material on my hip where the purse rubbed started to pill. Not too noticeable with the pattern but I will probably not machine wash it and opt for dry cleaning instead to avoid pilling.


This dress is perfect. It looks absolutely fantastic, especially with a thin waist belt (I bought 


 to go with it) sitting right at the seam in the middle. I know how helpful details are when you are buying clothes on Amazon, so here are my personal dimensions: I am 5'3" and I weigh about 120lbs. My waist is 26.5 inches and my bust is 32D or 34C. If you are a tiny bit bigger than this, the dress will likely still look fantastic in the size small, as the bust area is not too tight, and could be tighter on me with no problem. However, it looks perfect just the way it is on me. I highly recommend it!


Omg !! I wish I purchased one more !! The black floral caught my eyes because of how vibrant the colors especially the pink since its my favorite color . I m so glad I went with my gut literally. If u are about 5'6 185 and don't like your clothes too tight  and have a pouch get the XL . I like my clothes to fit comfortably and a L would have been too tight around the stomach .Perfect size perfect dress. It is a little thicker than most summer dresses however, it's always freezing in my office in the summer so it's fine along with a cardigan. I m plan on wearing it with a chocker, and my black suede peep toe sandals I can't wait to wear it!! Its getting so close to really hot weather ğŸ™ŒğŸ™ŒğŸ™Œ. Get this dress ! FashionistasğŸ˜�


This is my second dress from this brand and I am not disappointed. They are awesome! In particular, I like that this dress is a thick material so it's very flattering. I am 5'5", 145lb, athletic build, 34D, and typically where a size 4-6 dress. I ordered the medium and it fit perfectly. It is tight around my chest and falls fitted (but not too tight) at my waist and then has a pretty flare that isn't exaggerated. It lands about 1.5 inches about my knee and I like that as well because it's provided good coverage but still looks fashionable in my opinion.


Wow. I saw the previous reviews and was hopeful but skeptical that this dress would work out. This is seriously such a magical dress. Think sisterhood of the traveling pants but for a dress. It's beautiful and flatters in all the right places!!!


Definitely size up, it's a bit on the small size. I ordered a large, although I usually wear a medium in women's (large in juniors). The material is a perfect medium thickness. It covers and is not sheer or clingy (two things I hate about dresses), but is light enough that you won't be sweating in it (could be a summer dress or you could pair with some leggings). It also manages to accentuate your bust and bottom and somehow hide your tummy area!! I am a recent mom who has the mama bulge, and this dress is the first time I feel sexy--it totally creates the illusion like I got a flat tummy! How????? I have no idea, but I just bought this dress in other colors. Also, I typically worry about the underarm bulge, but this dress is cut high enough that there is no overhang! Hooray! Also this is a slip on, so no zipper to worry about.


If you are a somewhat to totally curvy woman, got some extra pounds, or just had a baby, this dress is the dress for you. I'm sure it'll work for you even if you aren't those things, but for a woman who has those, this dress is a dream come true.


This dress must be meant for shorter people or for youth, as the dress was very short and small fitting.  I read all the reviews and most said that the dress ran true to size.  I'm 5'7" and 138 lbs and wear a size 8 so I ordered a medium.  Received the dress and the Medium fits small.  I looked at the dress a few times before trying it on, thinking that they must have sent me a small rather than a medium, but nope, the label says medium.  The dress was very tight and very short! I felt if I bent over too much I would be showing everything!  I'm tempted to buy the large though and try it out as I love the pattern so much.


This is a nice dress.  I ordered a medium and I should have gotten the size large.  I am a solid 12 in sizes and can border 10/12 in tops. 5"8' 155 pounds B cup. I have a long torso.  It was a bit tight across the chest and rode up just a bit only because it was too small.  I re-ordered the navy floral in a large.  I can share the size medium dress with my niece who is just a bit smaller than me.  Lucky girl because the dress is fantastic.  No sheerness issues and very comfy.  The pattern looked a bit frumpy on the website but l loved it in person.


I've previously raved about Tom's other products: (the assymetrical zip hoodies,) but I have to extend more kudos to Tom's for these easy, pretty sundresses! Sizing: I'm 5'10, & the XL is a perfect fit. Tom's research & design team deserve praise for consistently producing flattering items. I have 3 of these swingy dresses. The cut is complimentary & in styling any one of the 3, I feel elegant, put together, & sexy. Yesss! Tom's does it again. Note: the dress is described as " green," although the actual hue is more in the aqua marine family.


I absolutely LOVE this dress! I'm 5'3 and I usually wear a size 16. I got the XXL just to be safe but it ended up being a bit too long. It went right to my knees. I fixed  the dress a bit to where I want the length to be, before I took photo. I'm just going to hem it up a bit myself instead of sending it back. I plan to order more dresses but I'll probably go with just a large or xl next time :)


Edit: I added a second photo of me wearing a size Large instead of xxl. The large fit PERFECT! I love it and I will be ordering more in ALL the colors!!!! ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


Love the fabric, love the style and it fits great! For reference, I'm 5'2", 160lbs, 38D and the large fits nice. I still have a mommy tummy 18 months post partum and this dress flares out just right to distract away from it while nicely, yet still modestly, accentuating my bust and waist. It falls just above my knees and is going to be great for work this summer!
