The dress that arrived was not even close to what I ordered.


Exactly what I had hoped it would be! Fit perfect! I'm 5'2 130 lbs and I ordered a med and it fits like it was made for me. Love this dress!


Very classy dress - I am 5'3" and the hem hits where my knee ends. The lace is beautiful.


Not as I expected.  Want to return it


I love the dress. I usually wear 8/10 and i bought large based on some reviews and it fitted perfectly. Got many compliments from my friends.


Gonna be beautiful for my daughters wedding in october!!


dress arrived more than a week late, but my daughter does like it (though it is a bit on the shorter side) & she will have to wear something underneath.


Love this dress, the lace doesn't have much give, but I'm keeping and going to lose a few pounds before I wear it to the wedding.


beautiful dress. I am 5'2 and 140 lb. I ordered medium and it fits perfectly


Beautiful! Ordered it for homecoming. Reasonably priced and looked super nice  :)
