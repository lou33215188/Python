Fit too small, the tucks/puckers in the front and back are pretty big so it doesn't lay flat and poofs out. The hem was very crooked, too long in front/short in back. The zipper was really sticky.


Although, I did not keep the dress, it had nothing to do with the fit , material, workmanship.  Unfortunately, I purchased 7 different dresses and I ended up choosing to wear something a little more revealing/relaxed. But this was beautiful and fit just as pictured. If I had enough different occasions to where this type of dress I would have kept it.


Cheap, had strings hanging from the dress when it arrived. Zipper wasn't very easy either.


Just a little loose on the top but comfy and light, well put together. I can zip it up all by myself!


Lovely dress but the arms are very very tight.  Does not fit US standard sizes.


So my mom was going through my amazon and came across this dress. She was a bit skeptical about the sleeves in particular but nonetheless she wanted it. She received the dress and she was amazed by how it fits. She loved it! Only reason why I'm giving it four stars is because the bottom fits a bit too wide for her liking. But it can be fixed! Overall I personally love it


Cute dress. Just a lot longer than expected. I'm 5'2"& I need to get hemmed.


Good quality for the price. Fit as expected. Some reviews said the fabric is see through but I wore it without anything underneath (except a bra on top) and I had no issue.


I just wore this dress to a wedding and it was really nice and fit great. I’m 5’3 28” waist and 36 DD bust. I bought the large and it fits great.


Beautiful.


Excellent quality.


Looks exactly as shown in the picture here.
