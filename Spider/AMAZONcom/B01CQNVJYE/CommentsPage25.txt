Very lovely dress. Do look at the size chart. I'm 5'6", 155 and normally take a medium or size 10.


Had to size up, glad that I did. It fit well. Did have to tack the seam on side zipper, so it would close.open easier.


I am 175 lbs, 5'7 and tend to be a little wide in the back, with 36B. I purchased the XL and it fit just right.  A little snug below the bust. The quality was well worth it!


I wore this to a wedding, it was super comfy and still very elegant. I danced and had a great time without feeling uncomfortable at all. I also liked that I was able to carry children without poky decorations all over like some other dresses.


I absolutely loved it!! Beautiful dress!! I am 5'4 and 167 pounds, the Large fits perfect!! I can't wait to wear it.


Not really red and purple but red and dark navy. It was a very pretty dress.


Perfect length and the color looks the same as the online picture. If you have big arms buy a bigger size and get sides taken in. It's a very comfortable dress the neck is cut well and the inner lining feels good on the skin


This was actually purchased for a dance for my fourteen-year-old daughter -- her choice. We purchased a Medium for her and it fit her like a glove. It was a very lovely design and well made. She felt very pretty in this and received loads of compliments.


Purchased a larger size and it was still too small across the bust.  Material is scratchy as well.


I love this dress.  I'm always hesitant to order dresses online, but this fits perfectly.  I am 5'8", 140lbs and I ordered a Medium.  I have 2 weddings next month and cant wait to wear this new dress!


Looked all right. I returned it because I'm pretty well endowed and I don't think the high neck line did anything flattery for me. I probably got it a size too big as well so it looked a little sloppy.
