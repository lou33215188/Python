Super Cute Dress with Perfect Fit. I am 5'2 and bought a Medium Size.


Great fit however the fabric pulls easily


I am 5’2”, 110lb, 33-24-35 and ordered the black and purple version of this dress in size small based on the other reviewers’ comments, but it was absolutely HUGE on me. Girls, you let me down! The dress was so gorgeous, though, that I almost kept it in order to have it completely and totally altered to fit my apparently tiny frame, but that would have cost twice as much as what I paid for the dress since the tailors would have to deal with both the lace and the lining. I’m a huge fan of this amazing dress, so if Amazon ever offers an extra-small or extra-extra small, I’m definitely coming back for it!


I love it! It looks amazing!


Perfect I love it n my spouse love it aaslo so that's what makes me even happier


This dress would've been pretty cute, but it was too short. It was an awkward length and made me look short (I'm 5'9" and am mostly legs, so that's hard to do). It made my boobs look great, and the low back was really cute. But it was just really unflattering height-wise and hit me at an awkward place above the knee.  Sadly, I had to return it because I would always be self-conscious that it was making my legs look short and stubby.  If you have short legs, it would probably look great! It was true to the size listed in the description.
