After reading all the great reviews, I was excited to get it. I ordered by following the seller's size chart & going by my bust measurement. It fit perfectly but made me look frumpy, dowdy, & way older. The material (the black & purple lace combination) is beautiful but that's it. No way I could ever wear it. Sorry but not for me.Sent back the next day.


Thankfully based on other reviewers, I got an XL (usually wear 12/14) and it was basically a perfect fit.  The ribbon in the middle is sewed in (front and back) with two straps hanging on the side you can tie.  I found the sewed in ribbon wasn't in the perfect place and to me looks a bit awkward, but not a big deal.  I'm going to try the other style of this dress to see if it looks better.  It does seem like a really nice dress if I liked the placement of the ribbon.


I love it ğŸ˜� I buy it for my birthday party's and looks very nice.


This dress is beautiful, lots of great compliments. I order a X-L Iâ€™m a size 14.


I love this dress.  I normally wear a 12/14 in U.S. sizes and I was torn between ordering an XL and XXL (my natural waist is 35" and chest is 34).  I went with the XL and it fits perfect.  I'm 5'4" and the hem comes just below my knee.  I think the shape is flattering and the black satin belt helps define the smallest part of the waist.  I think this dress would look really good with a black petticoat but is also cute without for a more simple look.  I will likely buy more Miusol dresses now that I know what size I wear and have seen the quality of this brand.


I bought this dress for a wedding. It worked out perfectly. I'm 36D which might explain why the middle section of the dress was a bit high and dig into my ribs just a bit. It wasn't a big problem. I have big arms and this dress hid that. I loved the fact that the dress had the big bottom. Overall, this dress complimented my curvy body.


I loveeeee this dress. I purchased it for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Iâ€™m approx 5â€™8 and it fight perfect around the waist and was the perfect length. The dress itself is beautiful and appears much more expensive. I will definitely wear this dress again, itâ€™s also well made


I got this dress in black and wow!!!  My friends thought i spent a lot of money for this dress. I had to go up two sizes. To the makers of these dresses, please start making these dresses in American sizes. Thanks!!


Beautiful, I ordered 1 size larger and it is perfect. Nicely made and very beautiful, covers half knee and nice flow to skirt. Would order again, and recommend. Great cocktail party or special occassion dress.


This dress is actually very well made. It is lined and for the price I paid that in itself is extraordinary. The color is great. Two issues-the ribbon has to be detached and redone to look anything like the picture and the top is way too tight. I am not hugely busty and I ordered a XXL because of this same complaint  but this dress squished me up top a lot. I am wearing it one night for about 5 hours....hope I can breathe all that time!!
