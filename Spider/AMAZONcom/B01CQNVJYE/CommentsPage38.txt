Nice dress, beautiful color, great fabric, fully lined with a self belt. Only complaint is that I must've gotten a defective item bc my zipper was stuck right out of the package.


This dress fits great. I'm wearing it to a wedding this week and am excited about it. I feel very comfortable in it.


The waist didn't hit me in the right spot, was a little baggy. I ordered a small 5'8", 120 lb. Wish it would have fit, it is a cute dress.


My wife looks cute in everything. But this dress complements her very nicely. It is well made and it seems that it will work most of the year, excepting the heat of summer.


Fit like a glove. What you see is what you get the color is the same as you see on the images. I followed the measurement/size chart. Normally I wear size 12 dresses and large at bust. I ordered a size xl.


It is a little tight in the arms but the fit is really good. (I'm a bigger girl 5'4" and 190Lbs) ordered xl and fit otherwise is perfect


It is a pretty dress, but runs at least 1 size small. One of the reviewers said to go up a size & according to the size chart I should have been able to wear a small as my bust is only 35", but I did order a Med & it is very snug. The zipper is really hard to zip as well, could hardly unzip it on the hanger to try it on!!!


Over all it was very pretty dress, and good quality. But it was made to small for the shoulders and chest area. And therefor didnâ€™t fit me quite right so I had to return it. If you have a smaller chest and not to broad of shoulders though I imagine it would fit quite nicely !


I wore this to an important work event and got SO many compliments! Such a great dress, especially for the price.


Fit was perfect, I get a size up because I have a bigger chest. I didn't like how it looked though, because of the high neckline my chest looked even bigger.
