I love it! The arm holes are a little tight but not bad and the colors are just as I expected!


Bought for my wife and it was just perfect and she also loved it and looked gorgeous in t j is outfit...


Love the dress!  I got lots of compliments.  My first time ordering a dress and not familiar with the label.  I was very pleased and impressed.  I will order this brand again in the future.


The dress fits perfectly and is good quality. Canâ€™t wait to wear to a wedding in November.


Very beautiful and classy.


Received a lot of compliments.  Dress looks amazing with or without a petticoat.


Great dress! Fits perfectly!


Nice


good price- would love if it was an inch or two shorter. I'm 5' 3" and comes below the knee.


Beautiful dress
