Disappointed that there is no purple in this, only red and navy blue. The quality was far superior to what I've experienced most places on Amazon, but I'm returning because it's just not a great fit for me. I have a longer torso and usually end up somewhere between "tall" and "regular" sizes. The length of this dress is perfect, but the ribbon at the waistline sits too far up on my torso and looks more "empire" style. There's a little give & stretch in the fabric so I can pull it down to the right place, but then the armholes are too long and gape awkwardly.For reference I am 5'7" and 118 lbs. The fit was true to size (based on measurements) and the small was great for me (comfortable but not too tight or loose) except for the length of the torso.


Fit absolutely perfect!  Loved this dress.


Fit is exactly as described.  Color is beautiful.  Made well.
