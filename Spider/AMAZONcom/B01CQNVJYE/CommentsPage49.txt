I love this dress! Great quality! It was the first dress I purchased on Amazon; what made me feel comfortable buying this were all the helpful reviews!  I'm glad I went one size up because the dress fits me perfectly. The dress fits very comfortably all while looking all dressed up! As a woman you have to appreciate that!


Dress is brightly colored. I was looking for a darker dress, so I returned, but it fit well and was nicely made.


I bought 1 size up XL for this dress and it fit perfect. I am size 14. It looks like a pricey dress. Happy with my purchase


Very small in the armpits had to return it. But loved the color, style and material.


Soft fabric, flattering and fits nicely. I usually wear medium size, ordered a large.


I bought this dress for my 13-year-old daughter and both she and I are thrilled. She's 5'6" and it falls just above her knee. It's a flattering cut and looks classy. It covers everything it should without looking stuffy. Neither she nor I like shopping, so to find something online that arrived in two days and fit as nicely as this dress does was a gift.


Beautiful dress! Good quality. I am 5'2'' and size small falls just under my knees.


Nice dress for the price, good fit but did not look good on me so I returned it.


Great dress for $30!! Same quality you'd find at Macy's for 3x that. I thought it ran a tad small. Recommended to friends.


Wasnt sure if it would look too plain. But ended up really nice. Good material, well sewed. Versatile dress to wear for different occasions
