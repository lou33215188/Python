Nice dress for the money and comfortable


Very nice color as you expected from the the picture. The delivery was on time. Good stuff for low price!


My mother loved it


I liked the colors but the dress is too small I wear a size 12 to 14 and ordered extra large thinking it would fit. It did not.


I love my dress it fits perfectly. I usually wear size M, but after reading the size chart, I ordered a Large and it is lovely.


Didn't look anything like the picture


Very pretty feminine look without being toooo dressy. Great for formal or cocktail events.


Beautiful dress, but it is not frilly as shown in the picture. Also, Miusol needs to come up with different color options. It's usually blue or red.


Perfect designed and size as expected. Love it so much. Will order another design in the future


Love this dress. Looks very elegant, just great for the holidays.
