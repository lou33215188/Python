Bought this for my wife for a wedding. Fit perfect! Maybe a little tight but that's not the makers fault.

Super elagent ! Must buy


Love this dress! My only complaint is that the arm wholes are made for the size of a small child! I am 5'4, 175 Lbs, 36DD and I ordered an XL. My arms seriously hurt, they were that small. :(


Love this dress! Purchased for an upcoming fall wedding - it is gorgeous and appropriate for the occasion.  I am a size 12/14 and the XL fit well.  A little loose in the waist but as I carry a lot of my weight in the chest/hips a comfy fit.


This is my 2nd dress by this brand and the quality and fit are consistent  - will be my go to source for a comfy, attractive special ocassion dress at a very good price!


This designer runs small but it was just not what I was hoping for. Pretty dress but maybe to young for me! Returned.


Darling, super great, I'm wearing it to a wedding next month.  It's totally reversible and totally beautiful both ways.


This dress is super cute and it's easy to wash, just don't dry it.


I got a medium, I am 5 8 and normally wear size 8/10. It fit pretty well.


You may need to go a size up if you have a large bust.


I bought this for a wedding but the fabric is a bit heavy for warmer weather and I did not think the neckline looked flattering on me


Size is a little off.  I used the sizing chart to make my purchase, but it is still a little too small.  I like the dress and am hoping to lose weight so I can fit into it.


The chest ares is very small if you have a large chest this my not it. I had to return it because of the chest area however this is made very well the fabric is great I would recommend the dress just buy a size up.
