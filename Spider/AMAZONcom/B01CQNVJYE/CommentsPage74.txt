I didn't like this dress so much on me but it is cute.


Just right for my daughter.


Dress was pretty. Seems well made but did not fit. I purchased based on the size chart and it was too small. I am a true 14 and a Large in most clothes. I'm thinking this was more of a 10/12 and not a 12/14 dress. I really wanted to order an XL to compare but the dress is not available in the Black/Purple color I was looking for. Hopefully it will be soon so I can buy it again. The reason for the low score is strictly on size, the dress is well crafted otherwise.


Very cute and true to size!


I'm 5'8 so it's hard to find a dress that's appropriate for me to wear at work....the length is perfect and it's great quality I'm going to buy the other color I love it so much.


just as described. Well sewn. fit's great! sooo comfortable- material  has just the right 'give' without being too stretchy~ love it!


Not very comfortable.


I have found a new favorite source for beautiful dresses!! I absolutely love this dress, it fits perfectly, and it's modest. Absolutely perfect! I will definitely be recommending them to my friends.


Beautiful dress!  Got many compliments!  Wore it to a wedding-perfect!  Great quality!  Awesome price too!


It looks amazing. Very good quality of the fabric. Looks pretty classy
