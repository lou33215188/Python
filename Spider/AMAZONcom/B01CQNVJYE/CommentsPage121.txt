Lov it


Great price, good fit!


This dress is really good quality, especially for such an affordable price. The colors, designs, and material are all as pictured, EXCEPT the sash is sewed on to tie in the back, not on the side as shown which is kind of a bummer and the skirt is longer (but I am rather short). It wasn't as flattering as I'd hoped, and the sleeves and collar are somewhat confining. I am 5'3", 125lbs, and usually a dress size 8-10. I got a medium and it's a little tight on top, but not too bad. Overall, it's a keeper, but I'm not ordering this one in any other colors.


Size is not accurate
