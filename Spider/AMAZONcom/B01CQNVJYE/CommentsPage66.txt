Runs large...pretty dress. I wear a size 4 and this was roomy. I am a size 30DD bust and this dress was fine in the bust area. Sleeves were wide, armhole is pretty big.


Very pretty dress! I love the comfort and it looks very feminine and modest.


Just perfect!! Love the color, size, quality, everything. Would have been happier if the price was a bit lower though.


Pretty dress. It was just not my style.
