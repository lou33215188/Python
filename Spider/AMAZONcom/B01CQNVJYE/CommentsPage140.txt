Beautiful dress, lovely material, just runs small. The ribbon is non-detachable and sits a little higher on the waist than appears in the picture.

This dress was perfect! I went off the measurement chart for sizing. It's a very flattering cut and the fabric is great. I wore this for a company event and felt fantastic. Gots lots of compliments.


This dress is so perfect!!!


I thought this dress was going to be so cute.  I typically wear a large but I ordered an XL since a few of the reviews said that it was tight in the arms, which is a common problem for me.  So the dress came and it was way too small.  I couldn't even get it over my shoulders.  The fabric is stiff and awkward without any give.  But I still wanted to get the dress, so I returned it and ordered an XXL.  The new dress came and it's STILL too small.  It's cut very awkwardly where there's extra fabric under the arms that is pulling down.  Some of these reviews say there's a zipper, but the dresses I had did not have a zipper.  I'm not sure how this dress has so many five star reviews.


Love love love this dress! I got so many compliments on it and it was comfortable to wear all night. Fits true to size. I'm 5'3 and weigh 160 and got a large and it fit perfect.


Good quality dress. I'm a 4 normally and ordered the small, which fit perfectly. I didn't, however, like the style. The neckline was closer to my neck than anticipated, and the hemline longer. Overall a very pretty dress, just not for me.
