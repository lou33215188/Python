I ordered large and it was a little tight but it's a good dress


loved fit and style


wish it came in different, lighter colors


Such a beautiful dress!  Quality, thick material and very flattering!


Tight on the waist


Stunning! Got lots of complements.


Beautiful dress but seem small for the size. Had to return it!


the care instructions are not clear


Liked it a lot


Very pretty, good quality and great price


Have a bit of a problem with zipper. It need a hole so I can thread a ribbon to use to zip
