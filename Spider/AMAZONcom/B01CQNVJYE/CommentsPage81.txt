The dress is very beautiful for the price! I bought the dress for my sister, I just tried on it: I wear size M and I'm 5'1'' - size M fitted me, the dress is too long for me (I knew about it, just for information), and the arm holes are a little tight but not bad.


Wore this to a fancy event and felt so confident and recieved so many compliments on it! Way more than i expected for the price!


Does not look like picture straight dress not fitted around waist like picture


Nice material but higher cut than in the model and a little larger than I would have liked


Very good dress.  The quality is wonderful as well. Bought this dress for a wedding. love it


I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this dress and the workmanship for such a reasonable price and because I couldn't touch it before purchasing. I have a semi formal event to wear it to and am very excited!


I bought this dress as well as another for my first Amazon clothing purchase. I loved the fit and the look of this dress, the fabric didn't look or feel cheap.


Fits nicely.


Perfect Summer Cocktail Dress ! Nice, easy and flattering fit .  Cap sleeves and sash , give the dress just enough finish . Colors are fantastic ! This dress could easily be accessorized for a night out.


Great quality clothing that fits as expected. Looks very pretty and not a cheap looking garment.


I rarely write reviews, but this dress just wowed me enough! Looks very flattering
