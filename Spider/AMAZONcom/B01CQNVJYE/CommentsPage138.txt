Perfect fit! Super cute. Nice quality.


Very beautiful dress!


It's look gorgeous


Thought it would be too large but fit perfectly. Fabric is soft and doesn't seem cheap. Colors are true to photo. Love this!


I like the dress but it is a little small. Not sure if I will be able to use.


I love this dress.  It's so pretty and the fit is so flattering.  It's so nice to find clothes that are true to size.  I generally wear a large and I get frustrated when I have to get something in XL XXL or even triple XXXL because sizes run small at a lot of stores.  I also have broad shoulders which can be a problem with dresses.  But not with this one.  I love it!


A bit short but not bad looking


Too tight at breasts which made the tie right under breasts instead of waist.


It is beautiful and nice quality.


Great product, really pretty, fit & appeared just as expected


Runs smaller than expected but it's a pretty dress
