Exactly what I was expecting. Conservative stylish dress that's appropriate for work and church. I'm a thicker curvy momma of 3. My measurements are 42/32/42 I ordered the XXL and it fits perfect! I would normally buy an XL but I'm glad I picked up the XXL. If you like a more snug fit just order your exact size.


Initially I ordered a large in this dress, when I tried it on, I had 3-4 inches of extra fabric around my waistline. So I ordered the medium to replace it, and the medium is tight in the top across the shoulders and chest. I always have issues with tops fitting my shoulders, so having it tight across my shoulder is nothing new, but the lace is strong and even when it feels like I might be close to ripping some of it, it stays strong and intact. The dress doesn't quite sit as low on me as it does on the model, the three bands are appear a bit move above my waist, but it still looks cute.


I'm going to stick with the medium because I'd rather it be a bit tight, than 3-4 inches too large. I'm 5'11" and usually wear a medium in shirts, and 8-10(29-30) in jeans.


Beautiful modest dress option that my teen daughter picked out herself for her 8th grade graduation and she still wears it and loves it nearly a year later. Stylish enough for her and covers enough for me to be comfortable with it as a parent. NOTE: There is a fairly open back on it, but she has very long hair so she either wears her hair down or wears a light sweater so she feels comfortable in it.


It was very heavy and it made me look like a house.  The bow is not fixed on the front like the picture.  You have to put it where you would like it and hope that it holds.  I really wish it would have worked out.


I am a 12/14 and I ordered the large purple/black dress.  I could not zip it up!  I returned it and got the XL.  I could zip it up, but it was very tight on me.  I returned it just now and ordered the XXL.  I'm sure it will be just right.  It is a beautiful dress.  It runs small - I am not a 2X, but that is the size that I will end up wearing in this dress!


I'm typically not a big fan of dresses but this one is a home run. Being tall and long legged I often run into dresses being to short or having to get a long dress but this is perfect in length. Can be dressed up for formal occasions or worn casually to a dinner or outing. The lace sleeves are high quality and don't have little threads hanging off. Only down fall is the zipper is a little finicky so zipping it alone can be a challenge. Otherwise it's a perfect product.


Nice dress, good quality. Great mix of casual and a little dressy. I love that is has a little color to it, without being too flashy.


I bought this dress in Navy Blue for my sister in laws wedding. I tried it on as soon as it showed up at my door step and it fit perfectly. I got so many compliments from family and friends. The material and dress is well made. I recommend you buy this dress. Can't wait to wear again! ğŸ˜�


Great dress. Red and blue dress definitely gives off a purple affect. Flattering fit and comfortable. Its just fun to wear. Great price point.


It was pretty good. Fabric was pretty and good quality. However the cut wasn't ideal for my body. I needed more of a fit and flair with a lower waist, maybe a v for my chest. The fabric was a bit tight and especially on my chest which is, admittedly, abnormally large. I sent this back and wore a dress I already had to the party. Overall, good quality, pretty dress. I was impressed at what $30 could get me on Amazon. I will try other styles of dress from this same brand.
