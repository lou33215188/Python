Very pretty dress, fits about right, I think I'll wear it to church tomorrow.


In the Bust are debating in to give it as a present.


The dress was way too small. Can I have a refund because the sizing was way off?


I bought a size 14 which xxl in plus size. It fits me prefectly. I wish I picked a next color though to up lift my skin tone,love the v cut in the back, I wore it to a Christmas dinner in church.


Exactly what I expected as I opened it. I am very happy about this dress. I tried it on on fell in love with this dress immediately. It is exactly as described and the way it looks in the picture. Im 5'4" and 135 pounds and 34C  and ordered a Medium. It fits perdectly. The arms are a little loose on me but it still looks great. The lining of the dress is too thin its see through but I'll just wear a tank and spank/dress slip underneath. Im so looking forward to wearing this dress to church soon. In my opinion you can wear it to a wedding also. It's semi formal but not too formal.


Its an affordable dress and the lace isnt cheap quality. Its actually pretty good material lace.


Looking forward to buying more dresses this seller.


Thanks Miusol


Beautiful dress. Made with perfection!!!


This is gorgeous. Love this dress


The dress looks amazing but over time the fabric starts fading and looks like a fungal spread


Great quality, pretty dress but it was 2 small.


This dress is absolutely beautiful. I had to return it because the bust was too large. Everything else fit perfectly. There is no xsmall so I cannot reorder.
