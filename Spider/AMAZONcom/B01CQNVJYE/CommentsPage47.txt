I was concerned that this dress may look chintzy, but it is anything but. The color is lovely and material is nice. I wear a 16 and the XXL fit well.


I am very upset I ordered this dress to wear to a wedding this sat and I received the wrong color. I ordered the navy and red dress and received the purple and black dress. Now I have one day to find something else to wear. I will be returning this dress.


I was skeptical but this was so cute once I tried it on. It fits well and is a super value. I received many compliments the nigh I wore this.


Beautiful dress, great material.  Good quality.  Fit perfect.  I am 5'6 and usually wear a size small or size four, but I am a little busty 36DD so I bought a medium.  Fit great and was knee length.


This dress is just like the picture, the flare and all. It's very flattering and well done. The material feels heavy, you will fell dressed. The only flaw I found was while making the bow. The material don't allow it to stay in place, I fix it with a little pin, and it was beautiful.


Im going to shorten it but I love how it fits and feels


Pretty but too big for small stature.


I am a size 12 women's so after reading reviews I prefer the xl. It arrived quickly and the colors were spot on. From there though I was not impressed. The dress just hangs unattractively. While the pictures show body and structure to the dress it is just the opposite. While I wish I loved it, I think this might be a one time wear dress.


Still love the dress even if it is somewhat.  Great fabric and style.


Beautiful on!
