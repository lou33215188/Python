very cute but I'm shorter than most and the belt line is in an awkward spot on my hips and not my waist.  But I'll still wear it :)


Love love love it!!!


Love this dress.  Ordered it for a wedding in CA and got many compliments on it.  Best part, it was around $30.  Fab!


great dress for great price! it fits just perfectly!


For info, I'm 5'5, 130 pounds, measurements breast: 33in, waist between 27-28, hips 35in. I ordered a small. I still have a little room in the dress. The colors are true to picture, the material and confection are the best! seems really sturdy and it falls right above the knee. I think that if you add a petticot skirt will look more like a fit and flare dress. The ribbon-belt it's attached to the dress. Love it! Misoul gets a new fan!


Fits perfect the dress!


Beautiful dress , comfortable


Just wrong send of review. Before


Love this but the zipper it's not closing right.


Fits like a glove - love it !


Dress was nice. Problem with zipper past piping at waist.


I'm typically a Medium but based on reviews ordered one size up (Large). Tried it on today and it fits great.  Will update with photo once I wear it to the event for which is was bought.
