Loved this dress!  It was perfect for a late afternoon/evening wedding at a beach resort!  Got several compliments on it too!!!  Material was great and sturdy and I did not experience any discomfort with the lace.  A little tight in the bust but I'm a busty chick so this was expected.  Overall the fit was great and I was not uncomfortable the whole 5 hours I wore the dress!


ğŸ˜� love it!!!


This is a perfect dress for me. Very comfortable.


Iâ€™m very surprised that this dress fits and is as beautiful as described!  The other reviews here are legit. Lol


Very pretty but even though same size I ordered but fit is tight.


This is my favorite !


This dress is really beautiful.  Quality fabric, not cheap


I ordered purple dress. I liked the fit but the material is awful. I ironed and steamed the dress a hundred times but it still looked like I just pulled it out of the bag.


I ordered my regular size and also the next larger size. I sent back the smaller one and kept the larger one. I love the style of this dress and it is really nice on. I will be wearing it to our NYE dinner and party.


The waist on the dress was too high on me.  Dress excellent quality and delivery was super fast.
