I was skeptical about ordering a dress online. But after reading reviews, I took a chance. Very nice, high quality dress. It's a classy dress!


Really cute! Comfortable, and looks just like picture. Great quality for price!


Fantastic! I love this dress! The fit is perfect and it is so well made. I was very impressed with the quality.


Very pretty dress. Beautiful colors and comfortable.


Best dress ever! Great for a variety of purposes, work with a blazer, a cardigan, heels or flats! Adorable and great buy- I'd buy it again in every color of the rainbow!


I received many compliments on this dress. Very well made, I was shocked at how great the quality was. Great price for how well made and how strong the fabric was.


It looks very age appropriate for my daughter's junior prom which is a glow party. The lace looks amazing under the blue lights, she was very happy.


Cute pattern but way too small in the chest, I'm a size 14 38DDD.


Loved the quality, but the size too small! Returned a d did not get larger size because you do not make larger size.


Super adorable but it was too small in the chest for me and I had to return. :(
