Love the dress but it is a little small. Still looks great!


Love it! The fit was great for me.


The dress is beautiful, because the material doesn't have any stretch the top is too small than my normal sizing.


Fantastic


Great fit.


Perfect fit medium for 36C size.


I wear a L but had to order a xxl.  Yet it is so comfortable and I received may compliments.


Beautiful dress, great quality, but make sure you order based on the sizing chart. I canâ€™t wait to wear this dress!


Its good


Really wears well with other accessories. My teen daughter looks great in this dress and it's her favorite. Dad knows fashion!
