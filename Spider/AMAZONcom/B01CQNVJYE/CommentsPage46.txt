I’m 5’6 and 190 lbs.  I typically wear a 12-14 post baby, and this fit perfectly! I wore it to a morning Bar-Mitzvah and in the evening for dancing, and it was comfortable and beautiful. Quality material for a great price! Would definitely recommend this purchase.


This dress is so pretty.  I'm wearing it to a wedding in February 2017 but I was able to throw a suit jacket over it and wear it to work too! Very comfortable and I got tons of compliments on the color and cut of the dress.


I like the dress a lot, but the sizing is not what I usually wear.


Love this dress!!! Will definitely look to order more this company! Sized correctly.


This dress has a loose area over the belly where the ruching is, so if you have a bigger belly, this will work. If not, you'll have this baggy/weird bunching of loose fabric. Did not work on my body. 5'8" 140lb


I love laces; they are so feminine, so elegant! This dress has simplicity and elegance. It feels good in it. Lovely colors.


stylish and i liked the material it was somewhat small in total was a good deal


Well made! I love it!! Lots of stretch to the material! I normally wear a medium and could have totally bought a small. It's a wonderful dress. Highly recommended! :)


The dress is nice but inappropriate for my purpose so I returned it. It did fit fine on although it appeared to skew very junior.


Hated it.. At first.


I went  with an XL im 5,5 180lbs. It was too large at the waist and bust So had some adjustments done.


When i got it to fit and when I wore it, I got so many compliments!. Nice dress.


Good buy afterall
