beautiful but it came with a defect so i had to return it


If you are usually a medium or size 8-10 ,! You should go for next size that's what i did based on the reviews I read.. I'm a size medium and large fits perfectly.. material stitches everything is nice..


My wife loves it. She is wearing it to a wedding this weekend.


Beautiful and seems to be great quality! Runs somewhat small. However, I look forward to wearing it! Love the colors!


I normally wear a large but ordered a medium after reading the reviews and ti fits very nice.


Super cute. Good quality. Great fit.


The sizing was not as expected so were the colors and fit.  Returned product


This dress is made well. Material is nice but it comes small. I am a size 12 but need to change to the next size. It fits well with one size up


Beautiful dress but too small.  I ordered medium according to US sizing but fits too small.


Lovely lace dress for wedding; color is pretty and fit is comfortable
