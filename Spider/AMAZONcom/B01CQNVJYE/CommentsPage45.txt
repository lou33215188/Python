Love this dress! Material has a little stretch to it so it has a very flattering fit.


I ordered based on the measurements on the sizing chart and it's perfect.


It fit perfectly and looked beautiful! Wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments, which is ironic because I bought it because I saw it on a girl at a bible convention and loved how it looked on her, she told me she bought it on Amazon so I ordered it too! Love this beautiful well made dress! Fast delivery too!


It's a nice dress but the knot doesn't look anything like in the photos, and it was also kinda larger than other similar sizes .


I might return mine after we return from our current vacation. My wife didn't wear it at all.


my daughter doesn't like it on her, somehow dress is cute.


I was a little worried about ordering this dress online because you always hear horror stories but this dress is absolutely amazing! So pretty. Material is not cheap.


This is such a nice dress for parties.


I used the size guide and it fit ok, it just felt a little big around the shoulders. It wasn't falling off, I just would've preferred it to be a little tighter but I suspect that if I'd ordered a smaller size it would've been too small.


Beautiful dress but it's to small, I went up a size and it did not fit . I will not return because I will give to my sister I hope it will fit her.


Fits beautifully...I'm pretty busty (38D) and wear a size 10 so I was skeptical getting a large or a medium. I am so glad I went with the large. It is so fancy and nice!


Very good quality for the price. Looks elegant on me; lace definitely not itchy. The length is 2 inches below my knees (I am 5' 2")but no big deal.
