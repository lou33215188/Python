made small


Very beautiful dress. Husband thinks it looks great on me.


I did not feel this dress was like the picture. I felt the size was a bit large and I think the colors were much darker in person.


Lovely color and fabric, but runs small.  Had to return it.


I really liked the style of the dress, but even a size xl was too small for me and I wear a 14 and xl in other clothing.  Sadly I had to retun it. I don't think the xxl would have fit properly.


Beautiful dress!! ğŸ˜�


This dress is beautiful and fits great! I can't wait to wear it!


Dress is fabulous loved it top is a little stretchy glad I ordered up.


I can wear 12-14-16 's depending on fabric. I ordered XL


Fit was perfect!


Would order again. Bought black & Navy


It's a beautiful dress -- fits good until you get to the zipper on or off the body.  Zipper doesn't want to zip all the way up.  I'm going to have my seamstress look at it and see if anything can be done.


Wow I'm so glad I ordered this dress. I am 5'4 154 lbs, 34c bra.  I ordered a medium.  This dress is perfect size for me. Maybe a little long... but otherwise perfect. It is a very soft and stretchy lace fabric, no see through parts so slip isn't needed. It's not scratchy anywhere!  I can't believe the quality for the price.  I will be ordering more from this designer.
