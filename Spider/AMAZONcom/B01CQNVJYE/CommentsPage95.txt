In love with this dress. I would recommended this dress to everyone. It fits perfectly. Great quality and good price.


This dress is very cute! I normally wear a size 10 and the large fit well. It was a tad big in the shoulder area. The fabric is soft and the colors are great! The lace does catch on everything, but that isn't a shocker. Overall a good purchase for a dressier event.


Very comfortable and beautiful dress and it fits as expected.
