Beautiful Dress! Fit great!


Good quality, beautifull details and colors


It fit as expected and everything, just didn't look as nice in person as I thought it would.


One of my favorite dresses, and I still can't believe I bought this online through Amazon. I feel confident in this dress with a petticoat or without--looks fabulous both ways.


The bodice and sleeves are MUCH tighter than I expected. From reading other reviews, I thought it would fit better. I got the XXL and I'd say it fits like a size 16 blouse. It's beautiful and well made of very nice fabric, but I've got to lose some weight before I wear it. I'm 5'3" and weigh 190.
