Love love love this dress. It looks great as is but I may get a slip to add a little extra poof


The dress fit perfectly, your size chart was the reason.  Thank you.

Was impressed with the qualitiy of this dress.  Bought this dress for my daughter, whom is 17.  She wore it to homecoming. Great quality.


I returned this because it fit too wide in the shoulders. I think my frame is too narrow for this style.


Beautiful and classy!


Another wonderful experience with an Amazon seller!!  A+++


Really nice fitting and looks fantastic.  Easy to get into and out of.


The dress is very cute.  But it is very dark! I ordered it for a wedding and it was a no go!


comes bellow my knees at 5'1, but very pretty
