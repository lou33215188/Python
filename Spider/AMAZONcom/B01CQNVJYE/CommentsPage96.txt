You must order a size up.  I did and it fit lovely.  Perfect for an office holiday party, received many compliments. Love the black and purple.


Beautiful outfit. My wife did not take it off for a long time.


She wore it for the next outing we had.


I loved the design ... I'm L size in this type of dress and it fit very well .. my weight is 145 pounds


Nice fabric, beautiful dress. Felt too tight in the shoulder area, limits movement when raising my arms.


Very pleased with this dress. Great quality for the price and with Prime, I received within 24hrs! Looking forward to wearing this to an upcoming family wedding.


Meh. Looked better on the web site than it did in person. I think the attached ribbon is made to tie in back, not in front as pictured. Nothing special.


Beautiful. Bought several options for a wedding and this may be the one to wear. I am between a 12 and 14. Purchased the xl. A little tight in the arms.


I am very pleased! Shockingly so, really. I was hopeful that this dress would work for an upcoming wedding and it absolutely does. Very beautiful and for the price, can't be beat!


Beautiful dress. Looks exactly like in the picture. I'm 5'3", 160lbs, 34B, and a size L fits perfectly.


Super cute dress just didn't fit me right. Would be perfect for a thinner more petite person.
