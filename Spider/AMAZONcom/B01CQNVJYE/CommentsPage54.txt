My mother-in-law loved this.


This was a perfect dress for my niece. Well made and true to size.


cute nice dress. got compliments~


Beautiful! fits perfectly on me but a li'l bit longer but the quality is good.


This dress was a gift for my daughter.  She LOVES it.  I'm always a little hesitant about buying clothes online, but the others who reviewed this dress convinced me that it would be a great fit for my full-chested daughter.  It looks beautiful on her and flatters her curves beautifully.


Perfect dress for an evening out or a special occasion.  Love the color (dark blue)!


Beautiful dress, fit perfectly. (I'm 5'8" and 145 lbs and I ordered a Large.) I got a lot of compliments on it. In addition to being pretty, it was very comfortable to wear. Good quality for the price.


Usually wear XL, ordered XL and it is perfect!!!!!! And what a plus, matches my shoes perfectly!!!


i was skeptical on ordering the dress from Amazon. But absolutely loved the color and couldnt stop myself. The dress was beautiful.


I usually wear a size XL and ordered a size XXL based on the reviews, and the fit was perfect!!!


the lace was a bit rough, but a quick rinse in cold water and the dress was PERFECT


I think the color is more red and blue vs red and purple but I still love it all the same. Perfect length for my height at about 5'9. Goes to my knee. It fits great and I love the lace. Perfect dress for the wedding I am attending
