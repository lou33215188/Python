This dress fit wonderfully, and I got so many compliments on it. The contrasting colors look even better in person than in the picture, too.


I love this dress.  Definitely order a size up per other reviews! Especially if you're on the curvy side like me.  The sleeves are a bit tight but I like the fit of the dress so much I may try to alter them myself (ha...wish me luck) or just deal with it.  I knew that there was a chance of this per the other reviews.  That or I may just wear it with a nice black sweater (it was bought for a holiday party anyway so its chilly and a sweater would definitely be warranted).  I was honestly pleasantly surprised with the seemingly good quality of this.  It seems very well made (you never know with amazon, lets be honest). And the price was decent so I'm definitely happy with my purchase.  The one star off is for the suffocatingly tight sleeves...ugh.


The dress is beautiful! Got lots of compliments. I'm 5' tall 115lbs and bought the SMALL. I would have preferred it a little tighter but it fit fine.


Received this dress today. As a 5'9 165 pound 38C/D lady, large is my normal size. This dress is pretty; however the dress was way too small and the arms were too tight. Order a size larger than your normal.


Great fabric and dress. I love the color. However the dress was too small in the bust.


Fits PERFECTLY to size.  Amazing material, look and feel.  VERY HIGH QUALITY!!!


This dress fits fantastically, but the ribbon is made of satin and therefore does not hold a bow well. The bow becomes heavy and starts to droop, leaving you looking sloppy. In addition, the lace wrinkles very easily and the fabric is hard to iron. Dry cleaning did not get out the wrinkles either.  Would not buy this again.


Use plus size models for plus size products.


Looks completely different.
