My wife's review- Beautiful dress and fits exact!! Bought me many compliments


A little small in the arms, love the design and colors. Very flattering dress.


Nice fit. Love it


Perfect fit, looked great on my daughter.


The dress is beautiful, great quality. Unfortunately, the SLEEVES of this dress are freakishly small... I ordered a size up due to some reviews and still can't fit my arms into the sleeves. So if you have bird arms and a large rack....this dress is for you.


Excellent dress. Better than expected. Babydoll looks amazing in this dress. Thank you


Tight thru the bodice - having difficulty with the zipper - and the decorative trim on waist line doesn't line up in the back, but for the price it is a nice dress.


Beautiful dress and excellent quality. Follow the size chart for the right size.

Very pretty. Was a hit at the party.
