Love It! So beautiful.  I am excited to wear it to the Purple Ball.


This is a beautiful dress I got it for my sister's wedding in October and can't wait to wear it just wish it was not so snug but that's ok


This is a pretty dress with eye-catching lace at a good price, but not really my style and it's going to be returned. I got the small size and it wasn't terribly fitted (I'm 5'3" and about 105 lbs with a 30DD bust) and I think that it looks a little sloppy as a result of not fitting snugly around the arms and bust. The fabric is kind of stiff--not uncomfortably--but enough that when I moved around or raised my arms, the bodice would warp and the shoulders would bunch up. Not the end of the world, but I prefer dresses that lie smoothly no matter how I move. The sash was also rather short and sewed around the front of the dress, so tying a (small) bow in back was the only option, and that's not as cute as a bow on the front side, as pictured. The sash is also clearly a part of the dress, and I think it would look better if it at least created the illusion of being a separate piece of fabric. (If it were actually separate, you'd also have the option of swapping it out for a different belt.)


Great dress!!! Loved the material and the color


Am 5'4"ft, 125 pounds , 34A bra size.....i ordered the small but its a little tight  ( am can get away with it ), but i can't gain any more pouds..ha


Anyways drees its beautiful and well made it looks like a spensive dress


Well made dress.  The fabric is heavy-duty with a bit of stretch.  I would recommend.


Beautiful dress! Fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. I usually try and get out of dress clothes as soon as possible, but I was fine riding for hours in this dress with no urge to change into something more comfortable. Definitely my new favorite dress!


This dress is not what I expected but it's okay.


Love this dress


Zip broke before it was even worn the first time
