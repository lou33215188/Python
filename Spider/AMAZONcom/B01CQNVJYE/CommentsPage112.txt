Beautiful dress and great price!


This dress is awesome! It's very flattering and fits perfectly. I often struggle with dresses being too short in the back...this dress is properly made and is the same length all the way around. At the time of me wearing it, I was plus size. I know buying nice clothes for plus size is a struggle, especially fancy things. I highly recommend this one.


Pretty dress made with decent material. Bought a size up based on reviews, but was a bit big so I'm returning it.


Really flattering. I'm so glad I purchased it!


beautiful, but to small


I love this dress. Perfect finish and perfect fit. Just wished the lenght was longer.


Looked very nice and got lots of compliments. Only needed it for one wear, so not sure how it holds up over time.


Was a lovely fit!  Will be worn to a fancy wedding!


LOVE this dress!


I loved it, will buy more
