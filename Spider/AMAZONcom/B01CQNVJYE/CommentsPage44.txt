Very pretty and nice. However if you have a large chest, size up 1. It fit nicely everywhere except my chestğŸ˜�


I am 5.2 and 217 lbs. I wish I ordered a bigger size. Nice dress but I will give it away.


LOVE this dress! I bought it for a formal gala I have to attend and it's perfect! Fabric is good quality. Fits great. And looks amazing! I bought a navy petticoat to wear under it to give it more volume. But it really looks good with or without a petticoat! So cute! Would definitely recommend! I usually wear between a size 10-12 and I got a size large. Fits perfect, not tight, length is just above my knees.


Much more beautiful than the picture shows.  Great quality.  So many compliments.  Highly recommend.


This model must be 7 feet tall. It came to my shins.


Very pretty dress and arrived in pristine condition. Fits true to description (per sellers specs). Looks exactly like the picture. Very happy with purchase.


I really liked the style and color of this dress; however, I had to return due to small sizing.


Beautiful color and style. I could have gone for a smaller size larger then I expected


I got so so many compliments on this dress it is so cute and comfortable. I bought it to wear for our companys Christmas party and loved it.


Needed a dressy navy dress for a wedding. Here in 2 days as promised.  Needed a Medium and this dress was a true medium fit.  My daughter has very wide shoulders and the lower cut back allowed for a perfect fit through the shoulders.
