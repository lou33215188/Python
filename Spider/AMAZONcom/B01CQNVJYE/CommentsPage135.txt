I am a 12/14 and ordered the xl. The 2x wasn't much bigger. I love this. It's really pretty!!


Gorgeous dress, I get compliments on it all the time. Only thing that removed a star is that the stitching is a little off in a few places but it hasn't been noticed by anyone but me.


Love this dress. I received many compliments.


Seems like I am the only one who did not find this dress attractive.


What a cute dress!  Sooooo worth the money

Very nice looks great


Very beautiful dainty dress. Good value for money. A bit snug for an Xlarge, considering I am a size 14
