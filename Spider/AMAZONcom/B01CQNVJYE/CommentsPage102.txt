For my daughter. She loved it!!


Order a size up, great color, great price, very comfortable


Amazing dress! Beautiful colors! Fits perfectly!


The dress is very pretty and fits well, but th e zipper is very hard to get up and down at the waist.


Amazing Value.


Beautiful fabric & flattering construction. Length hits just above the knee for 5'8".


I normally wear a 12 and ordered an XL and it fit perfect!  I got so many compliments when I wore this to a wedding!  love it!


Zipper didn't work, but nicely made for the price!


Love it! Very flattering! The only con is the zipper - it is difficult to get up and down past the ribbing, I can't do it myself while wearing the dress.


a beautiful dress, just too tight in the bust
