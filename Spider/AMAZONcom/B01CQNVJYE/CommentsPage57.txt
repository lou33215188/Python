Fit like a glove, flattering, great price. Can't beat it.


I loved the dress! It is so pretty. I did order a size up like recommended by the other reviewers, and they were right on. It is a very comfortable and easy to wear.


LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress! At 5'3", 135, I got a medium and it fits perfect. Beautiful dress!


I love this dress and got lots of compliments. It's great quality and affordable. I'm 5'6, around 150 pounds and the medium fits perfectly.


Highly recommend this dress!


The dress itself is beautiful and the coloring is simply stunning. While I did feel the XXL was small considering I have other Miusol dresses in the same size. The waist where the blue ribbon is located is not very forgiving (meaning stretchy) and the sleeves while they did stretch a little I felt more like Tommy Boy "Fat Guy in a Little Coat" where the shoulders and upper chest area being too tight to move the arms around and worrying you are going to rip it. Overall if you are of a thinner body frame this dress could be perfect. The quality is there for the price, the details in the lace are magnificent. I would definitely purchase if you are of a thinner body frame :-)


Nice dress, good quality, comfortable and flattering.


The dress is exactly as advertised, fits perfectly, and made out of comfortable material. The reason for a 3 star instead of a 5 star rating is because of the zipper, it is a knock off and sticks in a couple of places, I am sure it will break long before the dress falls apart.


I wore this dress to a wedding and received lots of compliments. The cut and fit was very flattering and I was comfortable the entire evening.


This dress is very flattering. The colors are so vibrant! I got many compliments on the dress and I've added a bunch of their dresses to my wish list because I'm so impressed with how well it's made.
