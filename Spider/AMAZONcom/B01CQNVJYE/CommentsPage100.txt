Beautiful dress


Too tight in the arms. Beautiful dress though. Really nice quality.


It's beautiful but much much smaller than the size indicates. Unfortunately I am unable to wear it to the wedding I bought it for because it is way too small.


Sent back. Just did not fit properly.


Sheer. Thin. Cheap. Returned.


This is a very pretty dress. I ended up returning it because I liked another dress better, but don't hesitate to try it!


Beautiful dress but quite long. I'm 5'1 and it was right below the knee.


Beautiful!


I go the dress for a wedding! I'm 5'2" and the length of the dress is bellow my knees. The fabric is excellent quality and the ziper as well. I love everything about it.


Looks much better in the picture than in real life
