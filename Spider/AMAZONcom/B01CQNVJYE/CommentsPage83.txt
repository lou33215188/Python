The dress was nice quality. I’m 5’3” 134lbs and ordered a medium. It was longer than expected and too big in the shoulders so I’m sending it back. Prettier then expected


Beautiful dress


Such a pretty dress! It fits just like a fit and flare should.  Very pretty colors.


This dress is one of my best finds on amazon. I'm generally never happy with my online dress shopping, but this one is perfect! The dress is long enough to cover my knees and fits perfectly! Wore this in vegas for a date with my husband and got a whole lot of compliments from strangers.


I like the dress a lot!! It was just a little smaller then I thought it would be. I ordered an XXL when I usually wear an XL.


I am very happy with the purchase..


Decent dress for a low price.


Order two sizes up


Good!


Really cute, but definitely order a size up or 2. The sleeves are tight, but the rest is fine. The colors match the picture
