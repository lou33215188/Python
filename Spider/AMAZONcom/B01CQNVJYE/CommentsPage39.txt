The dress is beautiful. The dress is very tight in the bust and the lace is delicate and tugging on the zipper could rip through the dress. Size up if you're anxious about fitting into the bust.


The dress may be beautiful but the sizing is completely off! I ordered one size up from my normal size and it still doesn't fit. You definitely need to order 2 sizes up to be on the safe side.


Awesome dress. My sister really enjoys wearing it and looks awesome in it. Good buy


The dress was as expected - just like the picture. I returned the dress only because it was too big on me. I am petite - 5'3" and 105 lbs. Quality was great for the price paid.


Beautiful dress, great quality. I have worn at least ten times now and plan to wear again this holiday season.


Looks beautiful on. I got lots of compliments on this one at a big event.


Beautiful dress. Bought it for my neice & she looked stunning in it. The color was as seen in the picture.


Made of good material


This dress is super cute.  The fit is nice.  It's comfy.  The bow and lace make this dress fancy enough to wear to parties.


Bought this for my daughter for a winter formal.  She loves it and has worn it to church also.  She has received compliments.  Although navy blue and black, it looks black unless you look very closely.  Overall, a great purchase.


This is a really cute dress! Nice navy and red colors but not too bright. Great for parties, summer weddings and church!


It's got stretch which makes it more comfortable. The price is very affordable. Love it ‚ù§
