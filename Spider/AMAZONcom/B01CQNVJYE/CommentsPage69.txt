I like the dress. It came down right at my knees where I wanted it to. I'm 5'6" and ordered an xl. It had a slimming effect that I was looking for.


I love my new dress it fits just as expected and the color is beautiful!!


I love it,


I love the dress, the dark red and purple is beautiful, i'm 5'3" tall and 135 lbs, so i got the large, its' not too tight, its very classy, as I plan to wear it to my brother in law's court house wedding, and then later to a dinner. Get it!!


As beautiful as picturedl, a great fit and good quality.


Really nice dress & material. I got an XL & it fit great. I usually wear size 14-16. I like that its the type of dress you can dress up or wear casual. I loved the purple color as well. I would totally recommend this item.


I love this dress!!! The colors are perfect!


Very flattering. Able to dress up or down. Modest cut and fit but styling and young too!


Looks great. Fits well. Good value for the price.


Such a cute and functional dress- I'm close to 6' tall and the length is still modest, and fits really well through the shoulders and waist.
