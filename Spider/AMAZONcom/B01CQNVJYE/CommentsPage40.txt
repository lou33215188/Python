This is a pretty dress, surprisingly well made. Perfect fit for me, I am normally size 12 and ordered a Large, fits me perfectly as other people described.


I'm between a size 12 and 14. I couldn't even  get it over my head, it was so tight!!


Arrived right on time. Fits very perfectly. I got a size small and I'm 5"1 and 110 pounds. Looks amazing. Very pleased with the quality.


I ordered in size large and it fit perfect on my body.  The dress is beautiful and great quality! Great for wedding or special occasion.


Dress is absolutely cute on and flattering but definitely size up maybe even two sizes if you are top heavy. I ended up with a small tear in the armpit lace trying to wrestle into it. Totally worked for the night, but still disappointed that it was a one wear experience.


Very cute dress!  I get many compliments, it's perfect for work or a dressier event. It's flattering and well made.


Really pretty but not for tall women. I am 5'10" with 36 D bust, and the waistline was too high on me. It may work if you're tall with a smaller bust or for someone shorter other than that it's really pretty but for me it's going back.


The only problem I have with this dress is that the made the sleeves a bit small....but otherwise a good fit.


it's beautiful on and fits me perfect - I ordered a small


Dress is so pretty. Only complaint is that it smelled like cigarettes. Iâ€™m a 12/14 got a XL.
