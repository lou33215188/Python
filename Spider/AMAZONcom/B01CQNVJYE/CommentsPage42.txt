perfect fit. the red color seems a bit brighter than the picture, which is a nice contrast to the navy. very flattering for busy girls. :)


I have worn this dress twice now, and have gotten compliments both times. Unique design, very flattering cut, and looks and feels more expensive than it is


I absolutely love this dress! I got the navy and black for a December wedding and it looked so nice. I ordered the medium and at my size of 145lbs with 36d boobs it fit perfectly. I am 5'1 so it was past my knees but that's the way I wanted the dress. Really loved this dress. It is great quality and would love to order from this brand again. I'm wanting to buy the petticoat though just to give it that extra umph.


I'm 5'7'', 35-24-36 and 125lbs and I got a small.


It fits well overall, looks very cute.


I'm 5'5 - 165lbs. The large is perfect.  A gorgeous coloring. Very flattering cut. O honestly didn't expect to like it as much as I do!


This dress is so pretty and the fit is figure flattering. I received lots of compliments when I wore it to my nephew's wedding.


Pretty dress. I followed the size chart and ordered a large--I usually wear a 6.  It fit great! Wore it to a wedding and got lots of compliments.


Beautiful! I'm wearing to my 2nd reception across the pond. It's gorgeous in color and a very flattering cut. I'd highly recommend it.


Nice dress, but it was not look nearly as fancy or formal as it doesn in the pictures.


Love this dress! I get compliments on it every time I wear it.
