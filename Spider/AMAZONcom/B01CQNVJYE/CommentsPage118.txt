It's fit because I ordered a bigger size dress because of those comments.


Well made, got many compliments.


The color is just as it is in the picture.


Love this dress. I am 5'4" and weigh 115lbs and small fit me perfectly.


Perfect fit


Super cute dress! It had a very flattering fit.


I have had this for a couple of months and I love it!


Very cute dress!! I am super picky about dresses and absolutely love this one.


very pretty but you should order up 1 size


Good quality loved the look just didn't fit my daughters body type


Good one
