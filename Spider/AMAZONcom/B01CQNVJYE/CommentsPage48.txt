This is probably my 6th Miusol dress, I LOVE their dresses!! I ordered this in x-large and it fit perfectly. I usually wear size 14 US.


Love this dress! It fit very well and was well made. I got a lot of compliments!


I did have to order a size up; that being said, I'm in love with this dress.  The quality is amazing.  When I told people I got it on Amazon they were stunned.  The colors are vibrant and the fit is fantastic!


Amazing dress! For the price, it's a steal!! Must buy!! I am 200lb, 5 foot 3inches. I ordered a size 16 just to make sure it fit, and it does! There is a little room, even! I feel like the lace and material is comfortable with a little stretch to it. I have muscular arms and was afraid it would be tight, but isn't. Thought I might need alterations but not needed!


Beautiful dress if only it could have a better lining which woul make the dress give the extra volume..


Beautiful and fit perfect!!  Love it!!


This was a gift for my sister and it fitted really well. She's super happy! The material is good and very good style!


The dress was very pretty. However, the zipper malfunctioned from the moment I started to try on the dress, so it could not be worn. Had to return it immediately. If the manufacturer improves the zipper, I would give this dress another try.


This was a gift for my niece, who lives across the country from me so I have not seen it first hand, but she says that she loves it.


had to return.. doesn't look right on my body or April wedding 2018
