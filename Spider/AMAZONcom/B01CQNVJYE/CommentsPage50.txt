Loved this dress!  got some many compliments on it as well. I wore this for a Christmas party and it was great.  I wear a size 10/12 in a dress and a large fit perfect!  The zipper in back it hard to move but with someones help you will be fine!  Great dress for the price


Zipper is very difficult to use. Great product but it is a 1 star just because the zipper


Very beautiful dress.


The dress was beautiful  and a Google quality I ordered using the size chart but it is to tight thru the  chest I will  have to  return it should  go up a size


Too long and cheaply made fabric


Couldn't love this dress more!  I received compliments everywhere I went...from co-workers to total strangers.  The color, cut and fit if this dress are all on point!  (I purchased the red).


I was looking for a dress for a fall wedding and this dress fits the bill. The dress is well made and of high quality. The material is think and the lace is beautiful. Definitely not cheap looking nor thin. I was hesitant about the color, but the two compliment each other well. I'm 5'2", 38D, 165lbs and ordered the large size. The fit is great with wiggle room and the length is perfect for my height.


Very pretty dress but ran to small and did not fit.


Dress was ok but a little snug.  Had to return.  fabric was thicker than I anticipated so would not work great as a work dress with a blazer.


Love this dress! Lots of compliments.  Very flattering.
