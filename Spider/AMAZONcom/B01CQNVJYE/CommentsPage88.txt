Cute and flattering


Love it.  Very Comfortable, will be great for traveling, which is why I got it.


Very pretty dress but I wear a size 16, from what others said I ordered 2xl. It is very tight


Beautiful dress


Too small for the size listed.


Very nice dress, especially for the price.  The fit is great, and I can wear this to more formal weddings and events.


I loved the way it fit. However, the ribbon was too short so that one couldn't possibly tie it as shown by the model. Apart from that, this is a great dress!!


The quality of the dress is great and it is just like the picture!


Perfect fit


It is well made and looks expensive for the price. I bought a wrong size so I had to order another it should arrive very soon
