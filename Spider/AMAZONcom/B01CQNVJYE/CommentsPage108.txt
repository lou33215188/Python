Love this dress! Cute, comfortable, and affordable.


great dress! i love it!


I got the wrong size, but I used your measurements. I would like to exchange it for a smaller one, because she loves the dress.


The dress will be perfect for the occasion i purchased it for. The zipper struggles to pass where the sash attached. I like the way the fabric drapes


Such a pretty dress and fits great. I got a lot of compliments on it at the office.


Beautiful! I am very pleased! Looks exactly as pictures And made well!


Pleasantly surprised! Bought this for a wedding and it was beautiful. Cheap price but didn't look cheap. I got a ton of compliments


I'm a 10-12. It never occurred to me to check the sizing.  It's just the style I've been looking for.  I'm hoping a larger size works.


Color is not as expected, but otherwise, great fit.


Very cute. Fits nicely.
