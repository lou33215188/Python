The dress fits nicely but is completely see through, I'll have to return it if I can't find a slip that works


bought for my wife, fits her very nicely, she has had several compliments, nice quality and price.


I am pleased with the fit and quality,  I think it's a good value.  The dress zips in the back so it's easy to put on.  Although it has a lining, it may still be somewhat sheer so I will probably wear a slip underneath.


It's a pretty dress but it's for juniors, not women. Definitely too small in the shoulders & bust.


Absolutely gorgeous dress. I listened to the reviews and sized up. Dress was too large. My normal size would have been fine. Will unfortunately be returning.


Need to return, too large , wish it worked out..


The waist is smaller than expected.


This dress looked great when worn. Fit very well!


Not a good fit and the material doesn’t feel right


This dress looks just like the pic ! However I thought it would be a nice party dress but it’s more of a church wear dress .. it’s not really a young fun dress .. somehow I misjudged :( it can be worn for a simple function but I think it’s more suitable for an older person who wants to be conservative , modest or covered up .. length is way too long on me will need to alter it by a few inches for it to look decent .. I’m 5’4 and 120 pounds and got the red in small.. I’m dissapointed that I was not able to catch this when I saw the pics and read the reviews ...will add pics if I get around to wearing this ever ..:((
