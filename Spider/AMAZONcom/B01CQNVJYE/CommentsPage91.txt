Zipper broke from the first try.


It's little loose on shoulder


Great summer dress ! Vibrant combination of colors and pattern ! It is a perfect casual dress , which can be easily accessorized for a night out .  Flattering fit .


Great dress. Good quality. A little tight around the mid-section but I also hate pasta before I put it on soooo


LOVE IT I ORDERED A COUPLE MORE FROM THIS SELLER, FIT A LITTLE TIGHT IN THE CHEST BUT THAT IS NORMAL FOR ME SO I WENT UP A SIZE ON MY NEXT ITEMS


I ORDERED A 2X AND I WEAR A 1X AND THIS DRESS WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT WOULD FIT SOMEONE THAT WEARS A SIZE 12 SO I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.


Bought an XL to be safe and I'm glad I did it fits perfectly. I'm 5'5" 190 but I have a large chest do the xl was perfect. Fits to size


I love the colors.


Not to sure hoe to clean it.


It's very pretty


Beautiful dress, it fit perfectly and I received alot of compliments. I'm 6'1" and size 16/18 so XXL was perfect!
