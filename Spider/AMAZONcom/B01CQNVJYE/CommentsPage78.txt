I absolutely loved this dress it fit everywhere except my arms, the color was perfect I was sad to have to return it.


Quite tight for an XL, but I love it, it’s so beautiful, I’m gonna keep ❤️


Beautiful dress! It fits as expected!


Beautiful dress! I absolutely love it.


The tie on the waist is higher than in the picture and the flare creates a pregnant effect.  Going to return for I will never wear it.


Love it--perfect fit, beautiful color, classy look. Love it!


I'm 5'5" 130 lbs. and ordered a medium. It is a perfect fit in all areas. Great price for this dress. Quality as expected. Lots of compliments.


not very quality


Beautiful! Fits perfect. Fast shipping.


I was a little disappointed.  The dress cuts off just under my knees instead of just above, and the blue tie in the middle is super slippery and won't stay tied
