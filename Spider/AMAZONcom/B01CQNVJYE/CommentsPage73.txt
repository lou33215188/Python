I love the dress!  I wish it was just a few fractions of an inch larger.  I can still wear it but it's pretty tight.  The style looks elegant and classy.  I will be wearing this dress to my sons'  wedding. it came when it said it would.

I've ordered other stuff from this company, but this was very large and baggy in the top. I returned it.


Bought this for my wife and it looks amazing on her.


Love this dress and the color combination!  I wore it for a 40th birthday party and received a lot of compliments on it.  I'm 5'4" and 145 and I got large which fit perfect.


Fit. Little loose. Too long. Will hem.


Perhaps it's because I wear an xl but this dress does not look, fit wise, like the picture. It is very high waisted and then kinda flares out. Not what I was expecting. It is made out of a nice soft stretchy fabric.


Another dress which fitted perfectly! Miusol really has wonderful dresses.  Keep it coming Miusol.


It was super cute and came in great condition but with someone who is larger chested, had to return, it didn't fit very well. It felt like it was made for someone with a short torso and smaller chest. So three stars for not fitting but threes stars for excellent condition and cuteness.


Beautiful dress with a great quality but it run's about 2 to 3 sizes too small. I ordered a 2x and it looked like a LG or xlg


Didn't even try it in...received a totally different dress than pictured...


Same colors but I received a long sleeve dress, not short sleeve, and it had 3 satin bands not a satin wrap into a bow.


Ridiculous
