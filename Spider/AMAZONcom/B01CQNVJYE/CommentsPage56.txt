I ordered a dress that pictured is lacey, short sleeves, and round neck. What I received looks like a trench coat, totally different martial, collared neck, buttons in the front. Not at all what was described. The return process is proving to be very simple though.


I wear a size 2-4, and am small chested. Based on reviews of this dress, I ordered a size medium, and I'm so glad I did! It fits small in the shoulders/chest area, but a medium fits me perfectly.


The colors and lace fabric are really pretty, and the dress has a liner which is nice to not have to wear a slip.


I'll be wearing it to an April wedding, and it will be perfect!


It fit well in the top, but the bottom was a little bit longer than expected.  I'm 5'8" and bought a medium.  It was still too long for me.


OK. Couldn't figure out what to do with the bow.


Beautiful dress. Wish it had slightly less material in the skirt. I can see how the arms are tight on some people, but mine fits well. It is indeed see through! Be prepared to wear a slip.


Overall it fits and looks great except for the satin bow/belt. I wish that wasn't there. It looks better when you can't see it.


The material is very good, the dress runs somewhat big and it's not exactly as pictured. The ribbon doesn't go all the way around the waist and it's higher in the dress, it does not sit at the waist.


Fits great! Very nice quality!


I am 5'11", about 230 lbs.  The dress didn't look as good on me as I had hoped.  It's a beautiful dress and on someone else it looks amazing.  5 stars because it is well made and beautiful...it just didn't look right on me :(


Love the outfit it was too short across the chest area, I did reorder a larger size
