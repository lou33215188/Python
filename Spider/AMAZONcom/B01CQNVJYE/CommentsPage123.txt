Love the dress! It's beautiful and great material.


Satisfied


Adore this dress!


Fits very well and very well made and well priced


Looks great and arrived promptly.


Dress is as pictured, maybe a little darker read, making the whole dress look purple, but very pretty.  I think the dress would have fit very well, except for the sleeves.  There is no give in the arm hole, pinching my upper arms.  Very uncomfortable, so I'm sending it back pronto!


Wore this to a wedding and received many compliments.


Very poor quality


This dress is beautifully made!  It looks exactly like marketed.  I will be wearing it to a spring wedding but it would also be great for holiday parties and, a plan is in motion to wear it to the Kentucky Derby next Spring with a big floppy hat.  The point is, it is dressy enough to wear to a fancier function but universal enough to wear to not so fancy functions.  I normally would have bought a Medium however, after reading reviews from others (Thank You!!) I did size up as "the girls" are on the bustier side of things!


I'm 5'7 and 146#. The large was too tight.
