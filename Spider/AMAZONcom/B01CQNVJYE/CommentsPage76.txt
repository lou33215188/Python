Material and color is beautiful! I ordered a medium because of other reviews.  Well, It's true to size. I'm 5'2 125lbs and usually wear small. I should've ordered a small. Will return medium.


I'm 5'6, 125 lbs and the medium fit perfectly! This was my first MUISOL dress and I will definitely be buying more. Fabric is good, fits well, and it's a beautiful dress. 5/5!


Loved it!!!!! Beautiful!


beautiful dress  about an inch shorter waist would have been great


Color is not as bright and attractive as it looks in the pictures. It is pale.


the XL fit perfectly, the XXl was a little big. But loved them both.


I was skeptical until I tried the dress on, because of its price.  It was not too short as I am 5' 4.5"; it hit just below the knees.  I am 68 and will be wearing it to a gala fund raiser.  This dress is really cute and my husband loves it.


As described and nice material.


Fits well and was very comfortable. Better quality than expected for the price.


Dress fit is true to size, I'm not normally one for dresses but needed for an occasion & I love it!
