Beautiful dress


This is a very nice dress that can go between casual and partying.  The sash/belt is made of satin and the dress itself is a couple layers of different-colored materials.  This dress has a woven design and IS NOT A PRINT.  I love the the quality of this dress - definitely not cheaply done.  The underlying layer is a darker-blue material that is just barely sheer when put up to a light, but on your body, you can't see through it (although it does make the dress very cool and airy).


Overall, this is a very pretty dress that'll make an excellent addition to the wardrobe!  Please note - this review is based off of a discounted review sample from the vendor.

I even ordered a size bigger and it was still a little small


Nice fit


Very cute! Great quality for a great price.


I bought this for a wedding.  It's gorgeous, but it just fit so strangely on me.  I'm 5'4", and it seemed much larger on me than on the model.  Also, with the way the pleats around around the waist, it made my waist look huge.  Also minimized my bust.  It just didn't fit me well at all.  Returning it.
