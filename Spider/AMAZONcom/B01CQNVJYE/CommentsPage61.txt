Fits perfectly, zipper gets a little stuck at the ribbons around the waist.


real cute, but a little small, like it is make for a teenager not a woman


I luv luv luv it. Quality is excellent. I can't believe how pretty that was. That is even better in person. Perfect fit and perfect size.


Good material and doesn't look or feel cheap. Looks and feels good on. great color without being in your face. Nice details.


I love this dress. I normally wear a size 12/14 and the XL fit perfectly. The feel, fit, and quality of the dress is spot on. The only negative is that the zipper on the back sticks a little at every junction.


Got my mom this dress and it fits her so perfect!


She loves it!


Great quality!


Cute, heavy material, very solid.. 2 sizes too small. Sending back.


Something about the lace seemed cheap.


This dress fits perfectly.  I ordered Medium and I normally wear medium.


Perfect and lots of compliments.
