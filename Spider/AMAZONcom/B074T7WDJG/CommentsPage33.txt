The product is exactly what it looks like. Just a little tight in the arm area.


This is a beautiful dress.  Slightly itchy around the edges of the sleeves but I expected this.  The dress didn't fit slimmer around my waist like I thought it would.  Instead it was fitted about 1 1/2 inches higher.  My ribs stick out in this area so I had to send it back and order a size larger, but it is overall a good product.


I gave this dress a five star due to it being absolutely stunning! The only thing wrong with it was that I had bigger bust than I thought! But other than that I loved it. I have returned it but maybe will order in the future if they offer bigger sizes.


This dress is very nice..


It's beautiful...


Beautiful dress for a beautiful price! So elegant and I'll be wearing for a wedding but I ordered the wrong size!


I bought a size 16 going off of your size chart I bought a size bigger than I actually needed and it will not zip up. It is entirely too small and not true to size. Very disappointed. I am a 38-40 in the busy and that's where it is about 4 inches off from zipping up


I ordered this as a back up dress for a Mardi Gras Ball. Not only did it fit well, no one could tell it was a $30 dress. Amazing deal. Plus, I'm 5'11 & it was long enough for me. Will definitely recommend


Beautiful dress; I got SO many compliments. I do wish I ordered a smaller size.. I'm "hippy", but small in the top/bust area. The only negative about this dress: the insides of my arms (especially in the armpit area) got scratched and irritated, due to the sequins. I didn't wear this dress for that long, so it wasn't to big of a deal. Overall, I would recommend this dress.


I love this dress. So pretty. Flows so nicely on the body.
