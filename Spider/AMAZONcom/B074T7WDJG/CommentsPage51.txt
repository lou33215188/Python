Very nice dress for the price. I would say order a size up. The dress is very long but was easy to hem.


Totally worth the money. Fits comfortably. Much better alternative to spending $300 on Avery similar dress at the bridal shop. And this one is lighter weight!!


My daughter is a size 12 i bought the size 16 and still very tight would not zip.


no stretch at all to this dress.


Beautiful. Not too low cut but definitely shows cleavage


great quality


Fit perfect!


Beautiful dress, ended up returning it because I found something I was more comfortable in. Under the arms, there is a weird spot with no sequins, which I'm sure makes the dress more comfortable, but is unfortunately visible when you've got the dress on. Weird? Not overly noticeable, however, and would not have been a deal breaker for me. Lovely dress though, and long enough for me to wear a short heel (I'm 5'8").


It has a nice fit, not too clingy! It's beautiful and under the arms isn't scratchy, which is nice!


This dress is beautiful and if it weren't for the fact that it was probably 3 inches too long (even with 4inch heels), I would have kept it. The quality is great. It does have the mush under the arms like one reviewer said. It's comfortable and fit extremely well. I ordered a size 2 in red and it fit fit great everywhere except the length. To put it in perspective, I'm 5'3", 110lb and a 32C chest. The dress definitely makes a statement. It's also good quality and in the few minutes I was wearing it while trying it on, it wasn't loosing sequins, which is a plus. I recommend this dress if you are tall or have time to get it hemmed.


beautiful!!!
