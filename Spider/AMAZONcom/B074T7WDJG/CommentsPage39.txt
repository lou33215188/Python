Good fit but I needed bigger boobs. A push up bra helped some. A little long but I didn't have time for alterations. Overall perfect for the occasion.


The dress is drop dead gorgeous,fits actual size and comes just as pictured. It is perfect for a wedding, prom and formal events.


The picture of the green does not show true color. It’s more of an aqua blue.


I'm 5'7 and 140 lbs and ordered it in a size 7. Fitted perfectly except around the breast area. It was a little loose. Gave it a four because some of the sequins fell off, or was hanging loose.


Nice dress but much smaller than expected from description.


Got it for a costume type awards ceremony, more as a joke...but it looked great, fit great, and I got lots of compliments.


All I need is my good bra and I'm good to go. Pics coming soon.....


The dress is GORGEOUS and good quality - but even ordering a size up the dress was way too small....I may order two sizes up, but I fear the dress was mislabeled, as the sizing seems pretty far off. Gorgeous dress, just wish it fit!


Love the dress ! I would highly recommend buying from this brand again the dress even came in sooner then the estimated delivery date! Only thing is I’m 5’2 and half to get it hemmed. Other then that great!


It's a beautiful dress, very flattering. However, it's a little scratchy and tight around the arms. It's also super long, even wearing heals, and the sequins fall off easily .
