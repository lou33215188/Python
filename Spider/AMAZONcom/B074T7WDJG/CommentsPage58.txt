very itcthy


This is a great dress for the price. I used it for Halloween to be ginger from gilligan's island.


It fit too great....actually. LOL It showed all my curves was great, but the color was not for me.


very beautiful gown; but having  small breast, it would cost more to have it altered


great for the price, enough length to fit long legs, but too long for me (5'4")


Small to size


Itâ€™s a good price and a dress to wear once! The quality is good...


Was over a week late but pretty dress


Very pretty on. Nicely made. Great quality dress for a descent price. May run a bit small.


Beautiful and true to size!!! Ordering 6 more for my bridesmaids in the fall!
