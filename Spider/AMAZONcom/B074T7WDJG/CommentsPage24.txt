Dress was real nice,  wish It had a petty coat under it. But overall I would buy again.


This dress is awesome! Super pretty and sparkly. Well constructed and fits true to their size chart. The sequins are a little itchy tho and it's probably a little more low cut than I'm used to. But overall, it's awesome and perfect for what I needed.


Beautiful dress but it runs small and doesn't fit.


Loved it but was too small, very pretty though


I bought this to perform in and it didn’t let me down! A really nice dress for the price. I am 5’3” and 125 lbs. - I ordered a 6 and it fits beautifully. Beware that it is VERY sequin-y, more so than I expected. It doesn’t make it any less stunning or flattering, but that is important to know if you’re not a fan of being sparkly.


I am so happy with my purchase...i bit long but nothing hard to fix.....


I purchased this dress a size larger but should not have. It was true to size, I did not lose any sequins, and it was wonderful quality. I ended up returning and purchasing a smaller dress, wish I had bought this in the right size because it was perfect.


I ordered a size up and it was still pretty snug, but I loved the dress. It wasn't the best quality as the sequence fell out as I put it on and wore it around.


The dress was absolutely beautiful! Make sure you order according to the size chart in the listing pictures, don’t go by the standard amazon sizing. Can’t wait to see my bridesmaids rock this dress in my wedding!!
