The size chart was pretty accurate at least for me. However I did lose quite of bit of sequins just from opening it and trying it on.


It looks exactly like the picture. Fits as expected. No complaints here. Got what I wanted and what I paid for. Reasonable price. Got here fast.


I love the dress thanks I get it on time just 1minutes before the wedding. Thanks.


Customer service great.ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚


The response and customer service to return the dress was prompt and amazing. The dress was not for me.  True fit as expected by using the size chart.


More beautiful in person than in the pictures. Great quality for the price. It fit true to size and is very comfortable.


Beautiful, but runs a bit snug. Zero stretch!


For the price this dress is awesome! A little big and the sequences shed, but I am so excited to wear this out!


Very good for the price. Looks beautiful and relatively comfortable. Perfect length for wearing with heels (as I'm 5'7 and wore 3 inch heels). Looked lovely!


I LOVE THIS DRESS!! I will say it showed a bit more cleavage than I expected but otherwise it was perfect. The cut on the dress is sure to flatter any figure. I spent the night getting tons of compliments! Great purchase and great price!


I ordered this dress as a bridesmaid in my best friends wedding. I could not believe the price, and it looks just as great in person as in photos. I mean STUNNING. I have walked in bridal shows, and the quality of this dress is on par with more expensive bridal shops, prom dresses, etc. The only down side was that my zipper did not work properly I had difficulty unzipping it on the hanger, then once down, I was not able to get it back up. The main reason I'm writing the review is because of what happened next! I contacted he seller, really not sure what to expect. Her response came unbelievably fast, and she worked so quickly to help me find a resolution. I have worked in customer service myself, and this far surpassed what I have ever seen in the industry, let alone for such a well pressed gown. I highly highly recommend this seller. Truly can't say enough great things!
