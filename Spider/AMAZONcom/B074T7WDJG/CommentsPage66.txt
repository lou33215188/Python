On time. Great quality. Fit perfectly. Want to order for friends so I hope they restock soon!! :)


Purchased as a bridesmaid gown for a NYE wedding and it was perfect. The price was in my budget, it fit as expected. I'm 5'9 and approx 200lbs. It fit nice in my torso but I did have to put a small safety pin to kind of close up the cleavage a bit. Now, if you plan on dancing a whole lot or anything with tons of movement, beware that because the sequins wrap all the way around and under the arm, that your underarms might get raw due to rubbing against them. I had some pretty raw underarms but none-the-less, it was worth it


LOVE IT! Can't wait to wear it in August!!! :)


The material is good, I like the dress!


Awesome
