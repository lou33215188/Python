Loved this dress!! Received so many compliments. Someone actually asked me if I rented it because it looks designer. Can't beat the price. I'm a seamstress so I was able to make some necessary adjustments to the straps and had to hem the length but I'm short and have a short torso so I have to do this to most of my clothes anyway. I always have a hard time finding dresses to accommodate my larger chest and this one was perfect for me.  The size seemed true to size to me and was flattering on my 2.5 month post-partum body.


I bought this dress in rose gold in two sizes. I usually wear a 14 in jeans and I am a 36DDD top. The 16 fit the best but would need a stitch otherwise everyone will see ALL your goods! The 14 fit but the sequins were more scratchy and uncomfortable. This dress is beautifully made but in the end I returned them both because the color wasn't good with my skin tone and I realized I am not a fan of floor length dresses no matter how nice they look on someone else. I am 5'6" and the dress would've needed to be hemmed 3 inches or so. Maybe not at all if I wore 3-4 inch heels.


It fit phenomenally. The length was perfect and sizing was great. No complaints at all. It’s definitely a beautiful dress. I’m normally hesitant on ordering dresses online because I’m so tall but so thin but this dress was perfect. It’s definitely a show stopper!
