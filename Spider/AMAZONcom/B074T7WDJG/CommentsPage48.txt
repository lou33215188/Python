Beautiful dress. I purchased it for a Vegas party. Bodice is a bit tight but all sequins are intact. I am happy with the purchase.


Bought these for my bridesmaids and love them for the price. The color is great. It is a little scratchy under the arms, long, and some of the sequins fall off but overall a wonderful dress. The fabric feels like good quality fabric.


Bought this dress for a friend's wedding and it shipped very quickly and fit perfectly.


Great dress!


Long as I expected since I am 5'2", otherwise, perfect fit!


It was a great fit, but had a hole in the back and it wasn't the same style as the website at all.  It definitely wasn't the dress i ordered


Absolutely perfect for my bridesmaids dresses


Super fun and stylish dress to wear for a special occasion. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the glitter falls off a ton from this dress.


I like this dress.  Very elegant.


gorgeous dress, just a little darker than what I thought it would be, lighting changes the color to look a yellow gold.
