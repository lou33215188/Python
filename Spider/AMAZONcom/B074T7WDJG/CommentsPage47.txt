Beautiful! If you're in between sizes, order up. I'm typically a 6 but I went with an 8. It's surprisingly comfortable and looks like it cost much more than it did!


It fits and lays well just a little tighter than I expected as I went up a size just in case but the gold pieces on the dresses fall all over the place.


The size was perfect but super long!


This dress is perfect. Perfect fit. I absolutely love it. Everyone love it at the wedding! ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


The sequins kept scratching me under the arms, but the dress looked great!


I am a singer and I bought this dress for a tour show. Zipper broke after only a couple of uses. Beautiful dress but useless without a proper zipper. Disappointed. :(


Wore this for a military ball and absolutely loved it!  It was so comfortable that I plan on wearing it again for prom!


It's beautiful.


There are no words, it is so beautiful. If you are hesitant for any reason, please donâ€™t! The size is a little small. But if you wanted fitted just get ur normal size


The dress looked pretty, but it didnâ€™t fit properly. The band around the waist was very snug, and I spilled out of the top.
