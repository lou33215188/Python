Awesome dress I got for my mom for my brothers wedding. Looks awesome she 5"4-180. And I ordered size 16 plenty of room  were going to get it tailored because it's long


This dress is gorgeous!! I am 5'4".. 32, 26, 33 and the size 2 is perfect! (If I had a bigger chest size it may not have fit since the bust part is snug.) So excited to wear this beautiful gown to a special event. I was a little scared because the price seems too good to be true and I didn't know if I could trust the reviews but the dress is excellent quality. In love.


Awful!  Dress is not worth the money, I regret this purchase.


Pros: Very pretty and fit as expected when ordering by sizing chart.  Cons: Sequins were a little itchy in the armpit area, the sequins were falling off everywhere, and it was much more low cut than expected.  The dress was very lovely, but was not what I was needing for my event so I returned it.  Loved the dress and wanted to keep it, but it just wasn't for me.


Bought as bridesmaids dresses and they fit great. My sister in law wears a size 22 in her Mardi Gras gowns and she fit into the 16 and it was a little big on her! Great prices and great quality!


WAY too small but it was very lovely.


Received this dress today, which was sooner than I originally quoted! Dress is lovely. Gave it 4 because it did lose a few sequins while I tried it on and the zipper isn't the easiest to zip. Would recommend!


I would have kept this dress but it was just way too long and big. I tried a different vendor, but still same problems.


Runs very small


What a beautiful dress! I usually wear a 16, but the 14 fit me like a glove. Flattering, drapes well at the hips, and looks far more expensive than it was. It sheds sequins here and there, but I've never had a sequined garment that doesn't.
