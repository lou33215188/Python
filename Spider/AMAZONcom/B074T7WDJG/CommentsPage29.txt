I feel so beautiful in this dress. I usually where a size 12 but for this dress I had to go up for a size 16. I'm 4'11 so I absolutely have to get it hemmed.


LOVE this dress!


I would typically wear a 14 or 16 in a dress depending on the type. I wish I would have went up 1 size for room to move. And the "v" neck is a little substantial but nothing a quick pin couldn't fix.


This dress was perfect for my ball.  Looked great and was a great price!


Lots of compliments on this dress!!  Although I ordered a 6 and it was a little tight around the chest. Either way a great dress priced right to wear it once!


Although I didn't end up going to the event I had planned on wearing this to, the dress still exceeded my expectations! It fit great and the material was of higher quality. However, I did show this dress to my recently engaged cousin and she now plans on using these as her bridesmaids dresses!


I bought this as a bridesmaids dress. The sizes run small, so get a size up from what you usually get. The color looks exactly as pictured. It's good quality and affordable, as far as bridesmaids dresses go.


Flattering for all shapes and sizes... I got a size up because I read some reviews and I want it to be comfy and not too tight. I got a 16 because I am broader on the top. This dress does not have much stretch, but if you wear it around the house, it will give a bit.


The sequence on this dress was not nice at all. Could definitely see where they ended and where the fabric stuck out. Also was small.


The dress is beautiful!  It's a bit long in length and in the straps.  I'll have to have it tailored a bit.  But I'm 5'6" so it's just designed for someone much taller.  For the price it's worth buying it and having a few small alterations done.  It is definitely worth so much more than the price!
