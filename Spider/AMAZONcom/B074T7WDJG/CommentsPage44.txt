The dress itself is gorgeous, especially for the price. However, I only gave it 4 stars because the sequins are very rough. it caused a lot of irritation under my arms


I was very wary about buying dresses online, and I was very worried, because my prom was in a month. Dress was beautiful, and fit as expected. Zipper was aa little difficult, but totally worth it.


I'm a size 4 in dresses so I ordered a 4 it's kinda a struggle to get the zipper up in the middle part but other than that it fits great & it looks very nice I have the silver dress ğŸ™‚


It is very nice, and is good quality for the price. After trying it on, I recommended it for the three other bridesmaids in my daughter's wedding! Of course, we plan to wear tan camis with the dress :) !


Very scratchy material.  Not comfortable at all.  Did not wear.  Need to return.  Can I have feedback on how to return this item.  Thank you


The dress is good quality and is very pretty! I ordered a size 4. I am 5'4, 120lbs, and the dress fit perfectly except it is very long even with heels on. I will need to get it tailored.


Absolutely stunning & very well made. I'm about 5 ft 2 in & 110 pounds and a size 2 fit snug & perfectly. Great length to wear with heels also. Loved the red for a Christmas holiday party.


I liked the dress.... but I had to return because my husband said he didn't particular like the style on me


Some of the sequeens were loose and started to fall off. The dress was very, very long.The color  and the design were okay. That's why I rate it a 3.


Beautiful
