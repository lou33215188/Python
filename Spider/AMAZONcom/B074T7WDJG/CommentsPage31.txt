Itchy but fit great and looks better than the price.


This was perfect for the formal banquet I went too.


Nice


Very pretty dress for the price. I am 5’4” 133lbs. I got a size 4 and the arm holes were suppppper tight, and the zipper kept getting stuck on the sequins. I’m sure the 6 would fit better. The material is nice and the gold is beautiful.


Was a little large in the chest region, but other than that it fit great.


Dress is absolutely gorgeous and light weight.


Just received dress. Super dirty on inside, will be returning. Black in stains show to front of dress as well. Length was great,fit true to size. Pretty scratchy on arms.


YES MICHELE OBAMA GLAM STR888 I LOVE IT!!


I love the dress, but it's not for my body type. I have large bust, so I bought the size 14 based on the measurements. It does fit, but it reeeeeally accentuates that area. Because of that, the waist line hits me higher, right below my boobies. So the dress doesn't look right on me. It fits, but not the right fit and I can't just order a size up, because the chest area would have extra room and the bottom would be too loose.


However, it is a very nice, quality dress. The sequins really make it pop and it looks like I paid a lot more for it that I did. the stitching is nicely done. So, unless you have big chest like me, have no fear when choosing this or just go up a dress size.


Needed serious hemming, despite the wearer being 5'7" But it's lovely and was a great prom dress.
