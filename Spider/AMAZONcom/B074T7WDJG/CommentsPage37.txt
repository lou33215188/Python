Love this dress, fits as a glove and is incredibly flattering. You can wear it without a bra and feel super free and comfortable. I'm even considering buying it in different colors.


Wore to a Holiday Formal - received MANY compliments!  I'm 5' 6 1/2" and wore very tall heels.  Dress was still a little too long but I didn't have time to have it hemmed.


LOVE this dress! I got so many compliments. Fits very true to size and very comfortable.


Beautiful dress! I would highly recommend.


This is a beautiful gown, please refer to their sizing chart. I am 5'4, 36DD or 40, waist 32, hips 40, usually size 8 in jeans, 10 dress, I ordered a size 12 and it fit perfectly! You will not be disappointed!


Attention fluffy members of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee... do not purchase.


Fits perfectly! And arrived in a very short amount of time which is great because I was ordering this dress our company holiday party and I needed time to decide if it would work. I can't wait to show it off! Great vendor to work with!


This is is beautiful. It most definitely exceeded my expectations. The arm holes a little tight but that's the only complaint & it's a very minor one. I love this dress. I was so impressed by the dress for the price. Sequins do fall off occasionally though.


Beautiful dress. Just a little tight under the chest area.  Everywhere else fits great.


gorgeous gown!  quality is exceptional, especially for the price.  purchased as bridesmaid dress.
