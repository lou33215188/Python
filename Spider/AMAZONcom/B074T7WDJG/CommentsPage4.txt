I could not believe how beautiful this dress was when it got here. My bridesmaids will be wearing this dress in my November wedding. We used the sizing chart and it fits perfectly!


This dress is amazing for the price. I am 5'9 and 158 lbs 36 b cup and the size 10 fits like a glove. Length is long! I am tall and still have some dragging the ground, should be perfect with heels. Rose gold color is pictured.


I ordered a size up and it fit perfect! I loved the dress and so did everyone else, great for not just a single event. Sequins aren't for the weak, so there was a little scraping around the arms. But nothing too unbearable. :)


SO IMPRESSED with this dress. Shipping was less than 4 days to Washington state. I followed the size chart listed in the photo which put me at a 14 (usually I wear a 10-12) and it fit perfectly. The chest portion is quite large, even for my DD's, but that's an easy fix. Fully lined, so it is not itchy. The rose gold colour is stunning, and the sequins were securely fastened all over. The extra lining under the arms prevents the arm scratching. I cannot WAIT to wear this to every wedding this summer! I would absolutely buy again for my own bridesmaids in the future. This dress looks like it would cost several hundred dollars in another store.


I purchased this dress to use as my reception dress for my wedding next month. My actual gown has a steel boned corset as part of the design, and I knew I would not want to be in that all evening, but I wanted something both elegant and comfortable that would be cost effective. I was not disappointed! I am a solid size 14 in most street clothes and I am 5'8", so I ordered one size up, since formal wear typically runs a size small. It fits like it was made for me! The dress just brushes the floor, so I will be able to wear flats or heels as I choose. It was sewn well, and does not look cheap at all! I am so excited to have a dress to change into that will turn heads just as much as my gown will. It's perfect.


****UPDATED**** My wedding was 10/7/17, and this dress was BRILLIANT. It fit beautifully, needed no shapewear underneath, and looked WAY more expensive than it was. When my husband and I arrived back at our hotel after the reception, hotel guests actually thought THIS was the wedding dress. HIGHLY recommend.


Love it! I wish I would have found this earlier because I know one of my bridesmaids wanted a dress just like this. In the bridal salons they are 200+ dollars. I decided to order this for my bachelorette party night, why not! It i stunning and very well made! I will definitely post photos later.


I am usually a size 10 but have been busting my butt in preparation for my wedding. The 10 fit great and I even had a little room to move if I wanted to take it in. I disagree with some of the reviews, this fits as expected. I am 5'8" and probably 165 lbs.


Love this dress!


I ordered this days before a fancy wedding. I ordered the 12 and the 10 cause I wasn't sure if I should size up based on the reviews. They both fit almost exactly the same but I went with the 10. I am a size 8 in jeans and a 34DD. The dress is a little boobalicious, I had to pin it... but it's gorgeous. I'm 5'5" and worse heels and was totally fine with the length. I had everyone asking where they could find this dress on rent the runway. They all thought it was the 2,000 version! ğŸ˜�


The dress arrived on time. It was beautiful on and I felt like the belle of the ball. I wore it to a wedding. I chose to wear the dress off shoulder and because it was true to size I was able to do so. The material is heavy and high quality, definitely worth the price. I'm 5'2, petite and I wore 4 inch heels, it's a long dress. I ordered a size 2.


this is the most amazing dress. I cannot believe the price! I looked and felt like a goddess. The rose gold color is perfect. It held up so well, was not crazy uncomfortable, and did not excessively shed the sequins-- some were shed, but I find that to be expected with any heavily embellished garment like this. This looks and feels like a $200 dress, and ran true to size, don't be afraid to buy it because it's on the internet. you will look fantastic, and the cut is great for all kinds of shapes and sizes!


I bought this dress ti wear for my niece' wedding. It was a hit. Fits true to size. So worth the money.
