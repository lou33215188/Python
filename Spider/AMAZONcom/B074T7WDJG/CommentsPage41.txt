I love this dress! I was very nervous about buying something online and it was perfect!


The product I received was completely different than the one pictured. It had no empire waist, and had mesh panels in the back.


It fits me great all of the measurements were accurate! I am 5’4 and it is a little long but that was expected based on the measurements and planned to wear heels


Beautiful gown. Beautiful! I'm an 'apple' shape, and it fit just beautifully... besides the fact that I need a larger size. That's my fault though. Lol


Very pretty, arrived quickly, and was perfect for my event. I was a shining star in a sea of black dresses. The event was black and gold, this dress was perfect with back accessories.


The dress was more than I expected for the price. My 14 year old wore this for formal night on the cruise we went on. She got so many compliments and looked absolutely stunning!


I think this gown fits tall people. Size runs small. I probobly have to go 1 size up for the right fit and 2 sizes up for comfortable fit.


Beautiful gown wore it for my son's 16 party and it's simply beautiful!


Very nice quality for the price and just as pictured, the girls (bridesmaids) love them and especially that you can wear a regular bra with them) gonna look great on wedding day. Just a little on the long side.


It was perfect for the red carpet. I didn’t even have to do alterations!
