Looks great on! Very flattering and similar to the picture online. Highly recommend!


Very pretty and flattering! I would plan on getting something to help with the sequins rubbing under your armpit, but great otherwise. Looks much more expensive than it is.


Beautiful dress, especially for the price. I ordered the rose gold and I love the color. A little loose up top and long but I’m a curvy petite at only 5’2”. Longer is always better than too short. Gorgeous gown. Love it.


Longer than I would like as I'm 5 foot 1 in but with heels i think it will be okay! fits a little bigger in the chest area than i thought


returned, it was too small but that wasn't its only problem. It was very itchy and it bunched weird in the tummy pleats. Looks beautiful though and I'm sure would be perfect if it fit right.


zipper is a little tough to move up and down, but pleasantly surprised how well it's made for the price.


Really pretty dress, just didn't like the way it hung on my arms.


This dress is absolutely Beautiful.  My bridesmaids will wear this dress in my wedding on June 2, 2018.


I bought this dress for a wedding in the Caribbean and I never tried it on until I had to put it on that morning. It fit like a glove! I got so many compliments and so many people wanted me to give them my dress!


This dress was stunning.  Only problem was it was a bit too long.  For the price, I was expecting a cheaply made flimsy dress.  I would not have minded though as this was only going to be worn once for a Mardi Gras Ball.  I was very suprised at the quality especially for the price.
