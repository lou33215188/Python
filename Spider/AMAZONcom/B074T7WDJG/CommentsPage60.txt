I ordered this dress for a mardi gras ball for Jan 2017.  I got a size 10 and am normally a size 8 but it fit almost perfectly.  This dress was long because I am 5ft 3. But for the price, it's worth it to get it hemmed professionally.  The downside of this dress was the arm holes were kinda small and the sequins immediately scratched my arms, so I'm also get the arm holes opened a little bit more.  It is lined on the inside so the sequins don't scratch you.  You can easily wear a bra with this dress.  The dress is richly sequined, so I think wearing a necklace will be an overkill. I'm going to buy simple ruby/diamond costume earrings and a ruby/diamond  cocktail right and be done with it.


Gorgeous, good fit.  I got so many compliments on it at the Marine Ball!


Prettier in person. Perfect dress, perfect price.


Perfect for my bridesmaids!


For an inexpensive bridesmaid dress, this is perfect in price! Fits great and true to the size chart.


Love, love, love this dress!


This 6 seems more like a 4, Very pretty but the top half is very tight.


Pretty dress but I had a few issues with it. I was really excited but once I received it, severely disappointed. To be clear, I am still finding sequins all over my floor, even though it was put away, days ago. It was an awkward fit. It was way too big in the shoulders and bust. I was scared to zip it because there are so many sequins next to the zipper. I didn't want to break the zipper. Lastly, even though it's only a dollar difference,  I'm being refunded  $46.99 when I paid $47.99.


A lil long but overall beautiful dress!


This dress was perfect for me!
