Bought this for my sister and it fit her beautifully!


Beautiful dress, does run small so size up 1. 3 stars because it is unbearably uncomfortable, which is why I'm returning it.


LOVE this dress, lots of compliments, purchased another in black as well,  it is quite long so be prepared to shorten it!  I am 5'10 and it touches the floor with 1" shoes!!!  Must be dry cleaned and I store it in a clothes protector so sequins don't catch on other clothes.


For the price this dress is amazing. I received many many compliments throughout the night. It's quite long- I'm 5'6 and with four inch heels on it was still too long so I needed it hemmed


too small for size description


Overall, the dress is very nice and shipping was quick. I appreciate that there is fabric over the sequins under the armpit to prevent chaffing. However, the dress is a little tight around the chest and a couple of inches too long for me.


I love this dress so much! It is beautiful for the price! I'm 5'7 and roughly 178 lbs. I went with the size 16 because my bust is a little on the larger side. I can't wait to wear this dress this week


Beautiful Dress, terrible zipper. The zipper wouldn't work, so we had to shimmy her into the dress.


Love this dress. Looks so expensive, but the price was great!


This is a lovely dress and it is long enough which was my biggest fear. There is room enough for me to wear my stilettos. The only problem is that it is scratchy, but I need this for a wedding so I'm gonna try to work around it.
