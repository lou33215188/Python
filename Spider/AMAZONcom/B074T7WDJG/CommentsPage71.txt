The color and sequins are fantastic. Definitely worth the price. Purchased a size 10 but fits more like an 8. Was able to make it work for what I needed. Definitely recommend


This dress is beautiful! I'm 5'7 and 115 pounds and I ordered a size 2 in black. It fits perfectly everywhere (if you have a bigger chest then you might want to go a size up, just my opinion though). It's long enough that I can wear heels but not so long that I can't wear flats with it. The underarms are lined so that the sequins do not rub you. I am 100% satisfied with this dress and I would definitely buy this again and recommend to anyone!!


Absolutely stunning!!! This dress is fabulous....it fits fabulously.....and the sequin shimmer is MAGNIFICENT!!! I received hundreds of wonderful compliments on the dress and my overall look!!! ğŸ¤—ğŸ˜‰ğŸ˜Š


*Side note information*


I am about 5'7 and about 215lbs (38DD) so I got my dress in size 16 dress....perfect fit! I wore this dress to a black tie formal wedding, I paired it with 3.5 to 4 inches heels (can't remember the exact heel height) and my dress still touched the floor which I wanted!!!


Pros:


- Brilliant shimmer factor


- Excellent sequin coverage


- Accurate sizing


- Ample cleavage exposure


- Minimum sequin shedding


- NO sequin chafing in armpit area (nor anywhere)


Cons:


- Zipper sticking when zipping up


- Borderline over exposure in cleavage area


This dress is gorgeous but not too sure if appropriate for the venue....if you are chesty as I am you may have to pin the front....will decide by todays end


We were trying to find dresses as pretty as those we had seen when searching online wedding venues/photos. We originally ordered dresses from anther site. When only 1 of 3 of bridesmaids dresses were going to be shipped in time, I ordered these to match the originals. These were actually a little less expensive than the originals.  The only big difference, which isn't noticeable, was the thickness of the liner on which the sequins are sewed.  Very beautiful dress and much cheaper than bridesmaids dresses in bridal shops.  Prettier too!  It is everything or more in looks that you would want for a special event.  In the attached photo, as you can see, you cannot tell which dress we paid the higher price for.


Received dress in a timely manner.  Was a little on the long side and had to be hemmed but it worked out ok.


I did not like this dress at all.  I purchased it to wear at a black tie work event and I immediately sent it back.  The material was cheap and looked like a costume -- not something to wear to a formal gala.  There is a reason this dress is so inexpensive.


This dress is what dreams are made of! I wore this for the Captains Dinner on a cruise, I cant count how many times I was stopped and complimented!! So well made, and it's GORGEOUS in person. So so happy with this purchase!!


This dress is amazing. True to size and the quality is excellent. I would recommend this dress to anyone. For the price, it exceeds expectation and more. Latoya


This was a pretty dress but a little too many sequins for what I was looking for.
