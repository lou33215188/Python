Great dress!!! 5’2” - 116 lbs - 34DD - size 4. It also fit my friend who is 5’5” - 116 lbs - 34B. Looked very different on both of us, because of where the band under the bust started. If you have bigger boobs, obviously the band is higher up.


Perfect! As described and as ordered.  Thank you!


I needed a bridesmaid dress for my sister's wedding after ordering from an online company, only to have the dress be four sizes too small. This dress fit perfect,cost significantly less, and was true to size with really fast shipping. I was very pleased with every aspect of this purchase.


I was really surprised at the quality of this dress. It's very well made, comfortable and fit just as I expected it to.


No flattering at all. My boobs had nowhere to go, and the size I am in real life is not their interpretation of my size.


I love this dress. I wore it to my babyshower. I received so many complements. I would definitely recommend getting this dress.


This dress is cute but runs a little small. I bought the 8 expecting it to fit and couldn’t get it zippered the whole way. The pleats in the front made it bulk out so I looked like I had a bulging gut. Had to return it unfortunately.


Fit great. I had to get it altered a tiny bit but I didn't expect it to fit like a glove. The sequins come off a lot but not a huge deal.


I love this dress! It's no real lining, so don't expect high quality construction but for the price it's an amazing dress! I'd buy every color if I had enough occasions. I was worried I would need a larger size for my hips and since it was Asian made; but I bought to fit my top half and it fit perfect!


This dress was true to size, just a little to scratchy for me. The length was perfect for my height of 5'7 unfortunately I had  to send it back.
