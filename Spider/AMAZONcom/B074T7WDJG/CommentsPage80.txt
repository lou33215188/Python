Perfect fit!


Amazing dress! Fit perfectly with no alterations. 5'11" about 140, ordered a size 10 and it fit like a glove. So much fun to wear an actual floor length dress without having to do major alterations! Love love it


Fit great! The shoulder straps were a little lose but I'm not really big in the chest so if the next person is that might fix that problem. I love the dress and I really love it for the price! I ordered the dress Sunday and it came today which is a Tuesday and that was great for me bc I needed it by Thursday. It is really long but that's ok overall this was a great purchase for me


Very nice  worked great


I was a bit hesitant to get the dress because I thought the sequins would be too much, but it ended up being a beautiful dress overall! I did have to "size up" but ended up fitting beautifully. I'm about 5'4" and definitely had to get it altered at the hem. Overall, I was very happy with it and I got a lot of compliments.


The dress is beautiful, affordable, and fits great. I ordered it on Wednesday and received it on Friday in excellent condition. Great purchase.


All the girls love their dress we got so many compliments for the dress. Some of the sequins started to come out we didn't care.


I'm putting this review on here for a better size idea for others :) I am 5'7" 138 lbs and got a 4... Its a bit snug but will work! I will wear two inch heels and it will be perfect length!! Amazing dress for the money! Very mermaidesq ğŸ§œğŸ�¼â€�â™€ï¸�


True to size . I was pregnant and it had a ton of room in the stomach !


This dress is super true to size im a 10 to 12 normally ans ordered a 12 to be safe since more formal dressrs generally run small and I could of done a 10 easy. Gorgeous dress for the price.
