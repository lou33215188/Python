Very flattering dress! Stunning color and Stunning!light weight.


I bought it for me but had to give it as present. It was great.


Ordered light gold and got bright flashy yellow.


Love, love, love this dress!  Fits just as expected.  Awesome, blingy dress!!!


Nice fitting dress for the price. Size 12, 175 pounds.


Zipper is very tough when you get to the thick part under the V even when it's on the hanger


Great


I got so many compliments on this dress! Warning bigger busted ladies. I am a 36 F and these don't really leave alot to the imagination. I wore this for a Mardi Gras Ball and loved it but I do wish it would have been not as low cut. I tend to wear less revealing clothing and I normally wear something with sleeves as its my preference, I found that I held my cup in from of my chest most of the night from being self conscious but my husband loved it of course! haha. The stock photo is a little deceiving as the dress comes way lower than that. But overall I LOVE this dress and want one in every color. Its not itchy like alot of sequin dresses are and it didn't aggravate my underarms, a lot of sparkly dresses tend to do this. Great buy for a fantastic price!


Fits perfectly, and it was a great deal for the quality of the dress.


Cute dress with fun design.
