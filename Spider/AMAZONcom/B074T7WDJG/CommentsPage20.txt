Beautiful dress!!!


Ordered up a size and it fit perfectly!


Beautiful dress.  I'm 5'8, 135 (34D) and the medium was a bit long in the over the shoulder part.  I had to get it taken up about 2 inches on each side.  Otherwise stunning. I got compliments all night at a black tie wedding.  Looks very luxe.


This fit great. I got a size 10 and it fit me pretty good for the price Iâ€™m not complaining. Wore it for a wedding


uneven seams and looks somewhat cheap, but a great dress for the price and it actually fits women with large chests! kinda scratchy under the armpits, but not too bad. super appropriate for a black tie event.


too short ., I am 5'8" and wearing this barefoot it was touching the floor no way I could wear this with any type of heels


Got this dress for a semi formal dance.  It fit my daughter perfectly.  The sequins did not bother her arms.


I like the dress! I'm a size 12 and i ordered a size 14 it fit perfectly.


Nice cut of dress with tiny sequins, but a 6 fits like a size 2.  The zipper also came broken (zipped to the top but with bubble in the middle of the zipper than was unzipped)


I don't normally write reviews but thought I would because the reviews helped me tremendously!! I ordered two sizes my size and a size lager per the reviews; I ended up keeping my size because it was more of a true fit for me. -Sizing up made the dress longer and bust area bigger. Overall great dress for the price.


Beautiful dress!!! Just extremley too long. I ordered a Medium and I'm 5'3 and I expected maybe 3-4 inches too long that I could make up with heels but this was close to 10 inches too long.
