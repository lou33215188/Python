Perfect dont ever change. Your seamless services have blessed me beyond measure. Simplifying a tedious task that I now welcome without anxiety or apprehensions. I am a woman of color that in the south that often faces poor service and lack luster respect when entering bridal boutiques and shops. I love to spend and buy when I am appreciated and respected, therefore AMAZON and its world renowned market place has given me immeasurable freadom and self respect as a woman of color. I absolutely Love it. No longer at the mercy of thise that do not want my brown dollar.


I can't say enough good things about this dress. I wore it for our Military ball and got so many compliments. I usually wear a US 12 or XL and that's what I originally ordered but I had to return for a 14 so it would fit in the bust. Other than that zero complaints. Very comfortable and not scratchy under the arms like I assumed it would be.


I purachsed one in rose gold and one in light gold to see which color I liked better for my bridesmaids. The rose gold color is absolutely gorgeous, but the light gold goes better with the rest of my wedding colors. The dress itself is well made and high quality! It is completely lined on the inside to protect your skin from the sequins unlike many other sequin dresses I've seen. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the purchase, and cant wait to see all of my bridesmaids in their dress on my big day! :)


This dress is lovely. I read the reviews and took a chance in buying it and was not disappointed. I am a size 8-10 and that's what I bought a size 10. and it fits perfect. Well except for the bust part. I'm a 36D/38A. And the busts start to become exposed. But I pinned it and wore a jacket and it was fine. A great buy and it came just on time.


Horribly ugly and cheap looking!


I am 5"6 and had a hard time deciding which size to get. My current dress size is a 4 and someone wrote a review with my same dimensions and I'm glad I stuck with a 4. Once I put it on, I had problems getting it zipped up, but with some help it zipped right up and fit perfectly! Made me look amazing and the dress got many compliments!!! I ordered a previous dress on Amazon with great reviews but returned it for this one. Love it so much and want to wear it again! I got rose gold and it was beautiful. Wasn't too pink like the iPhone, more of a "champagne"


This dress is beautiful. Super sparkly and flattering. The rose gold color is gorgeous (I ordered the regular gold too, and the rose gold color is much more complimentary to my skin tone). The only negative is that the armpit area is scratchy (from the other reviews it seems as though this has been addressed by the manufacturer -- and, in fact, the regular gold dress I ordered has the problem fixed by the addition of a thin mesh around the armpit area -- but the rose gold one I received must be an "older model" because it hasn't been fixed. However, it's beautiful, and I'm willing to sacrifice a little comfort to feel pretty in our cruise formal night.


I ordered a sz 6. I'm 5' 6" about 135 lbs, and it fits like a glove.


These dresses were absolutely amazing! I used them as my bridesmaids dresses for my wedding this weekend and they were gorgeous! They photographed just as amazing â�¤ï¸�


I normally don't buy dresses online because I've been very unhappy with the fit/material in the past. I decided to go ahead and take a chance on this sequin stunner because it was so cheap and the reviews were positive. What a pay-off! I'm 5'9" and 200 lbs. Bought the 16 and it is PERFECT! The fit is SO flattering. This dress does NOT look cheap and it is plenty long. I can wear high heels and it will be just barely off the floor. A tall girl's dream! Ha!  Can't wait to dress up and wear this on NYE! ğŸ˜� Picture is of me putting it on straight out of the bag it came in (stuffed in my mailbox)


Used as the Bridesmaid dresses for my wedding. This dress was gorgeous! I LOVED how my girls looked in it! The seller was fantastic to work with too! The free returns for wrong size was amazing, and with it being sold as Prime, it gave me every piece of mind that all was going to go well. Thank you for helping make my wedding exactly as I pictured!
