Bought this dress for a photo shoot. It was better than expected and beautiful and at a great price. I only needed something that looked good on camera but this dress was heavy and had a nice lining and looks great on camera. Good buy overall.


This dress is stunning! I purchased rose gold. I bought it for an upcoming wedding. I followed the size chart from seller and it fit perfect.The length is pretty long. I'm 5'6 and with heels it still sweeps the floor. Overall I'm super happy I found this dress and for this price! I can't wait for the wedding so I can show it off.


I was six months pregnant at the time, it fit me like a potato sack unfortunately! I ordered a medium. Super pretty dress, but I did end up returning it.


I usually wear size 2 and 4, and ordered size 2, but it is too small. I guess size 4 can fit, but I return it anyway.


Beautiful! Canâ€™t beat the price for a MOH dress, got so many compliments!


Runs very small in the bust, and it is really scratchy under the arms. Too bad, because it's really a beautiful dress otherwise!


The dress fits my grand daughter perfectly.It is as described arrived quickly great price. The reason I gave it a 4 is because the sequence fall off easily. I hope they last for the prom. Grandma B


It was a beautiful dress and I received several compliments on it. It was just a little big in the breast area. I ordered a size 10 and 8 would have been better.


The dress was just what I wanted. Not form fitting at the bottom. It was scratchy under the arms because of the sequins, but I expected that from the reviews. I had to pin my cleavage area, but for the ball I attended it was perfect.


Fits great, looks beautiful! I usually am a size 4, but I ordered it in a size 6 based on the size chart listed and it's great, but it's very long and drags. I'm 5'6 and decently petite but it's very long. Will need it hemmed.
