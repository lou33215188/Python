I ordered this dress, I’m a maid of honor in my friends wedding. The Dress was nice. I did notice some sequins had falling off when I tried it on but nothing noticeable. I would purchase again especially for the price. I’ll update after I wear it!


Im so in love with this dress in gold. The dress came fast! Great quality. It fits perfectly but the length is long. Need to be hemmed but overall I would recommend for any special occasion such as a wedding! Will update with pictures later.


Runs small but a very beautiful dress....scratchy though.


Itchy, way to small!


Very  cute dress. The sequins under the arms hurt though and scrape against the area under my arms.


Pretty dress but not long enough. Daughter is 5’10 and with a 2 inch heel the shoe is visible. Will return.


The fit was great. I tried it on before the wedding with what I was wearing under the dress for the day of the wedding. On the day of the wedding, the zipper came off the track before the wedding began. I was very disappointed that the zipper broke.


Beautiful dress. I am 5’9 and it was long enough to still touch the floor. It really really hugs in the back, I wish the back was more flowy like the front. Great dress for the price.


A really, really great dress at an exceptional price!


Unfortunately, this looked more like a costume than a dress :( It also runs pretty small. I was so excited when I had seen the other reviews and pics, but guess this didn't work out for me.
