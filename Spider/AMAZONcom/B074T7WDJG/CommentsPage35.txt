Unfortunately I missed the return window on this purchase. The zippers installed are of very low quality. The fabric is pretty and it has a nice fit but the zipper is bound to break with any given wear. I purchased two of these and each zipper is of the same - going to break soon - quality.


Gorgeous dress for the price! It's absolutely wonderful in fit and style. It is a little bit long but will be perfect with a short heel.


Love it! Super comfy and great for the price-fits me perfectly! It is a little scratchy but hey-that's what you get for wearing sequins :)


I absolutely loved the dress!!! It came in fast and fitted her just right!


The dress is spectacular! It is exactly what we were looking for and fit perfectly!


Great Dress! ğŸ‘�ğŸ˜Š


This dress is beautiful and a great value.


Beautiful.  Based on reviews I ordered one size larger than my dress size and it fits perfectly.  My normal size would have certainly been too small.  Dress is stunning and looks beautiful on, well worth the purchase price!


This dress is not black as advertised. I bought the short black model and the color is light silver. The sequins are the same color as aluminum paper. More astronaut than a cocktail dress... had to return :-(


Amazing, great quality and looks expensive.....this is a steal of a deal
