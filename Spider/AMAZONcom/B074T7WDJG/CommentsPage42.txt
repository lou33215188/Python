I absolutely love lovelove this dress!!! I looked amazing in this dress....


The dress is great quality for the price! The sequins may or may not be an issue depending on your arm shape and it doesn't really stretch. Other than that it's awesome sauce!


ended up returning because not what the bride was seeking however awesome dress esp at the price


Got so many compliments in this dress. Great also for pregnant women!!!!


This is a nice dress, although the sequins fall off as soon as you try it on. After much searching I am going to wear this to my brother's wedding. It doesn't look too cheap.
