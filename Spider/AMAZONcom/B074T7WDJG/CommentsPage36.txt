Perfect brides maid dress. Fits well. Did not need to alter.


Beautiful dress- the only issues are it's way too long and you'll leave a sequence trail wherever you walk. I am 5'1 and even in 6 in heels, it's still 4-5 inches too long.


Arrived really quickly!! Nice gown, for the price.. Be careful of the beading. Very flattering fit for an in-between size 10/12, 5ft.6in, pear-shaped figured Lady! Personally, seems to be an A-Line Dress. Love the color:)


It's a beautiful dress, looks more expensive than what I paid. It's a bit itchy but as expected for sequins


Very Nice dress!  Fit well!


too big but I am pregnant and this was not a maternity dress lol


Dress came on time. Zipper is broken. I can wear it for my event tonight. I'm very upset. Seems like it was returned by someone else and re-routed to me.


Super reasonable price and fast shipping! The sequins seem loose in places but for a bridesmaid dress this will sure do! Sizing was pretty accurate as well. This dress does have at least a little give which makes it comfortable.


Beautiful dress, very bright gold


Size up! I did as a precaution and it fit perfectly. Quality matches the price. Great last minute purchase for a formal event.
