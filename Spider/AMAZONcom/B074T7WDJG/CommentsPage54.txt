Nice quality. I used it for a wedding.


Beautiful and great quality


Very quick shipping! Was exactly as described- so pretty!


True to color....true to size, except in my case, bust is too large so the zip needs to be adjusted. Other than that great dress I am impressed by the quality


This dress is gorgeous! It was exactly what I was looking for, but I cannot give it the full 5 stars because it did not fit perfectly- the straps were a little loose, making a wardrobe malfunction quite probable. To fix this, I tied the straps together on the backside, tightening them. However, this made the fabric too tight on the back of my neck, which gave me a rash by the end of the night. I also had rashes on my arms from them scraping against the sequins. Even so, I give it 4 stars. You'll definitely feel tore up the next day, but it is worth it because it is so pretty!


I was amazed at the quality of this dress. Received many compliments.


I had to order a bigger size. It does not stretch so keep that in mind but its a beautiful dress.


I love this dress! It's lightweight and Airy and it's just perfect for me!


I was Hollywood Glam in this dress. I ordered a size up and it was a little snug I wore a smoother underneath and it did the trick


Beautiful dress but it was much shorter in the back than expected.
