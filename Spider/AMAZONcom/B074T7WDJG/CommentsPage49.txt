Sadly it came with sequins missing st the bottom, beautiful dress fit well!


Beautiful dress. I lost a bit of sequins but not enough to take away from the look of the dress. Lots of cleavage but that's to be expected


Bad zipper sizing not true beautiful dress


Really low quality- falling apart already and we just got it tried on will return if possible


Cute dress. Not good quality, but you get what you pay for. Sequins were everywhere! Before the night was over we had patches missing.


I'm usually a dress size 14 but I ordered a 16. I wish I would of ordered a 14 because it was true to size. I am only a B cup so the chest was way to big but it's something I am used to. Great quality and would recommend!


Chest area is cut SUPER small and it has zero give. I have a larger rib cage and bigger boobs so I couldnt even get this half way zipped. The skirt was very flattering from what I could tell. Not too long. No way this is a true size '14'. While the sequins were beautiful from afar they were very itchy to wear especially under the arms.


Not worth the $50 I paid. $40 would have been a better price. I recommend ordering at least 2-3 sizes up if you have a larger rib cage/bigger boobs. Unfortunately I do not have time for a reorder to come in so I will just be returning this one.


Very well made! Fit as expected and was easy to hem. Was very comfortable.


Love this dress, a size 4 fit perfectly (120lbs and 5ft 6in). I do have to wear a 1.5-2 inch heel so the bottom of dress doesn't drag on ground.


Exceeded my expectations!! Beautiful dress, I will buy again.
