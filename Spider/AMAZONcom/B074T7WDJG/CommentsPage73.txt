Love the look and feel of this dress. Pretty well made for the price. I'm very busty so I purchased according to my chest size but will have to have it taken in some before my best friend's wedding. Can't wait to wear it next month!


Too small and too short. DEFINITELY DOES NOT HIT THE FLOOR. Sent i5 back. Won't order from them again.


Its a beautiful dress but it was huge on me.


Nice dress but was way too long for me. The sequins does get caught a lot.


For a dress like this one would usually expect to pay $90+, because of its fit and quality. I ordered it as a prom dress and it looks amazing on and fits very well.


This dress was beautiful but it was a little tight under my arms so sadly I had to return it. I ordered a M. I am 5'7 1/2 140lbs 34DD. The length was perfect but it may need to be altered if your shorter. I give it 5 stars because it was a high quality dress. But mostly because of the seller. I ordered my dress on a Friday, received it on a Sunday. Contacted the seller on Monday to receive return instructions. I shipped the dress back on Tuesday and the money was back in my account by 8pm that same day. Great great customer service. I will be buying more in the future.


Great dress for the price! Comfortable. A little big in the chest (I am a 36Ddd) and long.


I am 5'5" 190 pounds. The size 12 fit perfectly - almost as if it was tailored just for me. It's just a little long but perfect with some heels. Do yourself a favor and buy this dress. It is not cheap looking at all and absolutely stunning on! I feel like a princess - Love love love!!!!!


It's too shiny & it looks cheap


Looks different than illustration
