It fit perfect and I got a lot of compliments on this dress. I bought in Black color.


The sequins fall off with any movement of the dress.


Nice dress for the price


This dress will be the perfect dress for my bridesmaids! Its cute, not overly sparkly, and priced very fair. Its a bit more gold than the photo. The photo here looks like it has some silver in it but its just the shine/glare. Most of my bridesmaids found that it fit a bit small. For example, my size 4 friend felt that while the size 4 fit her, the size 6 fit better. If you have a bigger chest you may want to size up for that reason as well. The sequins do fall off a little (very little), so we are keeping them in their storage bags until the week of the wedding to prevent more shedding.


The price is amazing and the dress fit great!


This dress fit perfect and came just in time for my formal event! I got lots of compliments!


Beautiful gown, I did not like the look on me.


Nice dress- good value


They are beyond beautiful. Absolutely amazing.


The dress is beautiful and the length is perfect for a wwoman 5' 8".  However, I  agree with the other person who mentioned the arm holes being small. They were a tad tight which caused the sequins to scratch my skin.  With that said, I took it to my seamstress and she's making the are hole bigger.  The one complaint I have is the zipper.  Because it's hidden, it catches on the sequins and they fall off but it's not noticeable.
