Bought to wear to an event I sized up just in case the dress was loose every where except the waistband which was sewn much smaller then it should have been I ended up having to return the dress the sequins also fell off a lot upon taking it out of the bag and I’d say the rose gold isn’t a true rose gold color more of a copper


Very nice. Just right.


Beautiful dress just Cut small


I am 5'&7", 140 lbs.  The dress was beautiful for the price, but I returned it.  First, the zipper would not go all the way down due to the sequins and I did not want to force it and rip it.  It did go down far enough to slip it over my head, instead of stepping into it.  The fit under the arms was just enough to make the sequins very uncomfortable,  Add to that all and if I'd have kept it, I would have had to had about 4 inches hemmed as I an NOT a stiletto wearer.  Best to return and try again.


Great dress for what I needed it for.


dress runs small


Great dress! Highly recommend


love it!


The dress is really pretty but downright painful to wear! Before I even got it all the way zipped up, my underarms were raw from rubbing on the sequins.


Fits great.  Very beautiful!
