This dress is INCREDIBLE. The fit is stunning. The arms are itchy, but that's always the case with sequins. I got loads of compliments wearing it to the theater last night. It's my new favorite dress.


This dress was MAGNIFICENT!! It fit great! I'm 5'1 170 pounds and ordered a 16, I did have to take 3 in off the hem but other than that it was great. It's big in the chest area but I'm a 38 D and filled it in just right. And the price?!?! I would have paid well over $200 retail for this gown. It's perfect.


I bought the red and it fit exactly as expected.  The dress is a good quality and the color is quite nice.  I really love the way this dress looks on me, and I'm so excited to wear it!!


I'm 5'4, 115lbs, 34x25x38 and size 4 was a  perfect match. I'm giving it 4 stars because the zipper is hard to close.


This dress is pretty but was painful after awhile. It began to scratch my right arm up and today I still have a rash from wearing this dress. I used two sided dress tape to keep my boobs in place. Overall it's a good dress.


Very nice dress for the price, is a lil long but fits as expected...


Looks exactly how pictured so pretty sequins galore


I ordered size 16 5'9 235 though I wear 14-16 but I am a 42 DD so the v neck is pretty low but overall the dress is wonderful


I originally purchased a 10 according to the size chart but returned and got the size 8. The 8 fit much better, snugged in the right places and shouldn't be too long for heels. The 10 was too long even with heels. Can't wait to wear this beauty in my friends wedding!


This was the perfect dress. From the fit to the length everything was great. Did not give them 5 stars because the gold color was a tad bit lighter than I thought. However it worked perfectly.


This dress is just what I was looking for. The size is perfect according to the size chart, and well made. Good material and craftsmanship. I am just so pleased with this dress.
