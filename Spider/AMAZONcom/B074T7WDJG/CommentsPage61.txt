Love this dress!


Gorgeous but just a little tighter than a normal 4! Just will have to lose a few pounds before the wedding nbd ğŸ˜Š


BEAUTIFUL BUT TO SMALL FOR ME GREAT DRESS.


Dress run small than size


Pretty though.


it was a beautiful dress, but ran very, very, very, small


This dress is really very pretty for the price.


I'm 5'8" and this just barely touched the ground.


I like my dress, it fit me well


Ordered at 16 and it fits perfect! Front chest fabric is not sewn together and that would be my only issue, but it's an easy fix.


I'm 5'6" and 130 lbs and I ordered the size Small, which fit perfectly, but was too long.


PROS:


â€¢ lovely gold color that sparkles A LOT


â€¢ flattering fit that is figure-hugging


â€¢ pleats around the waist hide the midsection a bit


CONS:


â€¢ even just trying on the dress, it lost a lot of sequins â€” it might have just been one loose strand that caused this, but I ended up returning the dress because I didn't want to worry about getting up from a formal dinner and leave sequins behind on the chair


â€¢ very long, so leave enough time for hemming unless you are tall or plan on wearing very high heels
