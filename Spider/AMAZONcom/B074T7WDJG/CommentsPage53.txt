Way too small. I’m a size 4 and wear a 34C and the medium was way too small, couldn’t zip it


Love it!!! Comfortable and gorgeous! Sequins does fall off so handle with care, but it is overall amazing!


I was pleasantly surprised that the dress fit and looked as pictured. I am 5'8" and I loved the fact that I was able to wear heels and still have a floor length dress. The dress wasn't supposed to be in stock for a few days and I ended up receiving it a few days prior to the in stock date they stated. I was pleasantly surprised! The only negative is that the zipper did catch around the waist band when trying to unzip or zip up the dress and the dress would sometimes snag on itself. Altogether, I was really pleased with the purchase and the company and I will most definitely buy from them again!


I purchased this for my daughter. The dress is beautiful. Looks better in person. A lot of bling for the price.


Very pretty dress. Recieved lots of compliments. Fit is as expected


Nice dress for the price, but too tight in bust area, not very forgiving is you have larger bust.


The material was very uncomfortable


The dress is nice but doesn’t fit and I need to return it. Please tell me how


Just slightly too small around the chest area.


The dress looks exactly as advertised. The sizes do run smaller. Usually I am a size 2, but after reading other reviews I took the chance of ordering a size 4 and it fits perfectly. Is a little long so unless you're expecting to wear tall heals you will probably need it hemmed. It does not look cheap, and is great quality for the price paid.
