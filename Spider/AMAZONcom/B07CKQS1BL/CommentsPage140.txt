Adorable dress!! Fit great!


Love it!!


I love it!


I like the stamp album.


I thought I could use the ink cartdrige since its cheaper than anew one, but I guess it didn't work.  It could be defective, ink already dried out.


Dress did not fit.


ninja swing and diggys adventure I did not order. and I hope I don't receive them


I love the fabric choices on this dress but have to send it back.


It fits fine and is comfortable but the top is really really short. This could look proportionate and cute as long as you're petite.


I'm 5'10" with 36Dd and the look just didn't work on me. Ends up looking like you pulled your skirt up to under your arm pits!


Just got my dress, I ordered a 3x and it fits perfectly...I'm soooo in love with it. The material is so soft and with summer coming this dress is going to be a hit. This dress will make any woman, regardless of size, look amazing.


I'm buying more right now.


Left a blue residue on my scalp no matter how much I rinsed. Also didn't see much of an affect on my color


My husband got me this dress as a birthday present. It fit fine, but the fabric was thin and my nude bra still was very visible. Also at 5'11" the skirt was more mini skirt length and not really appropriate to wear to work.


I love my dress and just got today. After trying I already ordered  Second one in different color. I am 5â€™7 and 145 . I order medium, not too tight and not too loose on me . Just perfect size and length .


Love â�¤ï¸� The dress
