I loved this dress so much I got it in four different colors. I'm short and on the small side and these fit perfect, they're comfortable and cute!


The look and color of the dress is perfect. Cannot ask for more for the current price. I am 5' 4'' and ordered small size .It fits perfect.


I never thought the dress would come out to be this good.I am getting lots of compliments for the dress. In love with the dress.


TOO SMALL


BAH!  I used the guide to buy the dress and it is just way too big in the waist!  I tried to pair it with a belt and then it looked bunchy at the waist so I am going to have to return it.


Bought this to wear to a work tea party and it was a hit. Love it.


Very comfortable and flattering. I bought 2 different colors. A modest but yet stylish dress. Great for church, work.


I am 240 lbs, 5'10" and curvy and the 2XL fits like a glove. I always find it hard to find a dress that is long enough on me and this is the one! :)


I absolutely love this dress and will probably be buying another one in the near future.


I really like this dress. I bought a large and I usually wear size 10. I am 5'6 and the length of the dress is perfect going just a little under the knee. Prefer for work! The fabric is high quality and the print is adorable. I liked so much that I bought the same dress for my friend.


It's pretty, it's comfy, it fits well, and it has pockets!  I love you.


It is my signature print, I couldn't be happier especially the material.
