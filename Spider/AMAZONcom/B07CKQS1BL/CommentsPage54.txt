This fit my daughter exactly as we hoped. She is tall and the dress does come just to her knees or a little below - hard to find when you have long legs


Good quality material and sticking.  Would buy again


Really cute dress but flares out too much for me. I have wider hips so this dress made my butt look 2 feet wide! I wanted to love it. Such a cute design.


I'm so in love with this dress it's so beautiful! And I love the fabric feel of it! Very cozy. I totally recommend it!


I love this dress. It has pockets! Very forgiving, modest length and neckline. Thicker material on top as well.


I love this dress! Fits wonderfully (I bought a medium and am generally a size 6-8), very comfortable and it has pockets!! The only thing I personally don't like is the top half is a very thick material, so it's hard to wear in the summer here in Arizona. Overall I am very happy with it, and have gotten numerous compliments!


I was actually pleasantly surprised with the fit and quality of this dress. I am 5’4 and 125 ibs and the size small fits perfectly! Great dress for work or wedding for an even better price. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a fun dress to enhance your wardrobe.


This product fits beautifully, however, I ordered the rose red.  It is supposed to be a nice pink color with pink roses on a black background on the skirt.  I was sent a dress that has a black top and several different colored flowers, none of which are pink, in the skirt.  It’s very disappointing because even the tag says rose red...???


I am a US size 6-8 so I ordered a large.  Fits perfect.  Even has pockets.  Material is nice.


Too big. I am always a medium, but the medium is way big so it is very unflattering.
