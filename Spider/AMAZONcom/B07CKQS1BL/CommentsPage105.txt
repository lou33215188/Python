I’m 5’5”, 160 lbs, and I usually wear a medium. I ordered a medium in this dress, and it fits great! Perfect for family occasions and work!


Very pretty.


Arrived quickly, very cute, fit according to the chart.


Love this dress! Fits perfectly and I didn't have to go up a size. It is very flattering!


It fit great, it looked great, it felt great. I am in love!


I wore the blue floral dress to my daughter's Catholic baptism, and received so many compliments! With clothes now, it can be difficult to follow all the acceptable dress codes, which you don't want to break on your daughter's baptism day (especially in front of your husband's very Italian family). My shoulders were covered, the length was to my knees, it wasn't too sexy (it was modest, yet not outdated), and the neckline was appropriate. It was absolutely perfect. It was SO much more difficult finding something for myself to wear than I had anticipated! I really wish someone would've just recommended this to me from the beginning, so I'm hopefully doing it for you!!


It's also made of quality material and is not paper-thin like some clothes you can buy online.


I am a size 2 (32 C) and the small fit me perfectly. I absolutely love it.


Good quality. Wish I had gone one size up because it's almost too tight in my shoulders and Chest. I sized up from what I usually get and I'm glad I did because it is still a little snug


I gained weight so right now I'm a 16/18. I ordered a 3x and it fits good. Great stretch. I'm tall, about 5'11 6'ft and it stops exactly at my knees


This dress is SO pretty, and it fits perfectly. I get lots of compliments whenever I wear it.


Just got it today. Fits perfect and looks great. Very comfortable. I am about 5’6” , 250lbs, and wear a 44F the 3x fit great. Sits past the knees. The material is stretchy.
