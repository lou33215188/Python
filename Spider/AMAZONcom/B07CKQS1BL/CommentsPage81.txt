Not that great for women with bigger hips. I returned it. But its not the dresses fault.


Really loved it. Perfect size.


Such a cute dress! I love the fit. I get compliments every time I wear it! It can be worn for every season... Add some tights and a sweater for the winter.


Super cute dress


Vey comfort


I was really impressed with this dress! It’s surprisingly comfortable and is a very flattering silhouette. I’m 5’4 about 210lbs and apple/pear shape. I got the XL and it was perfect. Highly recommend!


Awesome


Nice for the occassion


Complements all the time. Very cute


Bought this dress for work and I'm absolutely in love. Was worried that I wouldn't like the dress but I was so wrong!!!!!!!!
