Such a cute dress and great material. But returning it because it just doesn't fit my body type. I'm short waisted


This dress is adorable!! The fit is true to size and the material was very comfortable.  I loved the design and I received multiple compliments throughout the day, I will definitely be buying more of these dresses in different designs.


Love this dress and it got so many compliments. Its very pretty and feels like decent quality material. It is really adorable!


I get a lot of compliments on this dress.  I probably could have gone a size smaller cause it is really loose


Terrible fit. Bad quality. I wish I did not buy.


The fit and look of this dress is phenomenal! I love it and will be buying it in other colors! I highly recommend this dress! Super cute :)


This dress fits me perfectly!  I am a size 12 dress normally and based on other reviews I bought a large size.


I love this dress. It's super flattering and I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it!


Plus, it has pockets!!!


Absolutely stunning and true to size.


This dress was super cute but it fit really small at the top. I couldn't even fit my shoulders and arms in the sleeves.
