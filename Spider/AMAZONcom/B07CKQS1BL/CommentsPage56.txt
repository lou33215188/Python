Ordered a Medium but the tag says Small so I was definitely leary. Tried it on though and it fit perfect so I didn't bother to complain or return it. I'm 5'5" about 160ish lbs and it fits perfectly! I will definitely be purchasing more (just hope when I order a small I don't get a large).


Fits well. It isn't structured, but just nylon-ish material. Also, it is more of an empire waist. the black material ends just under my bust.


Material look cheap it only look nicer on the pic


Love this dress.  It is so comfortable.  I added a belt to add some color, but its fine on its own as well.


I gave one star because it is a lovely dress. However, when I received it and put it on, I saw that there were many snags in the skirt part of the dress. I have since returned it.


The dress is gorgeous, fits great, and has pockets. the only thing that couldâ€™ve made it better was a double layer on the entire top versus just the neckline.


I absolutely love this dress! I bought this for a wedding and a pair of tan heels to go with it. I got complimented all evening! It is a great quality dress for a very reasonable price. I need more weddings to go to so I can wear it again!!!


I ordered a size up and holy cow I'm swimming in it. It's super cute but I'm going to have to modify it somehow to feel comfortable in this in public.


love this dresa, versatile.  wore to work conference and also to the ballet


Definitely one of the best dress i've ever had, i'm 5'11" and i bought size XL; is super comfy, classy and true to size; i used it for my university graduation and i was flawless with it, recommended 100%!!!!
