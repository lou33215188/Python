I absolutely love this dress. I have been wearing it a lot, and the quality is really great. I was a little skeptical about ordering clothes from Amazon, but I love this dress so much that I ordered another one with a different pattern. It's awesome! Also, it fit really well so just get the size you usually get.


Great dress with POCKETS! This fit perfectly with extra room. It cleans super easily. Great dress can be formal or a work dress.


The dress is beautiful not too heavy and very comfortable would buy again!


Very comfortable! Very fitting without the uncomfortable fabric rubbing against you all day. I am 5"0" and the length is perfect. It makes my waist look smaller which is a good thing for most women! I always get compliments when I wear it and the best part is it has pockets. I work in marketing and it is handy to have pockets to put my keys in without weighing down the dress. I plan on buying it in most colors!


Cute and comfortable, and it has POCKETS! What more Do you need?


Very pretty and really nice quality for the price. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the pattern too.


Fits true to size. I love the material. It is soft and comfy. Not too thick that it makes you hot.


No good for short people. I'm 5'0 and this looked horrible.


Beautiful dress. I ordered a medium. I am 5ft and 138lbs. Medium was a perfect fit for me. I plan on ordering more dresses.


I bough a large and it fit just right! I normally wear a medium so I recommend going one size up! Super cute and comfortable!!
