Love this dress! Fits perfectly! Thank You!


Super cute!!!!!  Nice soft material.


I’m a curvy person and this dress is flattering. Very comfortable.


It's super cute and classy. I ordered an XXL, I wear a 16-18 US and this fits great.


The material is scratchy and just felt cheap. I returned it.


Beautiful dress! Great quality. I wish I liked their other patterns more because I would buy this again!


Nice dress...quality fabric


Very pretty


Loved this dress. It’s good material and the dress I got is the polka dot one. It was a perfect fit, true to size. I’m 145, 5’3”, and the medium fit perfect.


a bit snug at bust. I am 5/9 and 36DD.
