fits perfectly and the material is good quality loved it


Runs way big. Had to return.


The fabric was surprisingly nice. Arms are pretty slim, but the dress doesn't feel cheap. Nice purchase.


I like it but it runs small!


The quality is wonderful for the price. You won't be disappointed.


I ordered this dress in a Small. It was adorable and so comfortable but the sleeves were so baggy on me. If you have skinny arms don't order this. I was very sad to return it :(


Loved it. Fit perfectly, it was super comfortable, and I got a ton of compliments on it. I'm 5'3 and a bit curvy and the large was great. I am buying 2 more in different colors.


Fits me great and the material is really nice. The length is perfect ( right at the knee )


Perfecg fit and very flattering.


Unfortunately I ordered an xlarge when I intended to order a large but the top part was not much bigger. I tried the dress on and fell in love with it. It's a stunning piece.
