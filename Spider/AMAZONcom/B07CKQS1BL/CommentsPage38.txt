Lovely dress but runs small! Read the reviews and bought xxl even though my actual size is large.. still extremely tight around the chest, shoulder and arms. Bought it for Easter but returning it so disappointed.


Good quality material but yet light weight. The material also has some stetch to it. Fits as expected. when it came I was expecting it to be super wrinkled but I actually didn't even need to iron it. I would definitely buy it again.


A little big but I could belt it without it looking bunched or mismatched, a huge plus for me. I'm 5'2" and 105lbs and most stuff tends to be big so I was expecting to end up returning but it looks great with a belt. Comfortable and higher quality than I was expecting and the skirt is a good length.


Cute dress. I’m usually between a size M or L. Due to reviews I purchased an L but I could’ve deft fit in M due to material being stretchy.


It's a great dress for the price, and I really do like it. Others have had great experiences with the size, but not I. The top half does have some stretch to it, but I also felt like I was a she-hulk about to rip through it.


Per my wife, the picture makes it look a little longer than it is on her, but it still fits ok. I think she looks super cute in it. She says the fabric is soft and very comfortable.


Incredibly comfortable, fits just about perfectly and appears to be a low maintenance dress (wrinkles fall away etc.)


I love this dress! I want to buy another color as well. It has pockets! ❤️❤️❤️ VERY good quality/thick material. Well worth the price.


It’s nice and fits as expected - love that there’s pockets too! But I wish I had considered a different pattern instead because I can’t help but laugh at myself when I put it on since the dots are so similar to Minnie mouse’s skirt (at least it’s not red!)


This dress is so thick. It almost felt like putting on a full coat. Too warm for Texas.
