Beautiful dress for a nicer occasion. Fits well, feels nice.


Fits exactly as expected. Really cute and very flattering dress!


Cute dress but short waisted, had to return as waist was at bottom of my boobs. I am  5'4" 36d


Awesome dress! Looks fantastic! Plus, the material is perfect for traveling! No ironing required! Plus nice respectable length! Great!


This is the most adorable dress.


Love


Love this dress! I'm 5'8" and sometimes have a hard time finding dresses long enough for work. This one falls right below my knees, and it fits perfectly. I want this dress in every color, it looks so cute and is really comfortable.


I may have been happier with smaller size. I think this dress runs true to size.


Cute, comfortale


It's beautiful. I usually wear size XL. The length is perfect and it's stylized on the front.  A little tight in the arms but not uncomfortable.
