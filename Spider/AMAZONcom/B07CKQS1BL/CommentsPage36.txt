Torso was too short and dress felt half size too small


Very unflattering on me. High wasted top made skirt poof over hips and I looked huge. Disappointing.


I love this dress it is so comfortable and fits as expected.


I bought this for my 5’4”, 130 lb daughter.  It’s her favorite dress and she could live in it.  Fits comfortably and has pockets!  Who could ask for anything more!


It's a great fit. I like the way it fits close at the top and then kicks out nicely at the bottom. This is actually my third dress. I have 2 other patterns. L lI've them so much I had to get another.  I'm a size 20 and the 3X fits beautifully.


The decoration on the skirt is a dark blue, NOT black as described, but I still love it.  Do wish it was black, but not worth returning it over.


One of the pockets was sew shut, the other pocket was ripped.  The quality is poor at best. Will never buy again just upset with myself I missed the return window.


Bought this for a date this weekend. It's adorable. I'm 5'3" 150lbs, normally a 12 in pants, but an 8/10 in a dress- which I guess would usually be a medium. I ordered the large to be safe and it fits perfectly. I think the medium also would have been fine.


This is much brighter than the picture. I would say the dress is royal blue and much prettier in person. The top is well done and the bottom (the skirt) is a very nice fabric but somewhat sheer meaning I'll have to wear a slip but this is a very cute and flattering dress. I usually wear a medium but I read the comments and sizes up and do not regret it. I might have been able to squeeze in a medium but this is a more comfortable,  casual fit. Very excited about wearing this!!


I LOVE this dress.  It is extremely comfy, classy, and it has pockets.  Not tiny pockets either; enough room for your cell, plus pen, mints etc.  Bought this in another color too.  I get compliments on it whenever I wear it!
