This dress is super cute. I received several compliments and request for the website. The torso is no as long as it shows on the model, it’s much hugher.


It fits great, is super comfortable, and after several washes/wears it's still in great shape! Love this dress.


I’ll order more!  Loved the fit and style


There is nothing that I don’t like about this dress. It’s wonderful to have pockets, and the color is exactly as shown.


This dress is perfect for the pear shaped curvy girl. Ordered large and it really is a 10/12 so perfect with the pockets. One of my favorites!


Got lot of complements! Would purchase again. I'm 5'6 and 147lbs bought a medium. Fit perfectly!


Beautiful dress but a little small


Fit was perfect.  The pockets are a bit smaller than expected.


I really like how the dress fits!


thanks,
