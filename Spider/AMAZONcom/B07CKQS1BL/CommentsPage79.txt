cute and casual


Love it!! My only concern is itâ€™s longer than what it looks in the picture. Iâ€™m 5â€™3â€�. Nevertheless, a 2 inches foot wear made the look fantastic!


Gorgeous dress


It is a beautiful dress. The material is kind of heavy. Good for winter.


I Love this dress!!! I received so many compliments on the colors and style at work. By the looks in the picture I thought it would be a heavy dress but pleasantly it wasn't. I usually wear a size 14/16 since I am pretty busty (38 DD) and 185 lbs and 5'4" tall. This dress fit beautifully. The pockets are my very favorite part of the dress!!!! Has a vintage feel to it. â�¤ï¸� The material is not great quality though. But still beautiful.


So comfortable and made of quality material.
