Oxiuly dresses never seems to fail me... excellent dress, good material.. great fit... absolutely love it!


Bought two different sizes one for my daughter, one for my wife, both fit perfectly.


I absolutely LOVE this dress! It is not as "poofy" as it looks in the pic and the fabric is thinner on the print part than I expected, but it's very flattering and... has pockets :)


Ready to buy this in another color!


I got the blue. It really is lovely!


Beautiful dress and fits so great!!


The material was not what I expected. It was cheaper and the seam where the top meets the skirt was very evident. I ended up returning it.


I'm obsessed with this dress - It's a little long on my 5'1" frame, but that's something I'm used to.  I receive so many compliments every  time I wear it.


I'm in love with this dress!!! I will be ordering in more colors for sure!


Waaaay to big!!!! It was returned the same day we received it. Not impressed :(


I love this dress. I'm tall and for most dresses I don't feel comfortable with wearing no stockings or tights but this dress is long enough and flares out just enough that I can.


Stitching was undone on sleeve, returned
