Perfect fit for my daughter who will be doing her teaching internship next semester!  It's quite comfy as well as stylish!


Very soft and comfortable, good for work with a cardigan. The top is a bit thin but the shirt is a good heavy weight. I wear it without a crinoline.


It fit way to tight on the top, and fit like a tent on the bottom it fits more luke a maternity dress.


I LOVE IT!!! Not only was it beautiful, it fit perfectly. I don't wear dresses for the fact that I'm short and they look funny on me, but this one is perfect! It went to the bottom of my knees like in the picture, so now I'm going to have to buy one in every style (hahaha!!)!


Nothing like the picture. Color is different and shape is different. Not flattering at all!! I wish


I had returned it.


Fits perfectly, and it has soft material. Iâ€™m 5â€™8â€� and I weigh about 175 lbs, and the medium fit me great. I was looking for a dress that is at my knees and this one was perfect for me. The colors are vibrant!


It's a beautiful dress and very well made. The material was good quality. I used the sizing chart according to bust size. I am a 38" bust and chose XL to make sure that I had plenty of room in that area. Sadly it didn't, but my daughter tried it on and it fits her perfectly and she's a 36" bust.


So be careful of the sizing.


The collar is a tag weird, but I got over that really quick. I wore this to work today (teacher) and I got a ton of compliments! It was comfy too! And I love the pickets!


Nice quality and material. Was a beautiful dress because it was very big. I get a size medium usually and this felt like a large.


I love this dress!! Great quality and great length & fit!!
