good


Cute but I didn't like the fabric. Felt like a really thick polyester. I returned mine.


Beautiful dress; well made.


This dress is amazing. Really soft material and stretchy. I'm usually a size 12 with a 38C bust and I ordered a XL, with stretch I could have gone to a large. Buying two more colors.


looks good on me


A great dress. i love the material but its somewhat big than i expected but am keeping it anyways.


Cute print, but the bodice seemed short, the length of the dress is shorter than shown, and despite using the size guide to order, it was so tight as to be very unattractive and not comfortable to wear..


love it!


Too big! Lose on the sleeves not flattering. Itâ€™s nice tho


My wife just bought this for a wedding. She said she made sure to read the reviews first. Dress is a little snug in the arms if u have bigger arms.shes 5'2 so it's obviously a little long on her. But it looks great.
