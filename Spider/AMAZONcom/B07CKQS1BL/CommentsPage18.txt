Super pretty! I love the pattern and color! I got a lot of complements on it at work!


I'm normally an XL in most things, I bought a 2XL and the bottom half was very roomy! The top half was somewhat tight. I'm a 38DDD. I'll for sure buy another one in a different color.


Incredibly well made for the price. Love the for and got lots of compliments. God my mom belly well too! Size 16-18, DDD.


I love this dress! It fits me perfectly.


For reference I am:


5'4"


146 lbs


34C


I bought a size medium and it is very comfortable! Very well made dress. I bought a second one of these dresses in a different pattern.


This dress is so cute!  I was skeptical buying a dress off Amazon, fearing the fabric would be really thin or the dress would be cheaply made.  Luckily, it was neither of those things! The dress fits exactly as the measurements suggest and the fabric is heavy enough to drape nicely.  It fits great around the bust(has a little stretch, so if youâ€™re well endowed, no worries ğŸ˜‰) and then flares, so if youâ€™re self-conscious about your tummy area, this dress is perfect!


Loveeeeeee this dress! Wore it for Thanksgiving and received so many compliments!!! Fits so well, true to size! Amazing material, I never would of believed it was a good quality dress from the price but I will definitely buy more!!!


I bought the large cause I read that it ran small but I wish I bought my size which is medium. I had to go to the tailor to get it take in a bit, maybe it is cause my breasts are not on the large size lol. Anyways this dress is really pretty, got lots of compliments. I may buy another colour again.


This dress was awesome!  I read through almost every review, and I ordered a large and an extra large.  I am 5'5" and I weight 188 currently.  I fit a size 12/14 pants depending on stretch. This dress was great and I feel like I can continue to wear it as I continue to lose baby weight.  I sent the XL back.  I highly recommend this dress.  The material is great and it looks higher quality than the cost.


Wow!! This dress is beautiful and when I saw that it had pockets, I fell even more in love with this dress! The fit is perfect and the measurements given were just right. I was on the hunt for a dress to wear in the fall/winter time and looks like this dress will be really nice for when fall/winter comes (and I'll probably wear some black fleece tights underneath for extra warmth).


I'm 5'0 (and the dress hits to about the middle of my legs, but I love it and just what I was looking for). Also, I'm pretty big on top (36 DD) and I ordered a large (L) and the fit overall is great!


I was not expecting this dress to be so well made, but IT IS! The top part of the dress is pretty thick, which is very nice and it does have a little "give/stretch" to it. And the bottom part (the pattern part) of the dress is a little see through, but nothing a black or white slip can't fix. Also, the bottom part of the dress is very soft, but again VERY well made dress! And the last thing that I really love with this dress is the back zipper which makes putting on the dress very easy!


Definitely will be purchasing another dress design from this seller! :)


I haven't worn a "dress" in years- I wanted to branch out a little from my typical blouse/skirt combo so I thought I would give this a shot.  I loved it from the moment I put it on!  It fit perfectly (I got a 2xl- 5'5" 190 lbs with broad shoulders).  It fit beautifully and I love the pockets!  I was surprised at how comfortable it was- I will be buying another one in a different color.


I was disappointed with this dress.  It looked nice in pictures, but the fabric was incredibly tacky looking. (Think 70s double knit.)  Perhaps it was the color/pattern I ordered.  Also, I sized up to a large and the back gaped at the top and the skirt was too voluminous.  I'm a 36D and pear-shaped.  If you're a bit smaller chested and/or fairly fit, I wouldn't size up.
