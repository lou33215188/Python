I really like this dress. So much that I bought them in different colors. It is so very comfortable and love the pockets. I ordered it large and it fit perfect.


The dress is cute and we'll made. I went a size up based on the reviews but the arms run small as well. I hate I'll have to return it because a bigger dress would be way too big but I arms are very uncomfortable it in.


This Dress is beautiful and it has POCKETS!!! I tried it on the moment I got it and cant wait to wear it to work on Monday!


I'm so upset. I wore this for the first time today and some of the threading came out in front of the dress. So disappointed because I loved the look of this dress.


This dress is sooo cute!  It would get 5 stars if it was as long as it is in the picture.  I don't have long legs, but this hits a little above my knees.


Very nice dress! I'm 5'7 162lbs. Large breasted (36 ddd) so ordered XL. Glad I did. A red belt or scarf around waist would be pretty!


Dress fits greats. I’m a size 4 and small fits but a little loose. If you’re a size 0/2, will be a little in the chest and longer skirt unless you’re tall


I love it!


Love, love, love this dress.  Have two now.  So stylish, comfortable and we'll made


Fit was good, just wasn't a fan of the colors - made it look a little too cheap. The waistline was also rather scratchy, and I wasn't a fan of all the polyester.
