It is so cute and so modest.  Don't have to wear a slip under it which is a bonus.  It is darling.


I absolutely love this dress. It fits perfect for someone my size and height. I am a size 12 and am 5' 4". I love the no iron material, the colors are very vibrant and true to picture, and the pockets are big enough to fit my Galaxy Note phone. I will definitely order another!


Cute dress. The solid part of the dress (bodice, I think) is made with heavy material. I will have to wait for fall/winter to wear this one. Nicely constructed though.


Lighter material than I expected but will work out well for the church event for which I need it.


Love these dresses!


Can’t say enough good things about this dress! It fits like a dream and is so comfortable, plus it has pockets! I’ve gotten many compliments on it and everyone asks where I got it.


I did not like the material on the top portion. It was too clingy and showed back and bra bumps


Great material and colour in person.  Fits great everywhere but shoulders, which were so tight I couldn't get it zipped all the way up.  I have somewhat broad shoulders but have never had something fight so small in the shoulders compared to the rest of the outfit before.


Very comfortable, fits fine. (5'4", 110 llbs). Length is work appropriate but a bit long.


While it did fit, I felt it wasn't as flattering.


It made me look even larger than I actually am.


Perhaps in the future I ought to consider  the style


before purchasing.
