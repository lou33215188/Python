I got so many compliments when I wore this! It makes me feel like an elementary school art teacher in a good way.


I love the dress, but it is a bit on the small size.  I ordered an extra-large, and it fits more like a petit large.  I love the dress, but it is a bit smaller than expected.


LOVE this dress. It is so worth the price. Super comfy and love the pockets. Will be ordering more!


Love this!


Beautiful dress just not proportioned for me


Beautiful dress and the quality is good at a reasonable price I like mostly by the pockets


Nice and long!


I can't express how I felt when I first saw the dress and tried it on, it's the most flattering dress I've ever worn! It fits perfectly and will make you feel like the most elegant lady! I'm thinking of buying another color of this dress!


I had to return this dress because it smelled horrible. I don't know if it was the fabric or what, but it stunk!


Super cute, fits my large breasts without smashing them. 5'9 and length was same as model shown.
