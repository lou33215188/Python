Nice dress, inexpensive. Received many compliments


I like the dress and get lots of compliments in it. My one minor complaint is that the torso is a bit short. It hits just a little above my waist, but still looks great. I may just get a wide belt.


Adorable dress. Very comfortable. Worth every penny


Although it's a bit larger than I wanted, the quality is better than I ever expected. I would definitely recommend this dress.


It's perfect! I love the material and the pockets! It's a little past knee length on me and I am 5'5. 150lbs and i ordered a large. I'm definitely going to buy some of the other patterns now!!


The dress is beautiful! One size up would have been better,  but I love it...a keeper!


Nice dress for work.


I'm 5'6", 140 pounds and ordered a medium. The dress is gorgeous and fit perfectly. I love the pockets, I was able to slip my phone in and it wasn't visible at all. I ordered the dress in Navy, and the top portion and skirt were slightly different shades, but I wore a tan belt and it wasn't noticeable at all.


It's very vibrant, great surprise


Be a beautiful dress with POCKETS! But the waist line is very high so I will be returning it.
