Love!!! Clothes are a struggle for me as a petite curvy girl, but this dress seems to fit people of lots of different sizes and shapes beautifully!


Beautiful dress! Well made, great material. Good price. I definitely recommend this.


I purchased a size up based on the reviews and I shouldn't have. I returned it and rephrased because it is such a cute dress.


Fit nicely. Great material! Everybody loved it.


Great dress for the price! A great dress in general, honestly. The material is thick and it's made well. Love having pockets as well, and they don't detract from the dress.


Fits wonderfully, pockets are great, I always get compliments when I wear it. You can tell the fabric is a little cheap and it probably isn't going to last, but I love it for now!


I love these dresses!! It’s hard to find a dress that isn’t too short (especially if you’re 5’9) and aren’t too sexy. These fit perfectly and o get compliments all the time! Pretty good material, lightweight, and comfortable. Highly suggest! I’ve bought them in 4 colors now. I bought a M, I’m a B/C cup and 150Lbs. The dress fits great.


The colar is to wideopen for my petite structure.


Good quality though!


My 17 yo daughter loved the style and fabric, but the the fit was baggy.


Perfect for the office, out on the town,easter, European trips and all. Only thing for me, I read reviews and figured id get a med. But I shoulda went for the small. I'm about 5 5 and 123 pounds. I wanted it to be fit. It's slightly loose which then makes all these possibilities available and still be sexy in a respectable way')
