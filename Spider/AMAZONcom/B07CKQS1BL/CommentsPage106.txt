Love this dress! It’s comfortable and so cute! I find it difficult finding a dress this style that doesn’t make me look like a balloon but this dress fits great.


I love this dress! I got the red polka dot. And I sized up to medium as per reading all the reviews. Definitely a must. Material is great and I'm gonna buy more colors!


Very cute, flattering & comfortable.


Love the dress and pockets. Fits perfect.


I absolutely loved this dress! I wore it for graduation and it was so convenient with the pockets! It fits well and looks pretty. It was a little long and i had to hem it a little but was totally worth it!


Very pretty dress!
