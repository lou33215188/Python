Love!! Only issue was the top. I'm 5'6" with 36c bust. Felt like I was smashed in the medium and arms were tight but the rest fit!


Beautiful and great fit


The dress is just like it is shown in the picture. I love it!


Great quality. Loves that is has pockets. Runs a little big though. I’m 5’6’’ 165pounds. I ordered a large and it’s a little looser than I would like.


A great dress.  I get tons of compliments and the pockets are a bonus!  The arms could be a little tight...if your upper arms carry some weight, but all in all, I can't complain!


Super fast shipping and I got so many compliments.  Not to mention pockets.  Love dresses with pockets.


This dress is beautiful. I'm so glad I bought it. It fits perfect


This was beautiful! I love this dress so much! I will be buying more from this seller.
