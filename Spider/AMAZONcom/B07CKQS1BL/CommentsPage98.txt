This dress was perfect for the event I bought it for. I got quite a few compliments on it.


The fit was a little loose and the zipper had a bunched up look which was odd. I returned it.


Wife loved it.  Only by luck fit her right.


What an awesome dress! Great feel & fit. Nice price.


Love it


The arms and chest were a bit snug while the skirt is really loose.


It's a simple dress.. nice for the office.


It is a perfect work dress that can be glammed up or made more relaxed for running around.


Such a fun dress! i love this and will probably buy more in other colors. super comfortable and not too heavy.


I love this dress. It was great for a wedding I had to go to. It will definitely be a dress I wear for special occasions from now on. Please make more dresses like this with this same type of silhouette and pockets.
