Not a bad looking dress but the waist hit a bit high on me and was not flattering. Returned. Beware long torso-ed ladies!


Love this dress! Comfortable material, great look, great fit. Can't wait to wear this dress to work. It's my second one (different pattern). Can't wait to get another one!


I got soo many compliments.  This is very flattering and very comfy. Love it so much, I ordered one in a different color/pattern.  hope it's as nice as this one.


Very flattering, good quality, can’t beat the price!  As a 34F I went with the medium but I might’ve been able to get away with a small, I just don’t like dresses that fit too clingy.


Returned because the blue in the top did not match or go with the blues in the skirt.  Otherwise, I would have loved it.


It is literally my new favorite dress my husband loveeees it too. Nice fabric and it doesn’t feel cheap at all. You can dress it up with a nice belt and heels or down with just flip flops.


I love this dress! It’s super flattering. Very pretty, true to size. I like it so much I ordered it in a second pattern


Other than a few uncut threads this dress looks great.  I got a lot of compliments when wearing it and it's a good length especially when you work with kiddos.  Very comfortable and nice quality.


I have to say I love this dress to life!  I travel for work and it was wrinkle free at my destination and just enough flowiness in the skirt to be comfortable all day long!  I plan on buying 1 -2 more - such great patterns


It is very stretchy. The waist sits high, right under the bust. It is not flattering for my figure. I have a bigger stomach and chest area, made me look pregnant.
