I LOVE this dress!!! I get compliments EVERY time I wear it. The fabric is great quality, it washes and dries well, and the pockets are the perfect added bonus! I'm 5'4 and wear a size 14 usually. I ordered a large. The dress fits like a glove; length and size! I will order more designs :)

Very nice dress, doesn't need ironing, no problems with washing in washing machine and drying in dryer. I am 5'4' and for me it looks shorter then on photo. But fit is really nice for curvy shaped women


First off, thanks to all the ladies that post pics and reviews.  This helps tremendously when ordering.  I ordered the dress with the mustard colored top and received a lot of compliments.  Paired with a red jacket and I was good to go.  Ordered a medium (Iâ€™m 5â€™7, 140) and it hit slightly below the knees and fit perfect.  Will order more.


Perfect fit for my 5'4" food-lovin' frame. The design is adorable, the style is flattering (and Baptist-modest without being frumpy, which is hard to find), and the material is like the dress version of the happiest sweatpants ever. Bought for Easter but I will definitely wear this to my admin job as well. I can add some dressy accessories and dress it up or wear it with flats and a cardigan and dress it down. Only complaint: the pockets aren't very deep and/or sit a little high and forward on my hips. But POCKETS!


I received so many compliments on this dress at work! It has a 50's vintage feel that is perfectly for twirling and who can say no to a dress with pockets?  I look forward to buying many more versions of this dress!


Coloring different from image. Arms are tight but body loose. And the torso isn't as long as it appears in photo. Hits as an empire waist rather than at natural waist. Still pretty though, just not the dress for me unfortunately. Returning today.


I tried this on in the office and received compliments. It's so cute! I love it, I plan on buying the other dresses in different Colors. It has a zipper but I easily slipped it on over my work clothes, without unzipping it. I may need a smaller size. The material is really nice as well and forgiving.


I really like the fit of the dress and the 3/4 sleeves. I don't like the pattern of the skirt very much. The floral pattern is large and makes the material look a bit cheap. The fit is spot on though.


I normally wear a medium dress and was worried this would be a cheap Chinese sized dress so I ordered a large and it actually is a little big! The fabric is nice and I didn't expect this dress to be so nice if we are being honest.
