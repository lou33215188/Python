I love the material, style exactly perfect, unfortunately to short for me


Advertised as 2X but actual size is a missy 14.  And I waited for over a month to receive it.  I won't buy clothes here anymore.


LOVE THIS dress. I get so many compliments. I am 5'8", pear shaped and a size 14 and the XL fits perfectly. Very flattering and has pockets in the skirt! I will be buying again in another color if possible.


Since several people commented to order a size up, I followed the suggestion for my daughter. However, for her body shape, the Medium size would have been just fine. If you have broader shoulders, then do size up.


This dress is made very well. The colors pop against the black. I normally am a 22 to 24 on top  and the 3x is a perfect fit. I was pleasantly surprised to discover pockets in the skirt portion of the dress. They are sewn in a way that they are not obvious. The skirt falls mid calf on me and I am 5 ft 2.


Great dress one small flaw in the chest area. Am returning item. Will update when I get a replacement.


Got a refund for flawed dress purchased another. This one is great. Wife loves it.


fit kind of odd, a little longer than i expected. very nice material and looks great though. went with L instead of the normal XL and it fit fine.


Great Material, not cheap feeling at all! Beautiful pattern and fits perfectly. May look into getting other designs because this was such a great dress purchase.


I normally wear a 16/18 in Walmart and Target sizes so I ordered the 2X and it fits perfectly. I loved it so much I ordered another one.


Very nice dress, too long for me. I am 5'1"and it reaches way below my knees, otherwise it fits perfect! love the patterns and the way it fits. I am short so I usually have to adjust my dresses, its not a problem for me. Love the dress
