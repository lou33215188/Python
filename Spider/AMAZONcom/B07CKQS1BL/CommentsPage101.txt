I love this dress. It is a bit on the small side. I typically wear a large, but bought an XL. The XL fits great. Will buy in different colors.


Quality ok for just running around errands, wonâ€™t wear to work or functions.


Material is amazing quality and fits perfectly.  I am 5'2" 140lbs and medium fit perfectly.  Super classy but casual enough for work.  I would highly recommend this dress!


great fit.  i would buy again.


This dress was a perfect fit, and its so classy! Such a great dress for weddings or formal dinners. Love it.


I liked the material, it's stretchie but just enough. The color was just how it looked in the picture. And the sizing is right.


It was a beautiful dress but unfortunately it did not fit well


Better than expected! I recevied several compliments. Nice quality dress.


The top of the dress is a little snug but other than that this dress is a good purchase.


Lovely dress. Fit perfect.
