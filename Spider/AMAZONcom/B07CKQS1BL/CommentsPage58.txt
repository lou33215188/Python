When I received this dress I was excited, great quality fabric. Super disappointed when I put it on. The arms were super tight. The bottom was way too big and voluminous and the back of the skirt flared out in a weird way and wouldn't lie flat. I do not have a long torso, but the dark top half seemed too short. Unfortunately had to go back.


I love this dress I want one in each color and style !  It's my go to dress for work


Terrible pattern. Looks super old fashioned. Returned immediately.


I'm 5'9 and the waist did not sit where it's supposed to. Shame.


Love this dress!! I am 5'5 and 240 I will try to find a picture to attached later but it is very true to size! I already wore it twice to church and another semi-formal event and got many compliments on this dress.


Pretty dress for work & casual lunch dates! Got many compliments with this dress. Fits as listed.


I am overweight at 5'5" and 199 lbs. This dress fit perfectly and is very comfortable. The shape and material are both very nice. I can get away with not using spanx if I like. The pockets are a great touch too!


Love this dress! I wore it to a conference and received lots of compliments. My one complaint is that it is a bit too short on me and not t-length as pictured. It hit me (5'9") just below my knees. I would have loved if the skirt were longer for a more vintage feel.


Fits as expected.nitbtoobloose or not too tight. Black part on top is tshirt material.overall good for the price


I needed this dress for an event, and it turned out to look absolutely perfect! I was going to get a bigger size, but my normal size fit just fine. I would recommend if you are larger chested to go a size up. It was a bit tight!
