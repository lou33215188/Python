Love this dress. I normally wear a xl or 14. Ordered a xxl it fit perfectly,


I love it! The fabric for the skirt is softer than I expected, but it will be perfect for the event I purchased it for, nice and loose and flowy. Pockets are high, but will be fine. I also thought the top looked thinner like t-shirt material, it's more firm, and not too stretchy. Hope this helps!


Saw that the dress ran small so I bumped it up a size and I love it!! So cute and modest, but not so much so that you feel like a pilgram lol ALSO IT HAS POCKETS!! This dress is a dream!


This is a great dress. I get compliments on it all the time at work. I like that the top is fitted, and it's very opaque. I can wear any bra with this. It won't show through. I wash it often, and the colors hold true. It has decent pockets also.


The dress was somewhat small, and also the colors were not exactly as depicted online


I saw a lot of posts about it running small so I ordered a size up and it's a but big on me. Turned out to be pretty true to size. Still very pretty. Very light and stretchy, but not see through. I love it, planning on wearing for a job interview!


Perfect fit for my pregnant bump! Very relaxing and beautiful material. I'm very satisfied with this dress. I definitely will be ordering another dress like this in different color. Thank you again for speedy delivery! ğŸ’�


The dress is prettier in real life than the pictures I love it. It's so soft and comfortable and it's perfect for my internships at an elementary school. Definitely will buy again, probably in multiple colors I'm obsessed. Also it has pockets which is making it a definite keeper


Dress is very pretty. It is high wasted. I like the material and can't wait to wear to church. It does have pockets on the side. You really can't tell they are there. I didn't notice till after I had washed it and hung it up.


I'm 5'2 and 110lbs. I Read the reviews and ordered a medium. It was roomy at the top and I loved the way it flowed. It was the perfect length and I got many compliments. I will be buying another one.
