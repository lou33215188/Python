This dress is adorable and highly flattering. The price is so, so good, I thought it must look cheap in real life, but nope not really! Could be styled so many ways and is versatile too. For reference, I am a little under 5'6 and wear a 14/16. I got the 2X and it was slightly loose but the length was perfect.


This dress surprised me. I normally shop for clothes from more recognizable brands but saw the pockets on this one (obsessed with pockets) and started reading through the reviews. Ordered two - can't beat the price. Wore the blue one to work for the first time today and thought for sure ppl would know how much I paid for it. But nope!  All I've been getting are compliments and requests for links to buy the dress!!  About to order some more. I ordered size S (usually a size 4 in dresses).


Love this dress! I'm 5'2" and it was a perfect length, right under the knee. Fit just as expected, and so cute! The material is nice, seems well made. I got so many compliments! Would definitely buy again!


Great dress and it looks just like the picture.  I usually wear between a US 10 and 12, am 5'3", 157lbs, very curvy, with thick biceps and this dress in the seller's size XL fits me perfectly.  Their XL says it's equivalent to a US 10 but it definitely has more room than that, given the relaxed, soft material.  I think it needs a slip as it can be transparent when sun shines through it but the polka dots help camouflage what's underneath.  I like the sleeve length for my arms because I work outside and have a major farmer tan mid-bicep.  This dress is totally flattering.  My husband loved it right away, had to come hug me from behind and admire from up close ;)  It's a keeper!


This dress makes me look pregnant.


I'm 5'10 and 3 quarters (so almost 5'11!), and I wear a size 16. I bought the XL. It fits fine, but the waist hits REALLY HIGH, right under your boobs, causing that "babydoll dress" look - which makes you look pregnant. I don't look pregnant in any other clothes, even at a size 16 because I'm rather tall so my weight is distributed well. I tried to belt this and everything, and no matter what, it just makes me look like I have a "baby belly" under the fabric. I am really disappointed. I don't know if the people in the pictures are just really short (so the waist of the dress hits them a lot lower) or they're wearing shapewear, but it doesn't look good on me at all. If you are tall, think twice.


I wanted this to fit so bad!!  It's beautiful and I love the feeling it had. I'm a 14/16 and I couldn't zip it. Ordered a 2x.  Please make them larger!!!


I'm 5'8" 150lbs.  My sister was getting married and wanted people to wear bright happy colors, so I chose the pink.  I was in between on whether to buy a L or an XL.  I initially bought an XL not wanting a tight fit, but I'm a 36A and the cut of the dress didn't work for my bust.  Anyone better endowed would have been fine :)  I then bought a L and it fit fine all around.  It's a little tighter than the XL, but the fit on top is much better.


One thing I like about this dress is that on me, the "skirt" starts at my belly button which means the part of me I'm most self-conscious of (my belly and thighs) are hidden under the skirt where they don't stand out.  The skirt hits just below my knees and I'd say the picture of the dress is accurate.  The fabric is heavier which for me was a nice change because you can't see my bra through it like you can sometimes with thinner material.


My husband thought I looked great in this dress.  Now I'm wedding ready.


Love this dress. It fit like a glove.


I wore this to church today and got so many compliments! The dress fits perfectly and I love the pockets! I'm ordering the other prints right now. ğŸ–¤


I really wanted to like this. I thought that it would be perfect for work in my classroom due to the length of the skirt and for the fact that it had sleeves. (We cannot wear sleeveless tops.) The pattern was pretty and matched the photo. I adored the pockets. However, the top portion of the dress just did not lay properly along the chest. I found myself pulling it, changing out to a different bra, but sadly, it just looked too baggy on top. (I purchased a small. I weigh 110 lbs, 5'4", 32 A). I returned it, but I would still recommend it to others to try. It had such potential!
