I own this in several colors. LOVE.


a tad bit transparent & strings were hanging; good buy overall


This dress is a great fit and very comfortable. I've received many compliments!


cute dress, loved the pockets but the pleats sat weird on my curvy shape


I haven't even worn this actual dress yet. I just bought 3 or 4 different colors of this same dress because I love the fit and love the pockets.


I love the dress.


Cute!


I love this dress, it is very good quality for the price. I got it in the navy color with tan flowers and it fits perfectly if you size up. I read the reviews to size up and i'm glad I did.


Really liked it.


Gorgeous.
