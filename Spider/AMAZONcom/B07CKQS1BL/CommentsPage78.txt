It’s pretty, but it’s too tight in the arms.


Cute dress! Love the pockets and lightweight material. I did order another size up and I'm glad I did. A little big around shoulder area but waist fits perfect.


Dress is beautiful and has a classic and timeless feel to it. Fit well. I bought it in Large and I'm 5'1 and 157 lbs and it fit perfectly. Can't wait to wear it out.


Superrr cute and flowy! Zipper is a bit difficult to get on your own but the dress is beautiful! There’s also pockets in it ,it’s amazing!


I wasn't sure on the size I could have wore a size smaller but it will work, it is definitely worth the price!


Cute but not good if you are chesty. Couldn't get it zipped up


Beautiful Dress. Size is perfect I am a size 12 I ordered a size large. It is actually stretchy in areas so you don't feel like  you are going to bust out. Pockets what can I say very cool and cute. I recommend this. Makes you feel classically beautiful.


XL fits great! Stretchy fabric allowed for give over my bust, and the cut is just right. Very flattering for someone tried to slim their arms and hide their tummy.


Fit was really nice, it was a little loose in the chest/back area but I knew this from other reviews but probably for the best when worn to work! It is a few Inches below my knee (I'm 5'4) Lots of compliments I definitely want to order a few more!


LOVE this dress! I got a size up based on reviews, and its a little more lose than I would have normally purchased, but I love the fit and got so many compliments!
