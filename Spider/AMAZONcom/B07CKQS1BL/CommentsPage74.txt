Love and get lots of compliments, looks more expensive then it is


Fun dress and got several compliments on it. I am going to try some other patterns/colors. Look at the sizing information, however, as it is a bit different than typical US sizing (but if you follow what they provide, you will get a great fit).


Beautiful! Ordered 2 sizes up and fit perfect! I am going to order another dress in diff. color now.


Runs somewhat small. The waist fall a bit to high if you are tall but other than that it's a cute dress with nice material


Very comfortable and true to size!  I love it!


I absolutely adore this dress. I bought the red one. I wasn't expecting the quality to be so good! I will definitely be buying the other colors as well!


I love this dress! I received a lot of compliments and people couldn't believe the price. Beautiful color and comfortable to wear. I bought 2 more!
