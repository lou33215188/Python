The dress looks just like the picture but was a little disproportionate. the chest area was too close to the shoulders. It was also too tight for me.


It came super fast. The material was nice but the bust was HUGE. Unfortunately it didn't fit!


Love it


This dress is gorgeous! I have fallen in live with it and can't wait to wear it in two weeks! The delivery was speedy and timely. I will order from you again!


Beautiful dress.... Much more than I expected... Looks fabulous! Thank you!


color is nt the same as picture


For the price I like the dress. First order dress was a little too big. Second order dress fit more exact. Only exception the sequence started falling off. So Im going for a third. Hope this one comes in better condition. Otherwise good for the price.


Nice design & style of dress but it was too big in the bust. Check the size chart to ensure right size.


Love it


Is a beautiful dress and excellent quality. Is long for me because I'm short, but is perfect.
