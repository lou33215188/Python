I went by my bust size and the dress fit beautifully! The material was great and I got so many compliments. The zipper did stick a little on the side, that could have been user error.  I love this dress and wish I had more places to wear it. The color was a little darker than in the photo, but not too much.


Great bridesmaid dress


gave it 3 stars only because it would have looked really pretty if it had fit. Followed size chart and couldn't even zip it 1/4 the way up.


color was not light blue but light green


Runs a bit small if you are woman and not a junior wearing for prom. It is a lovely dress and is a good length. I got a size 8 , I wear a 4 to a 6 in jeans and shorts. I am 34 D in the chest. the chest fit fine but too much cleavage for me .


I know I should have expected what I received for the price, but I was still honestly disappointed. The design on the back is so cheap looking and the bust area was so gigantic I could fit both my fists in it while wearing it...I do not recommend buying this dress.


I bought it to wear as one of my birthday  dresses it fit beautiful I just turned  61 got so many compliments in this dress will recommend just get a size bigger I wear an 8 had to return it for a 10.


The dress is beautiful and the color is just as brilliant as it shows online.. I ordered a size 14 and it is very big for me and too long I need to get it adjusted..I am 5' 4" 170 lbs cup size c-d


This dress is beautiful and fits so nicely. Much nicer then expected because it was so affordable. Was perfect for masquerade party


I wore this dress at my son's wedding.  However, I did take it to a seamstress to adjust the bodice as I didn't like the cleavage it showed.  Once she fixed that, it was absolutely stunning.
