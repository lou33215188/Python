Gorgeous dress!  I did have to have it hemmed and the chest taken in.  I am only 5'2" and not well endowed so it wasn't unexpected.  I probably could have returned it for a smaller size but time didn't permit that.


Beautiful dress. Upsize because it runs 1-2 sizes smaller.


I didn't realize how much sequin was on this, and it was way large in the bust for me while being tight in the waist. I'm a c, 5'5" and 155 pounds. It made me sad because I LOVED the color.


Live the dress but sadly have to buy another getting married next week gave no time for alterationsğŸ˜�


I am 5 feet even and 120 lbs, so I purchased the size 6 knowing I would have to get the length taken up. I had read some reviews saying that the dress was tight in the bust area. I am petite and barely a B cup, so this was not at all the case for me. I actually had to have the bust area cinched in. Both alterations cost me $40, which seems reasonable considering the dress is only $40 to begin with. The dress turned out to be lovely and fit like a glove. It was extremely tasteful for our office's Masquerade Ball Christmas Party. My one negative critique is that the bolero-style back and shoulder area does not really allow for comfortable dancing. I couldn't raise my arms up past my eye-line without the material cutting into me.


I didn't remember take a full length picture, but have included a 3/4 picture and an one extra that shows off the sequenced, bolero-style shoulder area.


Used the size chart and the top shoulder part didn't lay right


Somewhat small, but great dress!


The dress is perfect! I received it expecting to make alterations and I didn't have to. I'm 5' 1.5" so I definitely need heels for this dress. In addition, I have 27" waist so the dress (sz 4) fit perfectly there. I will definitely order from Ever Pretty again for future occasions.


I just wanted to save a little money. I just wanted something simple and avoid that whole wedding-dress-shopping-drama. OMG. I'm so jealous of all these women who seem to find so much success finding their dress online. Not me. Either too small, too big, uneven fit (too small up top, too big down bottom).


This dress is my last attempt. It is HORRIBLE. Seams sticking out everywhere and zipper WONT EVEN OPEN. Initially when I opened the box, I was so impressed. On a hangar (unlike the others), all covered up in plastic, looking so nice and well cared for like those you see at those "real" bridal salon, and for under 50!


Then, I lifted up the plastic, and all I saw were tacky circles and white string/seam pieces sticking out everywhere...I thought, okay, it's here, I should at least try it on, maybe I can cut off the strings, and no one would be the wiser. Oh, and lose the tacky circles of course (that "design"? NOT EMBROIDERY. Instead, a bunch of tacky arts-and-crafts-like glossy mini circles/donut shape looking things one after the other, after the other, just VERY LOOSELY stitched in...) But no, I didn't even get the chance b/c the zippers would NOT open.


THIS IS BEAUTIFUL...IT CAME WITH A LITTLE BLACK MARK ON THE BACK BUT I DIDN'T MIND IT MUCH...BREASTS ARE 38d AND THIS IS PERFECT FOR GIRLS WITH BOOBS....GOT IT FOR  A LITTLE WEDDING AND 100% RECCOMEND THIS..
