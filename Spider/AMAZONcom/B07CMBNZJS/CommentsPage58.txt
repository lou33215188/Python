Fit my mother like a glove so perfect no alterations needed!!


Nice dress arrived on time, slightly too big


Beautiful and elegant for the price


It was snug and the zip was problematic.


The dress is beautiful!  I ordered a size 10 because I heard the dress runs small.  I am 35 b on top it's a bit large I'll have it taken in. Keeping it!


The zipper was poorly put in and would not zip up or down without catching on fabric. I had to return it


Very nice dress


Not too bad !


Absolutely love this dress. Fit perfectly!


Too small
