I'm 5.9 and the dress was short in front because of the style; I didn't care too much for that. It fit perfectly width wise, but i wanted a floor length dress.


The dress is fabulous I'm 220 lbs bust size 38B and I bought size 16 fits perfectly  I don't regret buying it


Wonderful fit very beautiful material all around 400% nice


My mom used it for my wedding she has red hair so it was perfect this dress in green. the texture of the material is light but at the same time has weight so its wonderful


Top of the dress is not suitable for large chested women.


Very light and comfortable dress and I didn't need to wear spanks! it was just slightly big in the bust, but over all very nice.


Perfect and Beautiful ğŸ˜Š


good


Beautiful dress, but too small for my size. Gave it to a friend as a gift she loves it


I double-checked my order when I got it in the mail.  The bag had the same order number as what I had ordered, but they sent me the Ever Pretty Empire Waist Pleated Rhinestone V Neck Bridesmaid Dress 09449 in white.  I kept it because I didn't have time to return it before my concert.  It was the correct size and did fit well, though.
