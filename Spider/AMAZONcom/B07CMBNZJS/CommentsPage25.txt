Ordered this dress in a size 14 it fit a little loose around the waist but the reason I am stating somewhat large is because around the breast area it was big. It is such a dissapointment when a dress fits you somewhat perfect everywhere except the chest. I love the tail but I feel the front is a little short.


This was way too small in the bust - it was fine everywhere else.


Beautiful dress. Fit as expected


This dress is beautiful. Im 5' 2", 125 lbs, and the Medium fit me perfectly. It is low cut at the bust but with a bra on (preferably with spagetti straps further apart towards the arms), it looks great!


My 20yr old son bought me this dress in purple as a mothers day gift to wear on a cruise we will be going on this month. I think its to pretty for a cruise, but he insists I use it at the Captains Dinner. ?...I DO love it, so how can I refuse!


This looks like a $200 dress. For a quarter of that price, I definitely recommend buying it!


Fast delivery and seems put together well. Love it all the way around.


Fit as expected.  If you will purchase, make sure to take a look at the chart. If you do, it will be just perfect.  I ordered two sizes just in case, however, end up keeping the one that was my size.  It looks favoulos!


Beautiful dress! Runs small! Order at least 2-3 sizes bigger.


I loved this dress but I had a hard time with the zipper.


This dress is gorgeous but the zipper blew out and I am going to have to take it to a seamstress before I can wear it.  Luckily I was home when the zipper broke.


Good quality
