It was too big


I didn't try on this dress because I found another I liked before this was shipped, so I can not offer a review


I am a size 8 in every dress I have. this is a huge dissapointment and has disencouraged me to ever purchase clothing from Amazon again.


My daughter and my wife both got together and decided to buy six of these dresses for the bridesmaids of her wedding held last July 2016. They got all the details with sizes to match each of the bridesmaids and they all fitted perfectly, no adjustments were needed and they were all satisfied.


I made a few tucks for my daughter.....she is very self conscious about cleavage showing. She wore it to her junior prom. She is 5'2", so I did hem it a little so she wouldn't trip.


Love this dress and was shipped quickly. Thank You!  Still looking for a dress due to this one being the same color as the bridesmaids dresses.  Will Probably order for Ever Pretty again soon.


This dress is beautiful on. It fits to size and looks great for the price. Also it arrived shortly after I ordered it which was great. Didn't like how it was folded in package to fit the mailbox. Otherwise, I would highly recommend.


Such a beautiful dress. Perfect for prom


It is a beautiful dress but it is a bit big and several inches to long. It was also missing sequence in several areas.


Colores are different .
