love love love that dress i was the prefect bride.great for a beach wedding.thank you so very much


The hem and the bust were easily fixed to be able to fit me.


Not a good fit


this dress is smaller in size than the normal sizes I can wear in most clothes. I measured myself and went according to the chart but it still did not fit.


It worked well for another bridesmaid we traded size


The reviews said it ran small so I got the next size up and it was too big. If I would have gotten the size I am it would have been a good fit I think. The dress is beautiful, just too big.


This should be my 5th dress from this company and I am really impressed by the colour , fitting and texture this  dress is  really beautiful.Their customer care is simply remarkable.i hope to get more dresses from this company.


I ordered up 2 sizes. Difficult to zip up all the way.


I went base off a lot of the reviews regarding size and it was way too big, I was also disappointed because the way they sewed the shoulder straps was very short and there was no room between my chest and neck, the V cut was basically up to my collar bone and the back did not sit flat.


This dress looks pretty from the front, but the sequence in the back is so cheesy.  I can't wear it as is. I'm going to take it to a tailor and see if I can have the back replaced somehow.
