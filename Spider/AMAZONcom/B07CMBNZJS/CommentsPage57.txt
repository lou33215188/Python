This dress is drop dead gorgeous, my mother loved it and she looked beautiful in it!!


Me and some other ladies ordered this dress for my pastor's banquet and it fitted perfectly. The only issue is there is not enough material to cover the breasts. Other than that it fits fine.


Didn't like all the sequins. The dress looks cheap with the sequins. I returned it as it is not something I would wear.


The dress was beautiful & arrived  on date given.  I just didn't get right size & had to return in.  No problems at all with return process.


I love this dress, the color was perfect and the quality was good. I'm a D cup and the top still ran a little bit bigger than you might expect.overall I am very happy with my purchase...Can't beat the price

The color was perfect, but the bust area was too small
