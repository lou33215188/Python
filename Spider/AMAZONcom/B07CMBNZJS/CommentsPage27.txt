This is a beautiful dress. I ordered in champagne and it was true to color. It fit as expected, but may need some altering to be perfect. The train is beautiful and it is very flowy and elegant for the price.

Beautiful fit, color and length. Love this dress.


Everything fits except the bust part which was too big.  Other than that, beautiful dress.


It is a fine dress but the one I ordered did not fit me and I'm not sure that it would look good on me even if it did fit, but I'm sure it would work for someone else. I'm going to have to return mine.


Beautiful dress, the shoulders were just a tad too much for me. I sent back and Ever Pretty refunded right away! Awesome customer service
