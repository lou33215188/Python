Great fit!


Dress looks nice but too large, i returned


hi ever prity iam haapy resevied it same talking you sayed wish good Luke for you you are 5 stars wish interdouce  more for us


What a great dress -- I am 5"4", and it was a little long in front.  Loved the small train in back.  Great fabric. I expected something really cheap for this price, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Bodice was also sized for a DD, but my C's still are covered.  When I had it hemmed, I also had the bodice taken in a little.  Would definitely recommend it -- I feel so elegant wearing it!  I'm using it for a ComiCon costume and I added a crinoline under it -- looks great with or without the crinoline.


The dress fit perfectly and the length was good as well. It just came to us in the wrong color.


When I got my dress I was very disappointed as I had bought it for my graduation. The material is too flimsy and is transparent. I was expecting a very elegant dress, but it is not.


This is a pretty dress expect being unable to fill out the top properly.  I also found this sequins on the back upper area to cheapen the look of the dress


Smaller than the size says


I ordered the gown for my daughter for a formal event she was attending.  She LOVED it, the fit was just right no alterations were needed.  The material was very light and flowed very well. The style was simple but classy. She looked BEAUTIFUL!  I would recommend this item.


Thank You
