The zipper is on the left side and is hard to zip by myself.  Beautiful dress and wonderful rich color.


The products were good except the ring and the dark purple dress.


This dress was of poor quality in workmanship and fabric. The bra inserts were large and stiff and made the top look odd. The waist material was cheap and the pleats were a mess. Sent it back


Dress is for my daughter which lives in a different state. She received it in perfect condition. Fit perfectly. Thank you so much will order from you again.


I bought this dress on line and wore it to the Academy Awards. I received a lot of compliments on the dress and I was sure smiling inside knowing I had only spent $35.00 on it. I felt like a princess in it and it was the perfect dress for a perfect night.


Beautiful just like the picture and fits perfect


Lovely dress, fit is perfect for a taller person.


Beautiful dress for the price


Top portion too large and didn't fit on shoulders correctly--needed to be pulled tighter. Size was too large--need to go one size smaller since not form fitting. Very pretty in picture and on the model. Sorry
