Sequence coming off


I absolutely LOVE this dress. I didn't expect the elegance this dress gives for such a low price! It meets and exceeds all expectations. At first, I thought it was going to be WAY TOO big. Not the case. I have received SO many compliments. The color is more of a blushing peach. Absolutely gorgeous in person. EXTREMELY FEMININE! I will definitely order from this seller again. Thank you so much!


Little plain


Loved it fit like it was made for me. Zipper was Broken on arrival had no time to send it back, I just replaced it.


I ordered three of these dresses to be worn at a special event my daughter and two other friends are attending. The color and quality is wonderful. My daughter was so excited when she saw the dress. I hope to post a picture.


Nice dress


I bought this for my wife and she love it is awesome and the size was perfect.,and the size at chart was exactly.


Pretty dress, but the sizing is all wonky. I tried the size chart and got a dress too small, then tried my normal size and got a dress too big. I recommend purchasing a size that closely matches your normal size for the shoulder/bust/rib area, because the rest of the dress is not form-fitted. The zipper is along the side of the bust, if you get it too small you won't be able to zip it (no stretch). It's also somewhat long (I'm 5'7) so for dancing you'd want to hem it.


I like it but to long


beautiful!!!
