Very good ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ’‹ğŸ˜˜


This dress was a mess! The dress was blue and purple. It looked like they just threw scrap pieces of material together to form the dress.. Strings everywhere! This is a sub par product and it is going back soon! It really sucks because I don't have time to shop for the event I needed this dress for. I give it one star because it did arrive quickly, although I wish I never laid eyes on it.. Just sad! Amazon should uphold their vendors to a better, higher quality than this. So disappointed....


I LOVE  THAT DRESS AND SO EVERYYONE


I bought this dress for a formal and this dress is Just BEAUTIFUL! it is elegant, lightweight, And travels well. The dress is a little long, but with some heels its manageable.But if your looking for an Elegant, Beautiful, and Reasonable dress, This is a dress to consider. Trust me!


Love it great fit


nice


A little long but i like it


It is bigger at the top and reveals too much of breasts


Wore this to a black tie event. I was in the room with very high end dresses and received many compliments. Thanks for getting it to me so quickly .


I got t lots of compliments on the and I also liked the way the dress looked after I had to get help to close they zipper. The only bad about the dress is that the bust area is tight and hard to zip.
