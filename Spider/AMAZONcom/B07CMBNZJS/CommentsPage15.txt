Looks better in the pictures. Didn't suit me and looked kind of cheap...sent it back :(


The dress is grand but fits somewhat large especially the upper torso. Pink is a very good color and the quality of fabric was also nice.


Love, Hugs, & Butterfly Kisses! ♥ ♥  love this so much> I


Used this dress for my brother's wedding. It looked so nice and well made. Very happy with this purchase. I had to fix the top part because it was a little baggy but besides that was perfect.


This is one of the best purchases i have ever made. The dress is gorgeous. Material of quality for its price. However the measurements are as exactly on the chart. Cant wait to wear it...


Took the word of the seller to use the sizing chart provided.  I purchased the size as indicated on the chart.  It fit perfectly.  It is a very pretty dress.


Super pretty and flattering dress. It flows to cover imperfections and the waist band makes my not so flat stomach look great!


The dress I got does not look like the dress in the picture. It's much longer than it said it was and is too tight around my rib cage. I was really in love with the dress in the picture. I am extremely disappointed.


I bought this for my mother and she loved it.  the bust area was a little roomy, hence the 4 stars.


A little large around the boobs and shoulder, but I'm between a size 8 and 10. Bought the 10, fixed it by doing some minor alter around the chest area and fits nicely now
