Loved the color of this dress, looked exactly like it did online. Definitely shows more cleavage than the model wearing it, and had longer train in back that I was not expecting. However, for the cost it is absolutely a bargain.


I really like this dress it looks better up close.


Too big


I was very pleased that this dress was somewhat large on me.  I had the V-neck tacked because I felt as though a little too much was showing.  This dress is very elegant and flattering. Exceptionally priced for the quality and look.


Very good I like the dress


Very dissapointed the bottom is see through


Decent quality for the price.  I just wasn't expecting the train.


Good quality .


Beautiful color and soft fabric but too thin and flimsy


Too tight around my chest


The sequins were a little bit cheap looking
