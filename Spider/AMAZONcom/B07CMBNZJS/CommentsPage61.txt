Highly dissatisfied


Love the dress. Fits well, Ordered it in black, perfect.


The dress is more then perfect for our event. Love how it's so light and cool for the summer. I will order from them again.


it was beautiful but the measurements didnt fit me-


great fit but the top is to loose needs to thighten a bit


The colour is gorgeous


wooow it beautiful and not large i love it very mutch,,, thank you amazone ,, i'm from libya and this the firist thing i bought it from internet


I LIKED THE DRESS BUT RETURNED BECAUSE IT WAS TO SNUG. THE MEASUREMENTS LIST FOR THE ITEM SEEMED A BIT BIGGER THAN THE ACTUAL DRESS.


Beautiful gown, fit perfectly. It's a little booby for the performance I bought it for (a religious mass) I decided to send it back. But if I was using it for any other performance, recital or something I would have kept it. Very form flattering! I highly recommend it.


Too small despite going by their size chart. I got it on but couldn't zipper it up. I'm going to attempt a larger size and will update my review, but honestly it seems like it's just cut weird. That satin waist band was over my breasts ( and mine are about where they should be as of writing this lol. Just above the halfway point between your shoulder and elbows) whoever made this dress thinks breasts grow out of the clavicle.


The sequin design on the shoulders and back was cheap looking. I thought those were rhinestones in the pic. If I can get a proper fit I'm going to remove them or cover them. It reminds me of a kid's dance recital costume.
