Measurement are too big on top too small in the bottom didn't work for me


Beautiful dress, but there is no give at all. Size up


When I received the dress the zipper would not unzip. Sellers comment was to choose a different style dress. The formal dress was crammed in a small envelope and looked horrible when i got it out.


This dress fits great.  I am glad I made the decision to purchase it.  Adding it to my wardrobe with no regrets


doesn't come like the picture


Had to alter the shoulders and bust to fit. Did not like the train-tail, altered and made it an even hemline.


The dress had the problems as stated, so if you have a small ribcage and shoulders of a football player and breasts equivalent of a 36EEE THIS dress might fit you. I usually wear a size 12. My bra size is a 36D.


is not how it looks in the picture its a real cheap material if you want it as a costume gor for it but from prom or a party dot worth it


They shipped the wrong dress.


Bought this dress for my daughter for Winter Ball.  It fit so well and she looked gorgeous!  She had so many positive comments about how stunning she looked.
