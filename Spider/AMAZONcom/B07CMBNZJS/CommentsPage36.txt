I just wanted to thank you for the fabulous dress.It fit like a glove. Usually i would not by something of this stature,just takiing a chance and truly love it!


Wore this dress to a wedding. The fit was comfortable and the quality of the material and workmanship was outstanding.


This dress is really beautiful, the quality is great forbthe price.


Nice and flowy!  Perfect fit!


Got this for my wife and she loved it. The product had a good price and material is also of a good quality


Too long and collar was stiff,  but color and bodice of dress was beautiful.


Beautiful. Quality. European sizing use their chart.


Overall it's beautiful our daughter is just bigger in the torso the we expected for the dress


This dress is a bit awkward and large in the top.  It's also a little thin in the skirt.  Beautiful color red but a bit disappointed in fit and length.


Material felt cheap. Easily wrinkled. Not st to remove the padding. Size chart seems inaccurate
