Very pretty but the front length needed to be longer by an inch, at least. None the less its a nice dress.


The dress looks pretty much like the picture, but the bust has a really strange line to it. The sequins look fairly tacky in person. Great customer experience as far as returning the item goes, and I would recommend the vendor, but not this product.


Great fit


I bought a size larger, because normally the formal dresses run smaller. But I should have bought my regular size, as I had to take this one in. So be sure to buy your regular size when purchasing this dress.


Other than that this dress is GORGEOUS! I got many compliments on it!


Great


Absolutely perfect!


A little to big around the breast area


Beautiful!

Beautiful dress however the chest is awkward, very large gap near the under arm and very low cut.  Fits bigger then expected.
