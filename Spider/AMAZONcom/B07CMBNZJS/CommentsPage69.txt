I picked this dress for my sister to wear at my wedding she is my maid of honor and I was so happy when it came in the one day shipping and it fit her to a T and with nothing wrong with the dress I love it on her


I was wanting this for my 13 year old daughter but it was not what I thought it was, it fits big, the color is not a fresh light pink, it has more brown in it... it is ok but defiantly for an older lady its maternally


Wayy to small


Very pretty dress and well made. Well worth the price I paid for it. A stunning shade of green. Nice fit, but it does run a bit small. I usually wear a size 16, and it fits like a glove. Cannot afford to gain a pound or it won't fit. All in all, very happy with my purchase.


I gave it 2 stars because it is a gorgeous dress but the size was wrong. It is to small and I can't wear it.


Shoulder straps could be a little tighter for a better fit, which should cover more of the breast area. Especially if you are a D cup


I alway wear size L but when I bought this dress with size L, I didn't imaged its too big, it's look like size XXL not size L


kind of off white , color and size not corrected, not for my body.  too long but I knew because of my height.


The dress was too big but I am pregnant so I am in between sizes. The dress is very pretty but it is thin so you will need a slip.


This dress is amazing.  Good quality, the color is also beautiful.  The price is good for this dress. Try ittt
