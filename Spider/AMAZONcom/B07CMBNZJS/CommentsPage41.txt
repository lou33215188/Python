I wore this for the captain's dinner on a cruise this summer. It fit as expected. It is made of good quality material. I got it in sapphire blue and the color was just as expected. Loved it! Would buy from this seller again in the future!


I ordered this dress as a mother of the bride for my daughters wedding in July. It fits great but it does reveal alot of cleavage, not inappropriate but something I am not too used to. The price was fantastic and the gown is comprible to dresses at bridal stores. I am a younger mom so I plan on wearing. I will but from ever pretty again


Beautiful dress. Absolutely gorgeous on. Reviews said it ran smaller when in fact it ran a little big. Overall, completely worth the price!


Dress is beautiful but if you are big chested best to get the next size or 2 up from your normal dress size.


Beautiful dress for evening wear and weddings.


Nice dress and looks more expensive than it is . I received a lot of compliments.This dress is true to size so follow the manufacturer's sizing chart even if it is smaller than you normally wear.


Loved it. Great fit and beautiful flow.


It was nice but for what I needed it for


The dress fits as I expected it to fit. I love the dress except that the neckline is a little lower than what I expected from the picture. I am not comfortable showing cleavage. Other than that it is beautiful.


Had to return it. Was to small. And since im short, it was really long. Had a long train. Which i didnt expect. But it is a pretty dress.
