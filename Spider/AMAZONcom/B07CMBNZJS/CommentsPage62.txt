Live the dress


I chose 3 because when I first opened a package I did not like it at all. Color is fabulous, exactly as pictured. It smells weird. The quality is okay, especially for this price I could not find any better.  I was planning to wear this dress with high heels, I am 5"4 feet but I can wear it only with 2 inch heels. So, it was a little shorter than expected.Bust part is a little wide, but it looks better on person when you wear it. I had some issues with zipper, I can not zip it by myself. Other than that I really like the color, but  the quality could be better!


Perfect fit


Loved this dress! Fit as advertised! Only problem was the long train in the back. Will buy from Ever Pretty again!


Nice fit an length.


Size runs very small


Love â�¤ this dress ğŸ‘— came out perfect for me!!!


Size 8 which I ordered fits like a size 6. The bust was tight and small. Also was not aware if the train.


Great


The product was very good only the size was an issue
