The zipper was damaged upon arrival


i like it


Although the dress I ordered was one size too small (with no fault of the sellers size chart), it was truly a beautiful gown. It fit my mother to a tee, but too fancy for her to wear as a guest to my cousins wedding, so I wasn't able to keep it. The gown still deserves 5 stars because the back of the dress is sexy but conservative. It gives the wearer to have a little bit extra without showing too much extra. The materials used are comfortable and glows so gently. The small train makes it such a wonderful gown for a bridesmaid or maid of honor. Just gorgeous. I totally recommend this to everyone and anyone who is looking to not only feel absolutely perfect, but to look that way to others as well for a very special occassion.


It is as beautiful as it is pictured and fit perfectly


this is a lovely dress, the neckline plunged a little lower and was more revealing than I wanted.
