I love.this dress bought it for seminar and I ordered  a size up just in case cuz Im big in the chest area.


Looks just like the photo. Beautiful


Top is big . Nice dress for an evening. Because the top is to large and fits sort of irregular it makes the neck to low. Nice dress though.


pretty dress but shows way too much cleavage for a wedding bridesmaid dress


Okay...priced well.


I thought my dress would arrive new but when I got it there were pit stains on it. The dress is long but I expected that from reviews I read.


Color and fit was perfect!!!  Love the feel and look of the dress as well.


Grace Kelly would wear this!


Beautiful color and material............it's a little small though


too  long my mom fix it
