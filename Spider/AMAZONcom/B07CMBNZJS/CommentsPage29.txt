This dress did not fit me, however it was beautiful!  The color was radiant.  I am a little top heavy so, It just did not fit me respectfully and was tight.  I would recommend.  The empire cut is very nice as well.


Loved this dress, id recommend going one size up, as im a 12, the dress fit perfect but it was tight around my arms and this caused the zipper to dig in a bit.


looks just as pictured. is well made. fits true to size.


very pretty design, but the fabric feels cheap. The cut was a bit funny , with really large bust and armholes. I sent it back.


I love this dress!! It's super soft and fits in all the right places. It is a little difficult to get off the top part doesn't undo anywhere so you have to  wiggle out of it but if that doesn't bug you go for it sister!! I got this for a ball and I can't wait to show it off!!

This dress was beyond my expectations! It was beautiful and comfortable. I got so many compliments and everyone asked where I got it! Made for a fun and elegant evening!


A little bit see trough but otherwise the dress is wonderful.


very pretty- but doesn't puff out like in pictures


A little tight on the bust. The zipper is right under the left arm, and it's a bit rough (keeps getting caught on fabric), but after some carefully put machine oil, it works like a charm! Gorgeous, black, chiffon, beautiful dress. Worth every cent.
