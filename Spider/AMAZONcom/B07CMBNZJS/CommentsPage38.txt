around the shoulder


This dress turned out to be a great purchase.  It fit nicely and for the price it is awesome.  In excited to wear it out.


The color is rich and the dress is beautiful.  It is just very small in the bust area.  If you are above a b cup, this probably will not work for you.


Very inexpensive dress, but looked like it. I returned the dress because I didn't like the trim on the shoulders.


Beautiful dress, good material but runs small. I usually wear 14-16!in dresses and this dress was a size 16 yet it didn't fit I wish they carried a larger size


the dress is low quality. seams were all wrong and puckered. I would not recommend.


This dress fit fine in other areas but was obiviously built for a large chested woman!


Showed up right on time. Pretty and good price.


Beautiful dress! Fit perfectly


Beautiful Dress
