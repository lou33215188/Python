I LOVE it!!  My Tooth Fairy costume is complete now! Ordered the size actually wear but it was far too small. Returned it with no problems and re-orded a size larger. Came really fast and fits great! My Tooth Fairy costume is complete now!


I bought this dress as part of a wedding dress costume for Comic Con. I added some beading to the top, but the dress was already very pretty. It's quite flattering; my only complaint is that it's more low-cut than I expected. I had to make some alterations so that my bra wouldn't be hanging out. It's a nice dress and I got a lot of compliments.


ordered for my mom to wear to my brother's wedding this fall. she wasn't happy with anything we saw at the bridal shops around town, so thankful Amazon came through! gorgeous dress, fine material, exactly as pictured.


My daughter wanted this dress for a vacation to Puerto Rico and we ordered it one size bigger which fit her perfect. This is a very nice dress for the money and my daughter was very happy which gives it a 2 thumbs up. Thanks Amazon.


Normally an 8 went by measurements, and ordered a 10.


It's like it was meant for me. Love it and can't wait to wear.


BEAUTIFUL. Fit sister in law perfectly! Even has a train!


Supposed to be woman size but came with Jr tags,to small and very wrinkled(as stated by other reviews) color not lt blue but rather bluefish green.


I wanted to like it, but the bottom is completely see-through so expect to wear a slip.  (ordered in white)  Also, I have a bust of 42, ordered a 14 per their size chart and it's still too large.


It is a nice dress but i have to return it since it does not fit me. It runs small.


While the dress is very pretty it is way smaller then the sizes they indicate. I ordered a size up and it still was way to small. Also wear the built in bra is the bra sit smack dab in the middle of the chest. Not true to size and not even made right!
