Little long for the skirt, but everywhere else fit perfectly!


100% recommended good quality


Super gorgeous and well made, wore it for a social and got many compliments.


Pretty dress- I'm busty though and it made my bust look even bigger. Only giving this one star because I had to pay $5 to send the dress back...so basically had to pay for a dress just to try it on. Will not buy from Ever Pretty again knowing if something doesn't fit I have to pay to return it. Boo.


Very nice dress for the money. Fits exactly as expected.


Very pretty dress.  Good material and well made


Dress was beautiful and good quality.Sadly it was too small for my daughter, super tight around ribs and really long, but it was really easy to return


Large in bodice area ... sequins need to be updated ...


Sorry, it did not fit me well.


Way too small.
