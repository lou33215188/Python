I purchased this dress because it looked beautiful and elegant on the picture. I read many reviews about it before deciding. When I received it, I immediately fell in love with it. Style, size, color, material, everything was as expected. It's a big longer than I need but I'll pretend I'm one of those actresses walking the red carpet :), That's how gorgeous I felt when I tried it on. 100% recommended.


the top was very large


Fitting was tight around the bust. The top of the dress also fits weird


Wore this on my wedding day & it fit just perfectly!


The dress fit great, I needed no alterations! I loved the material the dress was made of as well! Great product!


Beautiful but fits small.


Very pretty dress. Great price


I can't wait to wear this to my company function in November..


My sister is one of my bridesmaids.. And it looks good one her. But a little small. But love it


love this dress beautiful
