It looks bug but it fits just right. Just a little long, nothing that can't be fixed.


I got the size 12. Fits good everywhere. Didn't need a bra, but it was way too long. Had to have it hemmed and spent more for that then the dress. If I had more time I would have sent back and looked for a petite dress. But I made it work.


beautiful!!!!!! got so many compliments, love everything by this company


This dress was a little disappointing.  It didn't look as I expected.  Sorry.


But the color was beautiful.


I bought these as bridesmaid dresses.  They are exactly as pictured/described.  Very elegant and beautiful.  Very well-made.  Love them and received compliments from everyone who saw them.  They looked great on all bridesmaids, every body type.


I Like it a lot have not worn it yet it is for my son's wedding looks real nice on.


Beautiful dress, elegant and wonderful price.  I will have to have it hemmed but other then that I love it.


Absolutely stunning and great price! I got so many compliments wearing this. I love it. I do want to get one in every color :D


This is a pretty dress but I did not like the fit and therefore I returned the dress.


Thank you very much receipt of the product, which was in excellent condition and in conformity with the specifications mentioned in the presentation


I hope all the shops dealing directly with Saudi Arabia .
