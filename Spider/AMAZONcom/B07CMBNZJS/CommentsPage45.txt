The dress is Beautiful, unfortunately it was big on me. Which I was happy  means that I'm losing weight. Yay! :) I am returning it only because I'll have to order a size smaller.  I might wait for a few weeks to see what size I need to order. But I was very impressed!


this dress was wayyyyyy to small either it ran really small or was miss marked!!!


Love the dress, love the price and the fit is perfect! Very very happy! One less thing to worry about four my daughter's wedding.


Perfect bridesmaid dresses.I would suggest ordering I size larger if you have a heavy chest.


I brought this dress to wear on my intimate wedding day. Dress fit well I normally wear a 10/12 in clothing but I purchase the dress in a size 16 because I have large breast. I was hesitate that the dress wouldn't fit because of my chest but it fits fine. Looking forward to wear my dress on my special day


I love the dress but it is too small


This was a beautiul dress for my wedding but there was issue with the zipper.  Found myself having difficulties getting the zipper up after the dress was on it was a real struggle. Although I did not want my husband to see tje dress I had to have him assist me there was a point of scare when we thought it was not going to work but we pulled it off and we were married. I received many compliments on the dress. The bust area was very low cut but I didnt mind it.


Fits perfectly as ordered from the size chart.  The dress is very well made.


Very good


Zipper has a tendency to get stuck and I think it was made for push up bras or something, cause my girls don't sit that high normally, but it looks awesome.
