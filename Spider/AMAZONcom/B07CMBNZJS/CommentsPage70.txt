I would like to exchange this for the color I ordered (purple) without having a fee attached to it or having to pay return postage.  The seller acknowledged that I had received the wrong color, please just send me the right color so we can straighten this out.  I would like to take care of this ASAP


I got a lot of compliments from the guys how beautiful I looked.  It fit great and look sexy on me.


Too small

This item was to be a size 12 but somehow fits like a 10. I will be returning the dress for a full refund.


The dress is nice and beautiful. But sizing is wrong, need to order a size or 2 up.


It was too small.  Couldn't wear it.  Disappointed.


Thank you so much...


Beautiful dress!!! Just like in the picture!!!


I was really disappointed with this dress.  I received the dress, only to find that the zip was spoilt.  id not even have the chance to try on the dress.  I had to wear another dress to the wedding.  This was so disappointing and I was so pissed of that just decided not to buy from this seller any more.  I even decided not to do any review.  However, after thinking about it I decided  to do the review so that others would avoid the delimna that I faced.  I spent all this money for a dress that could not be worn and still cannot be work because I decide that I would not spend an additional sum of money on this dress when I already spent and lost over $50.


Please do not buy this dress, although it looks nice in picture, it is not worth it at the end.
