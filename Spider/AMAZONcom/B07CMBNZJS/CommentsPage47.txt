Was great


very happy with this dress, came in as described and fit perfectly .  I have recommended this company to my friends for future events.


Didnt like the side zipper--- Pretty material--- pretty dress---- Just not for me.


I love this dress :) It fits as expected and I received compliments all night about how great I looked in it.


Very good


one size bigger but beautiful dress..loved it.


Dress is very pretty and fits good. Had to alter the top so that it can be put on and off without dificulty.


Absolutely beautiful, but the bust was way too large.  Since I am not seamstress, I returned it.


Beautiful dress with a good fit. Fun and flattering.


My daughter is getting married and she love the way  it look's and I love the little train on the back of the dress
