Length and waist fit perfectly, the bust was just a little large


Nice dress!


I like the dress, however it seems to run a bit smaller.


I need a size 7for da woman and size 12for da man


Beautiful, flowing gown! The detailing on the upper back gave the dress that extra pizazz. It was very easy to wear.


Great dress


I AM THE ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN A SMALLER SIZE. I LOVED THIS DRESS BECAUSE I ALREADY BOUGHT THE GREEN AND NOW I GOT THE PURPLE.


Very nice
