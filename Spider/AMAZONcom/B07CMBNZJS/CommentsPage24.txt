Beautiful!


Fit too small & had to return it. It was pretty, though, & looks like the picture.


Nice dress but needed to go up a size


It was horrible. Didn't look at all like the picture. Not for people with larger breasts


This dress arrived damaged- the zipper up the side was broken. The zipper pull was only attached to one side of the zipper. How did they not check to see if the zipper worked before shipping it? So I returned it.


Everyone loves this dress on me.  It is elegant and fits too perfectly.  I don't like the zipper and need assistance zipping up but the fit is amazing once I get past that!!! Athenia H


I sent the dress back it was to small. The material was nice and the dresses had that flow feel to it. It was what I was looking for. They didn't have the size I needed so went with another dress. The top is very open and the cut is not for busty women.
