No stretch to the fabric. Buy two sizes bigger. What a disappointment


Perfect dress. I love it. If you have broad shoulders and a smaller waist it looks great! Follow the size chart. It is exactly right.


The length was short and I am 5'7 and the dress hit me at my ankle.


Very tight around the bust area. In a 34b, it runs small. Very pretty dress.


I wore this dress to a ball I got several compliments. It was stunning and I stood out there wasn't a lot of skin expose . The price was extremely affordable. For this dress wear a push up bra for more support.The only dislike the trail was hooking up on my shoe. My date kept on stepping on my dress. I'm 65" and I wore 5" heels and my dress was still dragging. You just have to look out for your train.


the dress was way too big in comparison the sizing chart.  a size 14 dress should really have been a 10.


It was sheer and see through and larger than the size chart indicated I used my measurements and bought accordingly however it was HUGE. The quality was poor and the fabric was too thin to be respectable for any formal event or even anything in public. Seriously!!! I could see through it! Also the pattern was odd, it's an awkward cut up top and has a lot more clevage than it appears and it sags and hangs oddly in all the wrong places. The company made me pay for shipping to return it.


Didn't fit properly but I did love the back flow of the dress.  It made me look older and the breast part was to large.  I am large breasted but it gave me a real grandmother look.


I got the white, and it's very see through. There is also a long train on the back which is not clearly pictured in the on-line photo. It's allright, not great, but fine.


Its perfect, I love it, thank u
