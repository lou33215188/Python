Too small have to return... Yuck


I purchased this dress for my mothers 50 th bday party and she looked so beautiful in it. Only complaint is that it is intended for bustier women.


I ordered this dress for my thirty year class reunion. It's hasn't taken place yet. I like it better in the picture,  on the model. just hope that it win over all that I'm trying to impress!


Beautiful dress, but just as most of the reviews said the satin band is too tight and it came very wrinkled. The breast area is also too loose.  Too bad, I loved it.


Nice dress, but run small.


GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS. FIT AMAZING, A TAD LONG BUT I AM ONLY 5'4". WORE A HIGHER HEAL TO MAKE UP FOR IT. NO ONE COULD BELIEVE I ONLY PAID $32.00 ( FLASH DEAL). WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AND MAKER AGAIN.


Way too tight in bust!


I'm about 5'5", 127lbs, size 36B.  I ordered the purple one, sizes 6 and 8, size 8 fit great.  No bra needed since bust area is padded. Goes with 2-3" heels but higher heels will be okay too.  Well made dress. Very impressed.  Zipper is a bit hard to zip, needed help to zip it all the way up.  Low cut but not too bad - look at the picture with the black gown for a closer look.  Nice fabric. I would buy another dress from "Ever Pretty" again.  Fast delivery.  Easy return.  Good luck with your shopping!


I was so nervous guessing my size on line. .my dress fits perfectly. .just love it can't wait for another event to order another. ..


Great dress for the price. Use it for a photoshoot and photos turned out beautiful.
