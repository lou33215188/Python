The reviews are very helpful and the dress is exactly what I expected it to be. Extremely pleased with the purchase. It does have a train though! I missed that when I purchased the dress.


I love this dress, its beautiful  on me and true to size.  Its perfect for the occasion, and fits perfectly.


For the price this is a very pretty dress. I wore this to my courthouse wedding and it was perfect. There is a slight train in the back which I thought was lovely. Just a few things to keep in mind;


It is shear! You will need to wear something under it like a slip....I wore a nude colored fitted, skirt slip (fr Target) and it was perfect!


It will come wrinkled so give yourself time to have it steamed!


I am typically a size 4-6 so I ordered a size 6 based on the measurement chart. Bust is 34D. It took a little effort to zip the dress up. When it was zipped it was TIGHT...as in no bra required and my girls were pushed together tight! But I didn't think it was too low cut or "cleavy".


All in all very happy with the dress!


Dress was a perfect fit!  I went up a size based on previous comments.  So, thank you for those that posted.


The design was nice but it was too long, and the shoulder area was too wide.


but it was too small...


The dress was poorly made.  Came to me very off centered.


Omg this dress fits me so well I thought it would be too long but it's just right never thought shopping online for a dress would be so surprising good job amazon it is my wedding dress  am getting married in july and this is perfect for my budget, it's a courthouse wedding, praise the lord.


The dress is very nice but seemed to run small in the bust


Great quality
