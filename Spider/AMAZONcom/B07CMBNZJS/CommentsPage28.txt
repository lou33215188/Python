Bought it to wear to my brothers wedding...took a chance buying it at the last minute from Amazon because I was  frustrated with what I was finding at my local stores. So glad I got it fits perfect I am 5`9`` and length was perfect,  got so many compliments


Dress is very beautiful, was ordered for my daughters graduation.


This dress is Exactly like the pictures! I love it! I thought it would be a cheap material because of the price but it's beautiful! Thank you so much! Perfect dress for mother of the groom. ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜‰


Beautiful dress but too small and had to send it back


The sequins on the shoulders make it look a bit cheap. It'd look much nicer without them. But it fits as expected, I normally wear an 8 or 10 and purchased a 10 based on other reviewers comments with their busts feeling squashed. The 10 fits great, not too snug, not terribly loose.


I thought I was going to like this dress, but the back detail and where the material hits at the shoulders makes this dress a hard fit. I'm not broad shoulder, but I think if I was this dress might have looked better on. It is the kind of dress where only the right body type can wear it so don't be surprised if you get this and send it back.


What really got me was how tiny in the rib cage this was when zipping it up and how big (wide) it felt in the chest area and I'm a 38DDD. Like I said...this fits a certain body type and I'm an hourglass so I'm guessing you'll need to be more of a triangle (board shoulders with a tiny waist, hips and long legs). Anyway, I think this dress could be pretty on the right woman, but it wasn't for me.


Now the reason for the 2 stars. I was surprised this dress wasn't as nicely made as the other dresses I tried from Ever Pretty. This dress seemed a bit cheap to me and the swirling sequin pattern just looked like the dress wasn't over hundred dollars and that bothered me Sequins isn't expensive and I'm not sure why they used a lower quality of sequins on this dress.


this dress was a hit at the wedding, when I wore it , it fits perfect the size, the length and the look of the picture is exactly what I got ,great job on portraying the dress.


Dress was very nice and sexy. I give it 4 stars because I am 5'6 and the dress was to long in the front and u couldn't tell that it was suppose to be short in the front so I had alterations done to it in the front and I am very happy. I where a 10 in dresss but because I am big busted on top I had to get a 14 and it was great...


Very pleased with my purchase. I was looking for an inexpensive dress that would be worn once or maybe twice; but attractive looking. It's all about what accessories you wear with the dress and a little alteration here and there to get your perfect fit. I read most of the negative reviews to find out why the consumer was not pleased with the dress. So I figured, if you're looking for a $300 dress for the price of $70 then don't purchase; otherwise, it's a very nice dress.


Love the gown but the bust was just too tight. If you have a small to medium bust line, this dress should fit fine. It's a shame because it is so pretty, but I had to return it.
