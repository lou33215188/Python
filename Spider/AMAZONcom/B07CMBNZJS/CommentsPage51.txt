Color Green:  the color is lovely.  the dress runs at least two sizes two small! both my bridesmaids are tiny 1 a size 2/4  ( ordered dress size 4  )and the other a size 6/8 (ordered dress size 8) and  Both dress had the same issues BOTH Girls could NOT zip up the backs of there dresses.


 the cap sleeves on the dresses also made both girls shoulders appear to be broad,  Both dresses were returned and a different style was purchased.. Note: this dress seems to wrinkle very easy, and absolutely runs small be sure to order one or 2 sizes UP.


Beautiful gown but it doesn't fit good


If it wasn't for the reviews I would not have bought this dress.  Gorgeous, true to color, true to size, a little big in the top and a little long but still absolutly stunning!!


Well made, comfortable, nice champagne color.


Beautiful dress.


My girlfriend likes it


beautiful dress fits - a bit low in front but we can fix that with a lacy under thing =)


Great dress fitted as expected. Love the dress!
