Beautiful dress. It came with a hole was a bit disappointed. I was able to get it fixed. None the less its a gorgeous dress.


Very nice dress, but I had to return it because size 12 was too big for me. Also, I'm 6 feet tall and the dress wasn't long enough for me. I like it a lot, but not for me!


fits well great buy


I bought this in size #10 but got the size of a #16.


You need to be careful before buying.


beautiful dress


Dress is a little bit too small. Material is nice, but the dress overall is see through. It's ok, but not great


Great fit and just as in the photo


Lovely!

Not exactly what I expected.  But what a wonderful  dress.
