I agree with everyone who said there is a LOT of cleavage showing!  The dress hem is shorter in the front and has a mini train in the back.  Not appealing to me because the dress looks too short in the front.  Otherwise comfortable and love the color.


This is a beautiful dress.  It is very long.  I wasn't expecting it to be so long.


This dress is just built weird. There isn't enough space between the shoulders and the chest. The chest part was just up way too high. The chiffon was pretty though but the top part of the dress was just crap.


I did not get to wear it to the event for which I purchased because I got very ill but the dress is still in my closet and I plan to wear to an event next month. Looks beautiful on me!


This dress was perfect for my daughters home coming formal. It was beautiful the pics don't do it justice.


Beautiful dress! Good materials at an unbelievable price. Got compliments on it. I ordered a size 12 and it fit me, im a D cup and i felt that it gave me the support that i needed.


The wrong size was ordered, so obviously it was too small, but that was because we ordered a 4 and not the 6 we needed. The other Ever Pretty dress I ordered was spot on, size-wise.


Low price, low quality material, but it's not awful.


My favorite gown I own... I would order a size up. Perfect!!


Beautiful dress.  Even pretier in person.


Got this for a formal night on a cruise. I loved it! Fits as expected. I got a size 10 and that's what I usually wear. If you're busty you may want to go up a size.
