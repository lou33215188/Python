way to big for me, price was very good and the dress was constructed well.


I love this dress! The bodice fit perfectly and it was very flattering.  It does have a bit of a train, so be careful when walking in a crowd!


It is a great quality dress, the sizing is just a bit on the small size. I loved the dress I really did it just did not fit right.


The first was too small so it was returned for the next size up.


loved the dress


Dress fits perfectly...was beautiful....got it for my mom to wear to my wedding


I was very worried about buying online but with free two day shipping I was able to take a chance still have 3 weeks before cruise. no need to return it its a beautiful fit the color is more on the maroon side witch is perfect. I would definitely recommend you purchase this you will be very happy and look elegant.


It's at least 2 sizes to small.  And we didn't realize until it showed up that it had a train to it.  From the pictures we believed that it was a floor length dress all the way around.


I gave this dress a 4 star because I loved it and especially all the glitter and sparkle.  However, it was too large and I was working on a tight time frame.  It is a beautiful dress if you can get your right size.


need some adjustments
