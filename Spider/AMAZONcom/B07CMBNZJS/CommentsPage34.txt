Beautiful dress. Was going to wear for my wedding but it was too small.


Sleeves don't lay across the shoulders the way it looks on the model.  Instead of fitting over the top of the arm it slides the 'sleeve' slides over to the shoulder.


My wife loved the dress.  I loved how my wife looked in the dress.  The low price was icing on the cake.  The quality of manufacture blew away my low expectations for a $50 dress.  We definitely recommend this dress!


This dress is much prettier than in the pinture, well tailored and the gold  lines are very delicate, the dark green color is beautiful, I would recommend it.


I bought this as a gift for a friend who was getting married. She absolutely loved it.


Very good quality and well worth the money.


Okay if you are tall with a very large bust...will be returning


Beautiful dress, sadly it was tight around the bust


The color was off and the dress was too large. I had to return it.


Looks good on wife


It is a beautiful dress but it was large in the chest.
