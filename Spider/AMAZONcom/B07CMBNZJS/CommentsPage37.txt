Love it but just a little to big in the bust


gorgeous dress, feels good on, but very low cut bust


Too small. The dress is beautiful. The material is not top dollar, but it really is a pretty dress. Im 5'3 165lbs with 38B/C. The first order was a size 14. There was no hope of zipping the (VERY AWKWARD!!) side zipper. So I exchanged it for a 16. Still no luck on the zip up. You HAVE TO HAVE another person to help you zip this dress. It was still too tight but I have been losing weight quick, (there is hope). So I have 3 weeks until I need to wear the dress and I am hoping it will fit just right (with a little suck in and tuck lol) If they had a 18 in black I would have exchanged it again. I returned it on a Friday (the same day I got it) and ordered the bigger size. Had the new dress by Monday and the refund for the other on Thursday. So the turn around time was not to bad at all. I have never had to order a dress with a number size, I stick to letters! (They are usually more comfortable) So the reviews that state order what size you normally are in jeans.... nope. Just beware the zipper is in the worst spot ever so have someone with you to help zip up!


Dress wss too big but I had it taken up and it fits great.


Small in the bust.


made my day - very pretty and got lots of positive feedback on wedding day


This is a beautiful dress -- but it was too small.  I usually run about a 16 normally... and it was beautiful on, but I could not zip it!  It is incentive for me to loose weight though so I can order it again next year and wear it to my work Christmas party.


Just a note, as expected, when you unwrap it, it will be very wrinkly because of the material.. but it is def a georgous dress!


Beautiful dress


Just too long...


Exchanged for a bigger size looks lovely . I would recommend this to anyone , fast service got here just in time . Love it .
