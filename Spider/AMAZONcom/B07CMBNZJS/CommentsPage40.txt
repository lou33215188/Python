needed to be hemmed up as it was very long, otherwise fit was perfect.


Loved the dress but again too small.


Beautiful dress!  The first dress I ordered was too small in the bust. I returned it with ease and re-ordered 1 size up. It is perfect now!  I'd buy from this seller again. Thanks!!!


A bit long for me but I was really satisfied with the price and shipping time ğŸ˜€


Beautiful, comfy love it!


Too small, but the fabric and dress was really nice, only wish that it was the right fit


I was nervous that the I would not be able to zip the side up.  When I got the dress I was very excited that I could, however the one area that was surprised didn't fit was the chest area.  This dress was about 1" too large on top for a sz16.  Otherwise I love the dress


This dress will be worn to my daughter's wedding.  It fits true to size and is just beautiful.  The back has a small train and looks as good as the front.  I love it!


All is perfect I am very happy because the product is beautiful and the size is the correct and  look so nice thanks


It was great and look like the picture, loving it
