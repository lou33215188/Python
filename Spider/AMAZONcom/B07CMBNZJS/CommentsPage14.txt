Very pretty...it just wasn't my granddaughters style.  I do think the dress is well worth the cost!


cheaply made and zipper was broke


Had to reorder because dress runs small. Another mix up because the wrong dress was sent but the company reshipped quickly. Would order from them again. I did actually order another dress from them but kept in mind they run small and ordered the next size. Fits very well and a great deal for the price.


It was beautiful dress but it showed way too much cleavage for me so we sent it back other than that it's a great dress


Not as expected


The dress was beautiful, but way too small for me. I wear a medium in everything, and this wasn't even close to fitting.


My daughter loves this dress. She's only 12 so it's a little big around the chest, but she needs the length.  Should be pretty easy to alter the top for her.


Color and fit are as expected.


Great dress! Fit perfect, kind of long, but that's fine since I wore heels. Also, it does have a bit of a train. It might look just OK, but when you wear it, it's really nice. I got so many compliments and my cousin actually bought it for herself she loved it that much.


The dress is fit in size as per the size chart provided by manufacturer.  The material is soft and the dress is simple and elegant.  The packaging may need to be enhanced as I received the dress and the wrapping nylon bag was open. But other than that, the dress is super!


The dress looks good, however even if I measure my self it didn't fit, l have to go a size upper than my normal size
