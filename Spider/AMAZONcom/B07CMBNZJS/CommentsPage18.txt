Dress is beautiful but the bodice was a bit tight despite the fact that I followed the measurement guide and bought one size up.


Beautiful dress just too small for me.


I loved the gown & design .. but I am usually a size 6 so to be safe I ordered a size 8.. bust/chest area would not zip up.. it was too tight.. length was long, shoulders were slightly big but rest was small


The dress was pretty but I had to return it. I could of sworn the one I looked at didn't say juniors in it so it was really small for me. Also my husband didn't like the style. Had to return.


The breast cups didn't fit right.


The size is not what expected


Very elegant dress! It was perfect for my daughters prom.  The color and fit was as expected.  The dress came folded up in a small packaged that wrinkled the dress but we found that using a hot blow dryer would quickly released the wrinkles. I would definitely buy here again!


lovely dress but it's not fitting me quite well.


Ordered a 6 but too large, got a 4, perfect, beautiful dress, worn for Prom.


it fit weird on my shoulder so  I returned it. also the back looks cheap material
