I  wore the evening dress in black to daughter's wedding and received numerous compliments.  Everyone asked where did i buy it and i told them amazon and they were shocked.  Low cleavage but very classy.  Suggest wearing dressy slip/satin v under dress.  I will rewear on another occassion.


Lots of beautiful fabric. Well made.  Runs large so I am returning.  FYI - Has a train in back which didn't show in pictures.


The back where the sequins are seemed a little too big. Had to pin it over - but with my hair down you couldn't tell.


Must be for a little bit bustier women. :)


Otherwise it fit well, and I received a lot of compliments. (was used as a wedding dress)


Flowed nicely!


Dress was very pretty, but does run small, so I would order up two sizes.  The dress did arrive quickly and return was easy.


It arrived quickly and looked good. The size ran a little big for an 8 and sewn in cups were a little crushed. But over all for the price a nice dress


Is a beautiful dress but runs small


Im 115 pounds and small is perfect


This dress is beautiful. However, it is a bit small in the bust. We are using these as brides maids dresses, and while I'm am busty and always order a size larger to accommodate, the other two also ran small in this area (for two teenagers). Still very happy with them, just order with this in mind.


This dress is just perfect, I'm so impressed, very good quality


I love the dress but the bust area is small. I can work around it but you cant wear a bra with it. Now I have to get the back alter into a corset.
