Beautiful dress but cut way smal


Really thin fabric and almost see through!


Fit well. Quality fabric and beautiful colors.


Well made dresses, I want every colour for my grand daughter.


The material was a little sheer.


My little niece loved it


Great dress!


This dress is just beautiful.  The material is so soft and the colors are gorgeous.  Planning on having my granddaughter wear it for her 2nd birthday.  Seems to run a little large but it is absolutely adorable.


Nice dress, good quality, and is reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend it to others to purchase it.


This dress is adorable. I can't wait for my girls to wear them at Easter. I would buy it again and I probably will be picking up the other colors.
