The dress was cute and fits perfectly. However, be aware, that it took over a month for it to be delivered from China. I am not sure what the issue was, but it arrived a month after the expected delivery date.


Too cute and perfect for my active girl.


Poor material!


I bought size 6 but it seems small to my four years old who is tall! Normally six will fit her very well but this one she will not wear it for two months before she outgrows it!


A beautiful dress sent on to my Granddaughter's who loves it!


My daughter loved the dress. Comfortable fit and nice design


Nice and pretty, just as photo. Woekmanship and material is good for a price.


A little large but I have no problem. .she will grow into it.


Its a cute dress, I order a size 10 a bit small. She typically wears 10, material is not of great quality but for the price is ok.


This dress is absolutely beautiful. Well made and good material.


HAPPY WITH THE DRESS, I WOULD SUGEST OTHER PEOPLE TO BUY.
