Beautiful dress but bows came off pretty quickly.


It's beautiful and my daughter loves it.  It fits exactly as I thought it would. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that it's a little thin,  so you'll want to make sure the undies aren't a bold color/ pattern


Granddaughter loves very light and cool


Super cute dress .  Great quality
