The quality is not the best and will not help much in the desired shape of the dress. It falls flat on the skirt part.


Smaller than says; order larger.


Beautiful dress for our granddaughter.


great


This has been worked out so well for my friend's little girl. It fits perfectly!!! The daughter loves this dress and others I have purchased.


Adorable dress and well made.  I have not taken them out of the packaging yet as they are gifts for less unfortunate child.  The dress appears to be lined.  This was well worth the wait.  This is shipped directly from China, so be sure that you leave plenty of time when ordering.


Nice dress. The material is good, not too cheap. It fits great on my 3 year old. Got her a 4-5. My girl is tall and slim.


Looks great on my daughter


A little snug so my daughter will wear it a couple times before handed to another kid


Tracking the shipping was a bit hard as this prodtcame from China


Nice dress for the price.  The bow is held by a single loop so by the end of the day, as my 3 year old ran around, hummed and played it feel off somewhere.  The dress fabric is on the thin side.  Overall it's cute but not something to be super excited for.


Okay quality for the price.
