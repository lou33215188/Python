Beautiful dress


I bought this item as a gift it is a nice looking dress but I was really disappointed in the quality of the material is no paperweight  more like kite material  I had to buy a slip to go under the dress before shipping the gift


Awsome Dress!  True to size and clour!  Looks lovely on my granddaughter!


The dress is cute, but not the quality I had hoped for.  It is very thin which will be okay for the summer, but I will have to make sure there is a slip underneath.
