Love this dress, very well made; however its a tad snug so my daughter cant wear it.


Dress is okay. Not very good quality. Print kooks digitally printed with bad pixel image.


Do not buy. It ripped after the first wear. Flimsy


My daughther love it. Beautiful. very good for the price


We love these dresses!!!


I was very pleased with this dress....nice colors and the fit was awesome. I would definitely buy again!


Pretty dress--I ordered a size larger and it fit my granddaughter perfectly.


Dress is very cute & fits great, little long, but she is growing.  She wears it 2 days a week now, but if she had her way she would wear it everyday, change clothes every 30 minutes to try on the others.


Love it is true to size and beautiful.


I ordered the pink looking one and it's not pink it's more of a peachy color :(
