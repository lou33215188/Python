I bought this dress for my niece. It is so cute. She's 8 and on the tiny side, the 7 fit her and she loved it!


Ordered big cause it's from China. Turned out I got the size I ordered. Had to return but it's a cute dress.


Not true to American size. Made for Chinese girls. And could not be returned for exchange.  Will never order from you again


Cute dress. Just unsure why this has a tan tone in it when the other colors do not.


Love it....I was expecting to be too little, but fits perfectly


to small cheap martial not even worth giving it as a gift my daughter is a large and that would even go over her head


PERFECT!  Loved it for Easter/parties - and what a great price!  Material is nice - cotton.  Truly lovely


My daughter loves this dress! Itâ€™s a bit big but the detail is beautiful


I bought this in size 4/5 for my 3 year old and it barely fit. Definitely runs small. Very beautiful dress.


ended up giving away because it cost what i paid to ship back. sizes are not true to size and run way smaller than actual size.
