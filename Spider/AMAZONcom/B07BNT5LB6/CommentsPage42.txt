bow was not sewn well, so we lost it first time wearing.


Beautiful Dress, Fit nicely.  I didn't give it a lot of stars because it didn't hold up well to washing.  It didn't "fall apart" like some other dresses I have purchased online; with tool-ish fabric.  I would suggest washing this dress by hand.  The fabric is nice, soft cotton.


The fit was just as the chart stated. What I like most is that it washed and the colours remained vibrant and the fabric didn't look old or used as some cotton dresses often do.


Granddaughter is very happy with her dress, very pretty


Beautiful dress. My grand-daughter loves it!


The dress fit well, my granddaughter is so happy with it


You can return these but the cost to return is the same as the cost of the dress


It's pretty BUT the material is odd. It doesn't iron well. It looks wrinkly no matter what setting I use on the iron.


Fits perfectly, the dress is of good quality and my granddaughter loves it. The colors are vibrant, her favorite colors of purple


This dress is even prettier than depicted online.
