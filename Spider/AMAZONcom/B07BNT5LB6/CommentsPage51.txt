The zipper in the back feels cheap and seems like it will break soon! Other than that absolutely BEAUTIFUL


Sweet dress for little girls. My daughter loves the colors, it is very girlie. The material is soft and the bottom flows nicely when she walks or twirls. Sees happy so I am happy.


Dress is super nice, however size is smaller than American standards. It got too tight to my daughter


Beautiful and fits perfectly


Absolutely gorgeous!!  She looks lovely in this!!!!!!!


It's fine that it was a little big they will wear them longer.....


This dress fit my grand-daughter well and was adorable on her.


Very pretty ! Vibrant colors and looks beautiful


very pretty dress next time I will order a larger size if available absolutely no growing room but it is really pretty


This is a nice dress. My daughter wears it pretty often and gets complimented on it when she does. Made as well as any other kids dress.
