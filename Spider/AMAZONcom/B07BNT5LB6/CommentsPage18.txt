It fit but the fabric had a tear in it from the get go. There was frayed threads along the seams. very thin fabric


bought this for my niece. she loves it!!


Good quality. The size grid is responsible. Print as in the photo.


I ordered four of these dresses (different color and style of course) and they all came in perfect condition.  My daughter's jaw dropped when she saw them.  She loves each one.  We bought these for her to wear in our upcoming vacation to the Caribbean.  The quality is very good for the price.


Very pretty


This was the perfect dress for my granddaughter who was the flower girl in her cousin'd wedding. The colors were purple and cream so this was so pretty with the other members of the wedding party. The bows look a bit oddly placed for me but she didn't seem to notice. I would have given the dress 5 stars except it must be hand washed and line dried, then ironed. A lot of work in these busy times.


Good


Nice dress. Good quality. Looked great on my daughter. True to size.


My niece absolutely loves this dress! She opened up the present and put it on right away! The fabric is made so that it breathes and isn't too hot when wearing on a hot day.  Well made! Defiantly recommend this dress!


My 5 year old granddaughter loves this dress. She is petite and the dress fits her perfectly. She can't wait to wear it!  I will be purchasing more Sunny Fashion dresses for her!
