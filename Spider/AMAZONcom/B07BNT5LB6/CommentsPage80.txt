As described


love it, came in time for my granddaughter's birthday.  fits perfect.


This dress is absolutely beautiful.  Great price too!


This was a gift, and she loved it.


The material is a little thinner than I expected, but it looks exactly like the picture. I did order a size up because of other reviews, and it fits my daughter perfectly with a little room to grow- though she is very tall and thin. I also washed it in cold water on the"delicate" cylcle and dryed it on "no heat"  in the dryer, cycle, and the colors did not run. My daughter is very excited to wear it for Easter.


Perfect fit, look,  quality,  and early arrival


Very pretty, bright colors.


Nice colors very well made


the size is perfect, and quality, the fabric is thick, so you will need to wear something else under.


We love it
