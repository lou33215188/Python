Looks great


My daughter and I both loved the dress. It is simple and very pretty. She loved great on Easter Sunday!


Fooled by the price. The fabric looks more expensive than it actually is. I bought a much better quality dress at sears for $10. Disappointed because I feel like I could have bought a dress from a competitor for $5 and gotten my money's worth.


Beautiful, simply sewn


Fits as expected. Size 6 slightly large on just turned5 approx 40#.


the truth that you are shopping for Christmas and my wife's face is all in correct order


This is my daughters favorite dress. It fits her perfectly.


I like it

The dress came in time and it was as expected and as shown in the picture. A good buy for my granddaughter for her birthday . She loves purple and this one compliments it. Very nice .


Darling outfit! I did have to iron it but that's just me! I would recommend it to anyone who likes to dress their princess up!


This dress is gorgeous and very well made. The zipper in the back doesnâ€™t even show and the craftsmanship is excellent. The material is thin and I would recommend a slip for cooler weather, but the dress is lined.
