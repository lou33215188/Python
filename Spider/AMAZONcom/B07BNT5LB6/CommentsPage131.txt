The dress is cute.  But make sure you size up.  I checked the reviews and bought a size bigger for my daughter and it fits well with a little bit of room to grow.  The dress is shipped directly from China.  The cut/sizing is smaller than North American cuts.  Of the three dresses I bought, this one was a tad bigger than the others, but not by much.


We bought a size 12...it was too small. My daughter may only be able to wear it once.


I loved the costume, it's very beautiful and wonderful. That described in the picture came exactly, colors and size is very appropriate Thanks for the piece, a happy experience.


This was in size 11-12. The girl wearing it is 13 but she is small for her age. She normally wears 10-12 or sometimes smaller. She could barely even squeeze into this!!! Don't buy!!!!


Dress is very chessy looking. The dress looks nothing like picture. Very disappointed in dress.


All fit perfectly


It was poor quality and size was too small, I had ordered a 5 size but it was more of 3 sized
