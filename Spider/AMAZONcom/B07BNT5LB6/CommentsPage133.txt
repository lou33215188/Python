Does NOT look like picture. Color less vibrant. Material cheap


Poor quality


Poor quality and was not the same dress that was ordered. Dress came apart after one wash. Bows were held on with a hot glue gun.


Very Poor


Pictures mask the real quality, very dullish white with no sheen.


Not good


The material for the dress is very cheap, supposed to be cotton but it is not.  Don't buy this dress.


I ordered 4/5 and a three got both same size. I feel they were make cheap and thin. Not sure if I would ever order again


Love  it


Great buy,fits perfect
