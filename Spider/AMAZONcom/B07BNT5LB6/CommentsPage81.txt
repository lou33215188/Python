Exactly how it looked in photo


Really nice dress!


I wish I had the option for no star..


I bought these for my nieces for their birthday. The material used is of extremely cheap quality. After one wash the dresses were ripped off like someone did it intentionally. I regret buying these. I recommend all customers reading this , not to buy such stuff online.


They look pretty in first place but are not worth spending money and shipping for this cheap quality. Kids' dresses material should be durable as they get dirty after wearing for a couple of times.


The manufacturer should atleast make the better quality cloth instead of deceiving customers by writing about product which is actually not true.


if you have a skinny child fine- if your daughter wide across shoulders or chest- wont fit-


very good quality and fast delivery


Nice! I will order more "sunny fashions" for my 7-year old granddaughter.


This is the only dress fitted to my daughter (7 years old) of the 8 dresses ordered. Among the 8, this is the moderately good quality product.


Beautiful dress!


Pretty dress for my girl. She love it.
