It's my 2nd year buying these kind of dresses, my very girly daughter loves them and she get lots of compliments.  She's a tall 3 1/2 year old and I get her size 4 or 4-5.


This dress is so cute on. My daughter loves it.


Beautiful dress. But definitely runs too small. My daughter is 8 years old, and she usually wears size 9/10. Because I read other reviews I decided to buy this dress size 11-12. The dress fits her just right, but she won't be able to wear it for long. Other than running small, it is a beautiful spring/summer dress. They come with lining, for me that's a plus.


Real Nice.


This dress is lovely and you can't beat the price.  I love the pattern and color.  Thank you.


just perfect !!


I was very pleased with these dresses.  They are beautifully made and look much more expensive than they were. Also they were a perfect fit and were received promptly in excellent condition.


Purchased for a wedding for my 3 year old.  Thin material, but super cute and cool for a hot summer's day!


Great Gift


Light and beautiful. Perfect for spring.
