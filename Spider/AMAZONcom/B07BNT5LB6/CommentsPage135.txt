Really lovely dress, and my granddaughter looked smashing in it.  The price was great and it was made surprisingly well.  I was and am very pleased.  I'll order again from these people and would reccommend them to others.


I bought this pretty dress for my great-niece.  She loves it,  and it fits perfectly.  She was just 8 in July.  She really loves the sterling silver lavender dragonfly necklace.  She wouldn't take it off.  She wants to wear it everyday.  LOL.


Love Amazon!


great for summer!


very cute, all 100% cotton - will require ironing each time laundered/worn


This is her favorite dress, it's light and in expensive.  I want basic dresses she could wear to school and could get dirty.


Perfect.


Pretty, ordered 4 dresses total, I would order again.


She loved it, and it looked soooo cute!!


Nice fit.


Very pretty but way too short


Material was good ,but it's small in size?


My granddaughter receive her dress and tried it on so we could see her at her house. She liked the flare and colors.
