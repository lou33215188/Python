Cotton dress very pretty. My only complaint is I just received the dress on 4/15/16, Wonder why it took saw long, came from China, not what I suspected. Looks pretty on my grand daughter.


I like it but It is not lined and when it arrives it has alot of wrinkles and is very hard to iron but over all it is a beautiful dress


VERY PRETTY DRESS


My granddaughter sent me a thank you card, she liked her new purple floral dress so much.  She is four years old.


This dress was so beautiful i means just perfect our daughter loves and looks so southern in it. sooooo cute


perfect she said


My niece loved it!


At first, I was worried, my luck in the past with items that are shipped from China... Let me tall you this, it is a great looking dress, well done, and the fabric is good stuff.


Color as pictured but material is very thin. Nice summer dress.


This was ordered for a 3T but definitely more of a 4T but a beautiful dress never the less. Good for spring and summer.
