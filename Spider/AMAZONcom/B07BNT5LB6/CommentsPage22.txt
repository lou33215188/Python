My foster child in Uganda loved this for her birthday.


The dress is nice but a lot darker on the bottom. Actually it is brown on the bottom. My daughter in fact loves the dress.


Pretty, well made, and a great price. The colors are vibrant, and the quality of the fabric and construction is excellent.


Great for parties. Got this for my 4 year old as well. Beautiful spring dress.


Bought as a gift.  Little girl loved it and looked very cute !!


Very cute dress however after one wash and one of the bows was completely ripped off.


Love the dress on my Granddaughter- wore it for graduation from Kindergarten!


Perfect dress for my 8 year olds birthday party.  She loved it and to my surprise she got teal frosting on it and it washed right out. Great fit, great material and a great price.


Such a cute dress and perfect for Easter.


Asian size runs small! Beautiful dress
