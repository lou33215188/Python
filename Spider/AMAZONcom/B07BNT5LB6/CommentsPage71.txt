nice dress but looks kind of cheap.

Hard to fit by age. I ordered 9-10 age said to fit 10-12 definitely more like size 10


Perfect for price. But it's lining is see through.


cute


The dress is cute. It is shipped straight from China, so I am a little worried about the quality.. only time will tell.


Granddaughter loves it.


Nice dress with a liner. My great granddaughter wore it at my wedding
