granddaughter loved this dress


Very pretty. Good buy for the price. Fits well.


Sorry


Pleased with the purchase.  Great little dress for the price.  And there is a lightweight slip sewn in.


Easy to wear. Very comfortable & pretty on girls...we bo't 2 sizes to coordinate. Girls were so cute. The built-in slip made it perfect for wearer and the look. Care will take some effort as it does wrinkle badly in laundry. With quick removal from dryer and light press with iron, we are good to go!


This dress look dinch the white look brown


perfect only
