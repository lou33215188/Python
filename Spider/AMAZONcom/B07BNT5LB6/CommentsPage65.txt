My granddaughter loved them


Very Beautiful dress. Sizes are way off!! Too small to much hassle to return. Gave it away.


Gorgeous. We get so many compliments.


The dress fit as expected. My neice loves it, nice and light for summer & easily layered for winter weather.


she loved it


Does not seems like cotton or may be a low quality of cotton is used.


Perfect fit.


Very nice dress, sits just right.
