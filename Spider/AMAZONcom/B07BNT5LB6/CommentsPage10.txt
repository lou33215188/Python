Although it was too small for the intended child to wear, I gave it to a more petite child instead and it fit her great. Cute dress


The bows came off after my daughter wore it for two hours and it does not have enough materials for me to sew it back on.


Couldn't beat the price! I know this will be a favorite, come Spring and Summer!


It is a really beautiful dress. My kid got a lot of awes.


Such a sunny, pleasant dress! Made well and the colors were vibrant. Would buy again and again.


I bought this dress for my Daughter's birthday, she was turning 8 and does not like wearing shorts during the summer, but she will wear dresses. Unfortunately she has yet to wear it, but I can tell it is going to be a Beautiful dress in her


I knew from the picture that this is a dress I had to order for my daughter. It is made of good quality cotton and the purple butterfly and floral pattern against the white background is beautiful. When she saw the dress, she couldnâ€™t wait to put it on.


It looks just like the picture. The stitching is neatly done. There's a lining to the dress. I am impressed with the overall workmanship.  There's even an invisible zipper.....nicely done! The only thing I need to do is press it.


My 9 year old loves this dress!  Light and summery.


So pretty I would like to see more different designs but good quality great price
