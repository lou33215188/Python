Love, love this dress. It's colors are vibrant and the material is soft.


This dress is even cuter in person. The colors are vibrant and it has a little twirl to it. It is however much thinner material than i expected, definitely a summer dress or a dress needing a sweater and such for a cooler day. The size is perfect! Size Fits like clothes from the childrens place. Overall, for the price im extremely happy with the dress and more important my daughter loves it!


Love it

I got this beautiful dress for my eight years old daughter and she loves it.  I took a size bigger as I was not sure how it would fit and it is perfect.
