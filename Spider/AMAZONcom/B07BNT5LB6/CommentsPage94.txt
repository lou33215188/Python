Excellent condition. Perfect. .ty


She loves the dress.


TOO SMALL BUT A NICE DRESS... WILL BUY BIGGER SIZE NEXT TIME FOR MY 9 YEAR OLD


nice


It was for a 10 years girl but it fit in a 7 years old girl.


The dress is beautiful. My daughter wears a size 7/8 and this dress fit her perfectly. The material is a very light cotton. It does wrinkle easily, so have an iron handy.


Fit well and looks adorable on.


Is good an good price for everyone
