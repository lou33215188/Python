This is a beautiful spring dress. We all loved the quality and the material. It twirls as my grand baby twirls around. She loves the purple flowers.  I would recommend it to anyone who has girls in the family.


Bought as a gift, my niece loves this dress!


Nice quality sun dress. Just a bit short that's all. My daughter decided to wear them with leggings.


This is a wonderful dress very well made.true to size quick shipping.


I have received two dresses from this company and I have to say that I was very surprised at the fine quality, especially for the price! I will definitely buy from them again. Yes, I do really recommend this company and look forward to buying more for my granddaughters!
