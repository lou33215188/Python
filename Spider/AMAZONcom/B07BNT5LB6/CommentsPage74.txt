Dress was excellent


I expected a different fabric a bit more heavy, but its a nice light fresh cotton dress. I just put on a cardigan or light sweater if needed. The area where we live calls for more sweaters. Dress is comfortable and light.


Thx gift was perfect


It's ok for the price


too small


good quality for the price! my 5yo girl just loved it so much!


great dress


Very nice quality.


The fit of this dress was somewhat too small for a size eight. The cotton is great but I was disappointed


SO PRETTY
