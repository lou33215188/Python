Hope my grand daughter will love it.


it shrunk when washed.


I only wish I didn't have to iron it- love the dress and holds up well to washing several times.


The tablet holder will not even hold the tablet in, just falls right out, I threw it the junk basket for the kids to play with.  It is the right size, the materials it is made out does not have enough strength to keep it in the frame. The pen still works even after most of the rubber rolled off.  Have not used the screen protectors as I already had ordered some before this order.


Good intentions, just bad quality.


My daughter love this dress. Bought it for her picture day at school and couldn't be happier with it. Highly recommended :)


Compares well with big name mall shops. Fits well extremely pretty and girly.


ordered 2 sizes larger, was perfect


Beautiful dress. Fits wonderfully and is of good quality.


nice


Granddaughter loved the dress, fit as expected. We would definitely buy again!
