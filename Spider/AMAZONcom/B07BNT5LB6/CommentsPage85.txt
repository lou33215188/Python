Love it


Dress was crap way too small rip the first time it was put on


Love everything about this dress. My daughter looked beautiful in it .


She looked gorgeous


Bought this for my four year old granddaughter who loved it.  She is very tall and slim so the bodice was slightly large but not so that she couldn't wear it.  Very nice dress for the price.

Bought for grand daughter, she loved it.


Nice summer dress. Comfortable. Bought for my daughter's pre-kinder graduation. She looked pretty and girly. We both loved it.
