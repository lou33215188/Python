It's a beautiful dress. My only issue was shipping. It took longer than expected.


Pretty spring dress.


Little girl loves it.


The dress is very cute but I'm having a hard time getting the packaging wrinkles out.


I thought it was beautiful.


It is a little thin so instead of a slip I got her a fancy pair of laced bloomers to wear under it. I really like it except for that.


Good quality


The dress material is thin, requires a slip


Gorgeous dress and not expensive but makes my granddaughter feel like a princess


Prettier than any picture.  The butterflies on the dress are so colorful.  Way cute.
