So happy to by this product. High quality and a good size.


Not the material expected but pretty anyway...my grand loved it. She will wear it many times for different religious activities.


Good quality.


precious dress..looks very pretty on my beautiful granddaughter


Grand daughters love it


Very cute dress, however the fabric is quite thin and see through.  A slip will have to be worn underneath it.


beautiful dress, my 6 year old loves it and so do I, Fits beautifully with room to grow a little. beautiful quality
