LOVE THIS DRESS.


Colorful for any month of the year. Can be worn to church or birthday party or just visiting. I like 100% cotton for my granddaughter. Easy to wash and iron if necessary


the fabric is not high quality.  The bow comes off easily.  But my girls still like to war it.


This is the loveliest dress, made perfectly for any little princess!


Bought a size up based on reviews,  good advice. Very nice bright dress. Only problem was it wasn't lined underneath and its a thin dress.


I love it


It looks nicer in the picture. Actual material and color are so so.


ok


light lining inside. can not see through the dress.pictures can not describe its beauty. Its light and cool to wear.


Very cute. Daughter is 5 (almost 6) and average size. Dress in size 7/8 fit well.
