not bad for the price. I was on a real budget for the Easter dress this year. This is a good buy if you are on a budget.


These dresses are adorable - a little bigger around than her other dresses, but with a long sleeved shirt underneath now that the temperature is dropping for us, I'm sure she'll grow into it.


Good


It fit my 8 yr old perfectly. She is tall for her age so I got it a little bigger and I'm glad I did.


Very pretty dress, nice and breezy but it did fade when I washed it. I washed in cold water with a color brightener.


Perfect fit.


This was a birthday gift for my great granddaughter.  It made a big "hit" with her.  The dress is very pretty.


Perfect little pretty dress my daughter loves it .....i will be buying more...


Bought for coworker's daughter and she loves the look and the price.


Beautiful
