adorable for the price paid almost as much in shipping


Just beautiful, my granddaughter loved it. True to size. She's so happy with it.


The color is great on this dress; however I received it with many discolorations on it. I haven't even washed it yet. I was planning on having her wear it to church and formal events because it's a beautiful dress else wise. Otherwise, the fit was perfect and my daughter loves it.


My 4.5 year old LOVES this dress.  It is lightweight but not at all cheap feeling.  It is a soft cotton material and has managed perfectly after 2 regular loads of laundry.  I got size 6 and it fits my slim 4.5 year old well and with some room to grow.


Just slightly smaller than expected.  My granddaughter  usually wears a 10 but I got her a 12 so she could wear it a little longer.  I hope it still fits after it gets washed. It is a cute dress!


I was so shocked at how perfect all the seams were sewn and it looks perfect on my daughter. It is exactly as pictured and is completely beatiful. Perfect Sunday dress.


Beautiful dress for a present, a little bit large, but in the end it means it will be wearable for even more time


Omg is beautiful ğŸ˜� , my daughter is 6 years old and I get her size 9/10 and was perfect ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


this is a really good dress and the price is great


DO NOT PURCHASE.  THE DRESS IS ADORABLE BUT THE FABRIC IS SO THIN IT SHREDDED THE SECOND TIME MY GRANDDAUGHTER WORE IT TO CHURCH. She was crushed and it was too late to send it back .
