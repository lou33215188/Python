Beautiful dress, but does run a little small. The size 4/5 fits my grand daughter who just started wearing a 4. So she will get some wear out of it but not much, she grows fast


Colors were as vivid as pictures and material was of good quality.


the dress is super cute. well made the fabric is light not too heavy is lined. my niece is on the bigger side so we did buy a few sizes up. she's only 6 years old but got a 11/12 n fits her perfect . we knew to go s few sizes up just because she doesn't fit anything in her age range.


tru to size/good


My daughter loves her new dress.
