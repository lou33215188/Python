Perfect Fit!


Although the dress took a longer time than I thought it would ,my granddaughter  loved her dress.  It fits as expected.


the dress was for my seven daughter and it was a size was 10/12.  I was extremely small, I am sending the dress back.


This dress was cute but had 3 places were the fabric was thin and had wholes in it.


My granddaughter loved this dress. The fit was great


completely sheer and see through.  material is way too thin.


it is pretty dress that fit perfectly to my girl.


looks good but it is smaller than expected


This fit my daughter perfectly i ordered a large 7/8 , no complaints with this would definitely from this buyer again.  she loves it and wears it all the time. The dress is exactly as in the picture and just as bright, it is well made, all hems and stitches were intact with no strings hanging. :)


Very cute and great quality at a reasonable price. I bought 10 and my daughter wears it everyday for school.
