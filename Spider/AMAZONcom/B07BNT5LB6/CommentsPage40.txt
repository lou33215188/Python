It's a beautiful dress and fits perfect. My daughter loves the dress.


top section was running a bit small


Great dress. Would recommend purchasing a tutu of some sort to go underneath as it is not as poofy as shown.


Very pretty, but tight, bought the next size up and still skin tight.  Beautiful dress, however couldn't get it back to send back.  She still wore it.


Of the three dresses that I bought for my grand daughter... this dress put stars in her eyes... whenever she can she puts it on just to wear it.


My granddaughter wears a size 7 so I ordered the 7-8.  We couldn't hardly get it zipped and it was short.  The fabric is also VERY thin.  Pretty, but I probably won't order from there again.


Fits like expected. I got this for my little girls bithday, and she loves it


Quality of the fabric is basically what you pay for. Waist is way too big.


this dress looks so simple but its gorgeous when worn. exactly what a little girl should be wearing for that special occasion!  will become the favorite dress ! fancy dancy for that special outing. nice under slip too!


Beautiful dress .
