It's really pretty but material just seems thin and you can tell it's handmade...but my daughter loves it and that's all that matters!! :)


It is beautiful and it delighted my daughter-in-law and granddaughter!


My daughter loves the dress!

It fits just right and my 7 year old loves it. It came in faster then scheduled.


It's absolutely perfect.  It is well made and looks beautiful.  It came in record time and was packaged well.
