I got this dress for my two nieces. They are two and a half and five (almost six)  and ordered big ones on purpose because I knew they'd be short and I don't like when they wear things that are super short. I ordered a size up for both of them so a size 4 and size 7. They fit well and still have a little room to grow. They LOVE long dresses because they spin in them and pretend they're princesses. :) This dress is gorgeous. My recommendation is washing it separately or with only light colors so that the white doesn't darken.


my 5yo girl loves it.  It is a very nice dress.


Dres is actually gray, not white.


Very well made and beautiful. I ordered a bit larger than usual, as this is 100% cotton. Personally, I will have dress dry-cleaned.


Item was destroyed when we received it. Ordered for a play and not enough time to replace!


I love floral dresses for the spring & summer. Purchased 3 dresses for little nieces. One wore her dress last Sunday. The other 2 are wearing their dress for Easter Sunday service at church. Pretty dresses!


Got this for my granddaughter.  She loves the dress, but it runs small and she's already outgrown it.  Be sure to order a larger size.


It's a cute design, but it's a bit too big and wrinkles super easy--like so easily that wrinkles appear even after I iron it. Plus, it's a hard design to iron.


My daughter absolutely loves this dress, she thinks it is so pretty and she wants to wear it everyday. I however wish it had a little more poof underneath, as it lays a little flat and does not have a lot of body to it. Other then that, it was an absolutely lovely dress. As far as the sizing goes, my daughter is 4 and I got the 4t-5t and she will be able to still wear it next year.


Beautiful dress, the colors are nice and bright.  The dress does run small, I got this for my older girls but it will have to go to young ones, I would definitely go up 2 sizes.
