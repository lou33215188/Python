IT IS GORGEOUS! I had bought another dress also but it came as a weird tent material. was so pretty but weird. THIS was exactly what I expected and the colors are so vibrant. really happy with it. I know my daughter will love it!


These dresses (I purchased 4 for my 5 yr old niece) fit perfectly. She absolutely loves them and gets so many compliments.


I simply compared her measurements to the size chart and BINGO . . .  AWESOME and quick shipping!


Simply adorable on. Fabric is alittle rough though.  But for 5.99 it was a bargain. It will make a cute Easter dress and can still wear it throughout the summer.  Would recommend


Beautiful dress it was a little small around the arm openings. My daughter had noticeable red marks by the end of the day. I bought a 4/5 and she typically wears a 5 and has a smaller frame. For a 5T child, definitely size up.


Very cute dress. Seems to be well made but my granddaughter has a tummy so it's tight and gas to be returned.


This dress is adorable and arrived early!! The bottom is 2 layers and the top 1 layer of cloth. The top layer is a little thin, but still good quality. The only downside is that it is folded small so you will need to fluff it and steam the wrinkles out when you get it if you don't want to wash it first before wearing it. No big deal though. Great dress for the price.


Wrinkles will not iron out!!


Tried steam iron; totally wetting it then ironing; spray starch... nothing would smooth it outğŸ˜�


Will not give to granddaughter....


Very regal


The dress was gorgeous and very well priced. The only negative is that the fitted top of the dress was a little snug. The material is super thin so this is definitely a summer dress. I would recommend getting one size up.


Made of cotton, so it wrinkles easily. We got it for my daughter for her Easter dress and she loved it. It is fully lined, and would make a great warm weather dress. Just have your iron ready.
