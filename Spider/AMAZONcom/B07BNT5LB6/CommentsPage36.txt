Beautiful dress. My granddaughter loves it!


too small


Beautiful

The dress is really beautiful. made well and is very pretty on.


We liked it a lot. I like my girl very well.


The only bad thing is the time it takes to get there.


My 4-yo loves this dress. It is very summery and fits her at a size 4T perfectly. She feels so pretty and looks lovely. So happy to have found these dresses. excellent quality and unmatched style. :)


My granddaughter loves her dress. It is very well made and fits perfectly.  I would recommend.
