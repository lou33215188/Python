The item is of good quality and fits well


Beautiful little dress!  Bought some more as so pretty and well-made!


This dress is beautiful! It is two layers of cotton and just really is nicer then I expected. It does not flare out like the picture but it is very soft cotton. It fit as expected and my little girl (7) loved it.


The material is VERY thin, very difficult to get the wrinkles out, it is like dealing with paper. Putting into dryer a few times on Touch Up did nothing for it. It has pretty coloring, just disappointed in the material.


Nice. Took too long to arrive. But nice clothes for granddaughter


great price and my granddaughter loved it.  I like that it has a sewn in slip.  I gave it four stars cuz I ironed it 4 times and still couldn't get all the wrinkles out and I had to sew the bows down


Nice for every girl


cheap cheap fabric


Bought this for our daughter. She loves it and very nice quality
