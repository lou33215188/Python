very cute dress


My daughter loves it the background color isn't as seen on picture its somewhat brown instead of white as seen seen on picture


This is very beautiful on my daughter and it fits just as expected. She loves it and so do I!


This is beautiful will be buying other dresses.


Don't know how it will look after washing but it is a good buy for the price. The material is very soft and cool. and it is lined and well made


Love this dress also.
