The bows on the front came off very easily and I had to sew them back on (Which is not a problem at all.) Otherwise it fit very nicely!


Great little dress


Sisters received these dresses and the girls and mom love them!


Nice.


my granddaughter's love their dresses and they fit perfectly


A nice dress for the price


This dress fit my growing granddaughter perfectly! She's between 6-6-1/2 but I got a size 7. Perfectly fit her!


This is a great dress, and looked perfect


It's her favorite!


My daughter is a 5/6 I ordered up and fits perfectly. Great quality!!
