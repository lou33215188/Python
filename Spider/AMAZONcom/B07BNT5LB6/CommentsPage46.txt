I love this dress, it is a perfect fit and my Granddaughter loves it!


It's Lovely but not really what i was expected but she still loves it!!!


Gift to little girl.  Looked pretty on the child.


Very thin material. It will be great on very hot days.


Granddaughter loved it and wore it to a very special dinner dance.  Very pretty.


This is a really cute dress, better made than I thought.  Got it for my niece to wear for Church... CUTE LOVE IT


I like the quality and this dress is very nice. I ordered it for my niece and she likes it very much. Size was true to size. Colors are very light and nice.


Very pretty! Great material! Runs somewhat big, but not extremely. I would order size needed.


Very nice. My only issue is that there is no give in the waist seam which is needed when trying to get it on and off.


Beatifull dress for my girl!
