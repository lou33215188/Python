Beautiful dress for my daughter


This dress is nice cotton fabric. It is cute. However, the fit is snug in the top. I returned it because it was too small for my daughter.


It was definitely too small but well made and more beautiful than picture shows.  I would order up a size.


what a lovely dress.  Irons easily, looks great.. Great value for the money


Cute dress, runs a bit small


Granddaughter loves her new dress


The cutest dress.  Perfect fit and size.


Excellent & beautiful dress


cute dress, great deal


Ordered this in two different sizes for my nieces. Their mom says they fit just right and the girls loved them
