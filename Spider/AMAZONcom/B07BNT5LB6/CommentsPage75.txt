muy bueno excelente 100% recomendable.


the dress was a perfect fit. the fabric was not as strong as i would have wanted. it was  a little see through. other than that it was just what i thought it was.


very nice


didn't fall just right. was very cute, though.


Beautiful


What a sweet little girls dress. Children grow so quick for the price and quality well worth it.
