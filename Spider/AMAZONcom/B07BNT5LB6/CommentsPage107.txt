Beautiful dress and extremely affordable


I love this dress as well but was a little too big around waist.


This dress is cute but size was problem. I ordered 9-10 for my 81/2 yrs old daughter. Dress looked so cute and it didn't meet my expectation but nice summer party dress at this price.


My daughter loves the dress.  I am happy with the material, quality and fit.
