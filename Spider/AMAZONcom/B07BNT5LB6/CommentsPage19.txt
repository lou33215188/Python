ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!! SHE LOVED IT!


Bought these as Easter dresses. A different color for each of my girls (4).  They all looked beautiful! They took longer in shipping because I didn't realize they were coming from China. Still not longer than 2 weeks.


Daughter is 6 and she is not real tall on the thin size.I bought a 7-8 and it fits perfect. No wiggle room. If I order again I would go up a size.


The dress is very pretty. She loves it.


lovely dress!!


fit perfect  7-8 size for a normal 7 size


this is the cutes little dress and my grand niece loved it


My granddaughter wore this for Easter and looked so sweet in it. She wore it again the next Sunday because she likes it so much.


Fits great. Beautiful quality for the price.

I believe this dress has a part in her being student of the month
