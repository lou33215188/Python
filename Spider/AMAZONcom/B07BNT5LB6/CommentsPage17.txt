My Granddaughter loved it!


Beautiful Gifts


Lovely!  Great Fabric - crisp, full and simply adorable.  I was surprised at how really nice it was for the price.


Love it


I bought this dress for my ten year old daughter in size 11-12.  When it arrived it looked more beautiful than in the picture. Unfortunately , it was a bit too short.  The dress is so pretty and well made that I do not want to return it.  I will give to my niece who is younger.  I think I may order a bigger size for my daughter.


Nice dress


Just slightly smaller than her other similar dresses but she is also tall for her age.  We love it and are please with it.


Very cute

It's absolutely perfect!!! It's very true to the picture and more. It's being used a summer wedding flower girl dress.
