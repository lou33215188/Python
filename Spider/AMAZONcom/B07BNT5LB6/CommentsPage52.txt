Picked out this dress for my little girl to wear as a costume. Beautiful pattern, and I love that it is all cotton. I gave it four stars because it is a thinner material than I was expecting and a few threads were loose. An easy fix, but not in mint condition.


Wonderful quality and it looks exactly like the picture.  The dress' size is perfect and it's adorable!!


Soft fabric, beautiful dress


Lovely, nice fabric, comfortable dress.


Beautifull dress, it fits somewhat small but it's cute. I recomend you to buy one size bigger than you usually buy for your girl.


Beautiful!  One of my daughters favorite dresses.  It's a very cheerful print and easy care.
