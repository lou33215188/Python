little too small. just hope my daughter will be able to still fit in it this summer


My grand-daughter was delighted!


The dress was ok, material was thin but I guess for the pice you can't expect to get anything of great quality. It serves the purpose of church, I accessories the dress with head wear and stockings and that enhance the dress.


Love it!


My grand daughter just loves it


excellent


Thanks you it fit as expected


Is a very nice Dress


The dresses are beautiful. Thanks


I love it
