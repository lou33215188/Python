Absolutely a beautiful dress! Highly recommend!


This dress is very stylish! It's made of cotton, and fits purfectly. I ordered it the second time. One was for 5 years, fits purfectly to my 4.5 years dauger. I ordered the same dress for the next summer.


beautiful


I bought this for my daughter to wear during summer as the design looked nice and attractive. This dress is overall nice but there is a brownish shade at the bottom which continues to fade upwards (below the waist line). It's not very evident from the pictures on the site and it does make the dress slightly dull.


Good value!!!


Love this, washes well and looks really cute on little girls
