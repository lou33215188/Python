It was a gift


Very pretty dress, my daughter loves it.


Really good . It's beautiful dress .


Needed 6x, wasn't available,  grandaughter very tsll, but still fit fairly well


The dress fit perfectly and is cute. My only issue was that I couldn't add a gift package and card (there were no choices) and I couldn't put anywhere that it was from me so the recipient was confused as to who sent it.


The material is very good quality. I love that it has an inner lining. My granddaughter loved it!


This dress ws okay..


Very Pretty, fit well my granddaughter loved it! Would buy again price was right!


Sooo cute!


These are thin linen dresses, and need a bit of ironing, but they are absolutely Adoreable!
