Beautiful!


The dress is perfect for a growing little girl! Looks adorable, she says it's comfy, and for the price I don't worry about it getting destroyed.


It is an adorable little dress.  So cute and dainty.


Beautiful dress with a slip made in. Top of dress is also lined so no worries of underclothes showing through. I ordered the dress for my daughter and I chose one size larger than her shirt size and the dress fits her perfect.


I bought this for my neice.  I thought the dress was very pretty.  It is perfect for very hot weather, but I made her put a half slip under it.


Cute dress


Great color and style. Fits Granddaughter perfectly. She loves the dress.
