My girl says: "Amazing" she loves this dress .


Very nice little dress. I will order more.


I bought this for my 10 yr old granddaughter. She loves it.


I have a petite 9 yr old who has to sit infront on all her class pictures but I ordered a size bigger.  But when the product came it was smaller and shorter than I expected.


Beautiful colors and easy to care for a lighth iron looks brand new every time.


Buy one size larger, runs small, color vibrant, well made, soft  lightweight summer material. Love it.


A bit large but very cute.


Bodice is too sma;;.


It was way too small. her little sister wore it.


They fit great!  Bought 3 sizes for my 3 grand daughters and they all fit!
