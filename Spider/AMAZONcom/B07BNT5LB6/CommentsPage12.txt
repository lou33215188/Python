My 4 year old loves this dress. It fits well and looks really nice. Survived many rounds of washing and still holding up well.


great little dress - very well made and looks so nice on.


The dresses are adorable they did run a little small but after reading the reviews I ordered 1 size bigger than I would of without the reviews. My only complaint would be that they do wrinkle when I wash and dry them. So I have to iron them each time. Otherwise I would give them a 5for the cuteness and price.


The dress is very cute. My daughter wore it on Easter and she loved it very much.


Daughter tried it on  fit perfect.  A couple days later she decided to wear it in the school play and the zipper broke when she took it off  she wore it twice for maybe an hour altogether.  Finally got the zipper to seal but one side zipped more than the other so now it's uneven when zipped and there's a whole in the bottom


this dress was great! price was incredible! the fit was perfect! i loved it  and she did too!


Very pretty and fits her perfectly! She loves it!


It's a thinner material but it's held up to several washes now and is still hole-free and doing fine. My daughter loves it and it was a great price!


Could have been a bit larger. My granddaughters loved them!


Is shorter than anticipated but fits nice and still works. Daughter loves the dress and the vibrant colors.
