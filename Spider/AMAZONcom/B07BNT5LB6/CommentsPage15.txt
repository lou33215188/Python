This dress is very pretty in the picture but when I got it it is not very pretty. The flowers are not as defined as they look in the picture


Absolutely adorable! I got a 4/5 and it fits almost perfect on my 3T wearing child. It comes down to her shins. It is lined, but definitely a spring summer dress due to thinness. It looks just like the picture!


Hem length was too small on my 3 year old flower girl but was okay for the most part


my grand daughter loved this dress. The quality is very good and it looks wonderful on her. It took at long time to arrive (2 weeks) so if you are going to need it in a hurry, I would not recommend it. Otherwise, this is a great purchase especially given the low price


Item did not look as did in the photo. The bottom half is a muddy brown stained thread color. Daughter did not wear on easter as planned. True to size so I'll give it that for coming from China. Thank you amazon for getting it to us in a timely manner


Very cute and she loves it!


I would say that it is a nice dress for the price I paid. The cor is fast and it did not fade after first wash, I did not washed it again yet. I bought a size 4/5 and my daughter is 5 years old. She has an average height and weight.


Stunningly beautiful and very well made. the purple is vivid. Great buy for the money.


Granddaughter loves it


The dress is very cute and has bright colors. A little tight around waist.  Most 7/8 size pants/ dresses fit perfectly but this dress was a little snug, but believe next size would be to long and baggy. She loved dress and was a princess wearing it for Easter.
