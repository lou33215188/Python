beautiful  dresses for summer , fit perfectly to my daughter


This is not good, I wanted a big sizes 13.14 for my daughter , she really likes itğŸ˜–


Very pretty, but too small.


This is a lovely dress. The cotton is soft and it is well made. It is lined, so it is not sheer.  I received the dress in under 2 weeks, which was 19days earlier than the stated delivery date.  It is an excellent dress, especially when I got it for $6.  I plan to buy many more Sunny Fashion dresses.
