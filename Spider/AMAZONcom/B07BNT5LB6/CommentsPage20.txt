But lined and very pretty.


I bought this dress for my daughter, she is 5.5 years old, 54 pounds and 46 inches. I bought size 7-8 and it fits her perfectly (better than I expected!). I love this simple, lightweight, cool looking summer dress. My daughter loves it too, purple is her favorite color. And it is 100% cotton. I would strongly recommend this dress and I list my daughter's figure, hopefully it will help you when you make size decision.


Nice price comes in small and fell apart after one wash so just know what your getting as a one time waster dress it worked fine


My daughter says it's 4 stars, almost 5 but she still enjoys it!


Was given as a gift and the recipients were happy with it.


It so beautiful, me and my granddorther love it. Thank you.


Thank you


BOUGHT AS A BD GIFT FOR MY 10 YR. OLD GRANDDAUGHTER....SHE LOVES IT!!!  SHE SAYS IT MAKES HER FEEL LIKE A LITTLE LADY!!!!  LOLOL  IT IS A PERFECT FIT ON HER!!!Â 


Beautiful dress that is cheaper than US brands.  I believe this is made in China and shipped directly from there.  Expect 1-2 weeks shipping time.  The sizing is odd.  You have to look through their sizing and see how it matches your child's height.


My daughter has yet to grow into this dress.
