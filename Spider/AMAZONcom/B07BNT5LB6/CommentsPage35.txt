This dress was adorable on my daughter for Easter.  She loves the dress and pairs it with a crochet shrug that we bought.


The picture makes the dress look a little stiffer, and higher thread count. I put a petticoat under this for my daughter, and she wore it in a wedding as a flower girl. It washed well, and held together.


good one!


Excellent quality for the price. Didn't think it would be as good as advertised but it exceeded my expectations.


Cute dress


Attractive dress that fit perfectly for the intended size. Has inner lining, good quality fabric and excellent tailoring.


Beautiful  dress, the little girl loved. The price  is  amazing.


Cute dress.  Smaller than expected and material seems somewhat thin.


It fits like a size 8.  Giving it away since it doesn't fit and have no desire for the return hassle


BROUGHT FOR MY NIECE, REALLY CUTE DRESS, BUT BACK WAS LOOSE HAD TO TIE SWAG TIGHTLY, HOPING SHE WILL GROW INTO IT.


NICE LENGHT THOUGH
