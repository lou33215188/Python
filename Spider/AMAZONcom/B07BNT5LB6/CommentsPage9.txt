The dress fit as expected. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, it was extremely thin and see-through. I purchased a slip for my daughter to wear under it. Otherwise, it is adorable and very light for summer wear!


Material was very cheap and see through.  We waited too long to buy a dress for the Daddy Daughter Dance.  If we had more time I would have replaced with with something else.


For the price quality is good - it came from China. She looked adorable in it!!


exelent dress, beautiful , cheerful color and design.


fit perfect, my girl love it.


I love this dress it's so cute, the reason i gave 3 star its because the dress is falling apart. What a waste!


A nice dress, but my daughter will only be able to wear it for a very short time. It is very snug on her. I ordered an 11/12 and she wears a size 10 in girls.


We used these dresses for our flower girls in our wedding, and they were adorable!  The dresses are great quality at an excellent price!  The girls looked very cute and were comfortable. I am very happy with how these worked out!


Beautiful dress. My 6 year old grand daughter wore it for her daddy daughter dance


The design is good but made from a cheap fabric almost like a translucent cloth.


Wonâ€™t recommend this product.


Beautiful! I bought 2 one for my daughter and one for my niece. High quality, fits as I would expect it to.
