Size 9-10 purchased for a normal sized 8 year old. Adorable, well made, but too tight, couldn't zip. Made for a skinny girl of this size. The same size dress purchased for a 7 year old fit her nicely. So, a normal sized 7 year old--buy the 9-10.


I ordered a 9-10, and my little girl is a size 8.  The dress fit her with just a little room for growth.  Basically, it will be good for church this summer, but won't fit past then.  I paid $6 for the dress and the quality is what you would expect.  It most certainly looks nicer than the quality is, if that makes sense.  Totally worth what I paid and she looks adorable.  The fabric is nice and light for summer and doesn't have anything scratchy that my daughter would freak out about.


I wish I could give 5 stars but the dresses arrived way later then they were supposed to. I did order the dresses a size up bassed on other reviews and really didn't need to the dresses are true to size and they are very very pretty dresses Especially for the price! They are decently made no random threads or ill alignments of the fabric. They are very light weight dresses perfect for church in the summer or a special occasion. I'm giving 4 stars only because they arrived so late if they had been on time I would have given 5 stars the seller did refund me for the shipping fee which I do appreciate But it doesn't make up for the fact that my girls weren't able to use theither dresses for the intended purpose and I also had to go the day before the event and buy dresses that weren't really what I wanted. By the way the lighting in my picture is horrible the dress is a much brighter color then it shows.


This dress is so pretty and it looks expensive. When it arrived I was pleased and impressed by how lovely and vibrant the colors looked and the lining really enhances the dress material. I bought this dress as a gift for a very special little girl and it fit perfect  just like it was made for her. The decorative little bows added an extra touch of beauty and enrichment. Everyone who saw the dress admired how pretty and lovely the dress looked and how well it was made. Little kids know when they look nice and this little diva was all smiles.


Gorgeous dress and nice material. Fit my 5 year old perfectly and she looked so pretty for Easter!


Order a size up otherwise it won't fit


Made small biut other then that its beautiful


My daughter loves this dress (green is her favorite color) and it would be beautiful BUT the bottom fades to this grey/brown color that just looks dirty. Not sure why it's not just white. It was inexpensive and the quality is fine but I would not have bought it knowing how pronounced the brown is.


9 year old granddaughter loved fit perfectly she looks beautiful!! I bought a size 8 or 10 on this one. She loves it she says she feels like a  Princess ğŸ‘¸ğŸ�½


The only issue I have with this dress is that it does not iron well at all.  I have ironed it twice and it still looks wrinkled.  Other than that, my niece loves this dress and looks very pretty in it.  It is a very well made dress and the colors are just so vibrant.  the work on the butterflies is beautiful and definitely make the dress.  I would buy another one of a different color, but I won't due to the way it irons.  I don't like that she looks like she just went rolling around in the grass and wrinkled herself.


I bought this dress in a larger size because I know it would tend to shrink and my daughter likes her dresses to be a little longer than knee length. So it worked out perfectly. It's a very pretty dress for the size. The bottom part of the dress does have a cream color to it which is hard to see in the picture but the dress was still cute. My daughter loves is. If you buy it, get the next size up.
