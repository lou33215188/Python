Very pretty but small. If you have big boobs or arms just move on. This is not the dress for you. Also I feel like I need to wear a slip under it because all of the button actually open and stop short


great quality and good price


I get SO many compliments on this dress. It's so comfortable and cute. The slit adds a nice touch. I would highly recommend this dress!


This dress is awesome. So comfy and flowy but you don't swim lose your figure like some flowy dresses .... and pockets !?!? Whattttt. The pockets are the best part. They don't stick out any awkward way. Got 3 more colors after I tried it on.


This didn't fit me right, but it was so pretty! I ultimately returned it.


Can't close at my boobs without it gaping.


Won't fit over my slightly muscular arms... no give whatsoever. The rest of it looks like it would have been wonderful if it all fit proportionally.


This dress is just perfect!!!


I like it but it runs small and the arms are narrow.


I really wanted to live this dress but the sleeves are too tight! I could take my blood pressure. I even thought about altering the sleeves but it's not worth it. The arms were so tight that I couldn't tell if the rest of the dress fit properly and I don't have really large arms. Unfortunately I will have to return it.


Love this dress!  Every time I wear it I get SO many compliments! My niece and sister loved it so much that they ordered it as well! It's light and flows nicely.
