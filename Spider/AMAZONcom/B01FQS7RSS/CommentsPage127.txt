Super cute and very comfy! I got to wear to my baby shower. I was 30 weeks when I received the dress and it's a tad big but nothing noticeable. It's so light weight and comfortable and the colors are great!


The dress look cheap. Didn’t fit well. Had elastic waist. Very disappointing doesn’t look anything like the picture


This dress is absolutely beautiful. Even with all the great reviews, I was still skeptical. It has hands down gotten the most compliments out of any dress I’ve ever worn—


Oh I wanted this to work so badly. I'm 5ft 7, 34DD, 27 inch waist and 40 hips and ordered a Medium in the navy green. The dress fit like a dream, but was unfortunately about 3 inches too short :( it'll have to go back.


I will say there were some people that complained about the gaping for the buttons in the dress, but I didn't have that issue here. Usually I do -don't get me wrong- ESPECIALLY in the bust, however they did a great job with providing extra fabric on the inside and inner buttons to help keep the top fully clasped. The buttons that show are stretchy so they're relatively easy to button up. The fabric was light and flowy, and the elastic on the waist wasn't too tight or restrictive. Just so very comfortable. If they come up with a Long version of this dress, I'd purchase every color in a heartbeat.


Got allot of great comments while wearing this dress.


I ordered a size up in this dress and it fit perfectly. I get so many compliments on this dress!


FIT IS VERY COMFORTABLE


Like this dress but I'm not crazy about the tassels. Nice to wear on a hot summers day.
