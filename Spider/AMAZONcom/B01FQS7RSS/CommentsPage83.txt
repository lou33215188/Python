I ordered the XL in black.  It's a pretty dress; just too thin and flimsy for me.  I returned it.


Exactly as pictured. Buttons go from top to bottom so you can adjust.


Normally a small in everything so I ordered a small. Wish I would have gotten and XS! Was a little big around the waist section part


This was my first time buying clothes online. I purchased the large sized beige and yellow color. I'm 5'3" and around 150 lbs. The dress is beautiful...true to the color and size.  I would recommend this to anyone.


Buy it! LOVE this cut! Such a flattering dress.


This dress looked as pictured yet it was way to small in my chest area. Its a bit thin which for summer isnt a big issue but also the button and button holes look a tad cheap. I think for a hot summer and a rather smaller chested girl this is a good buy for the money.


Gorgeous flowy dress with centered slit knee high. Fits great I got a large and am 5'7 with 38d chest. Just lovely!


Ordered a size smaller than my usual,  and Im glad I did!  LOVE THIS DRESS!


Beautiful product but the sleeves are waaay too small.


Fit as expected. I usually go with a large but I went with an XL and i love he way it fits.
