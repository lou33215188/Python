Beautiful, colors are darker than pictured. Hem is unfinished. Did shrink a little in the wash. I got lots of compliments.


Fits well and looks really nice. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

Wonderful!!!! He wears super good and is fluttering. It is not a defect, but the buttons could be dark for a more upscale look. Buy it !!! Worth it.

I get SO many compliments when I wear this. Beware, it's really long! I'm 5'8" and it drags often.
