I LOVE this dress. I bought it for pictures and it’s so great. Buy it.


Super Cute, but runs too big, had to return it.


The dress looks as advertise. The material is a little sheer so you can wear a slip under it.


Love the look. Requires light ironing if you don't hang it while still damp.


Armholes way too small.


Love how light and flowy this dress is! I’ve got a lot of compliments so far on it.


I'm 5'7" and usually wear a small. Fits perfectly. Longer than I expected which was great.


Wonderful dress!! Wore it today and received so many compliments. I love it, so stylish!


Spot on with the sizing. It fits like a glove and is so cute. I got so many compliments on this and it is a great material - not cheaply made.


A little large and long, but it is a great looking dress!!!
