Waistline comes up higher than expected, but beautiful and swingy!


Beautiful dress, turns heads


Fabric is flimsy and I've had to mend some seams after just a couple wearings.


This fit wonderfully and flows beautifully in the wind on a beach.


Beautiful dress!


Great dress


I give it to my sister in law and she likes it so much


I absolutely love this dress. I'm 5' 7", 140 lbs, I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly! I can't wait to wear it all summer long.


I love this dress!  It just fits.  5'3" 125lbs.  I ordered a small.  Very feminine.


I purchased the xxl thinking it was going to run small, well I was right I couldn't even get my arms in it comfortably. I normally would wear a lg and the material was very thin. I think the xxl would fit a medium size person well. Looks like I'll need to find someone to gift this dress to now.


Love, love, love this dress!  I got so many compliments on it.  Fit as expected. I'm 5'6 ordered the medium, great length can wear with flats and it doesn't drag or with heels it would work too!
