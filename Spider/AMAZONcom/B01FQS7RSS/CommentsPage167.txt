I saw a girl at church with this darling dress, and she told me she got it on Amazon. I ordered mine, and it came in two days. Be warned that the first iron job takes a bit of time. However, worth every bit of time, because I got at least 5 compliments at church!!! It is light weight, flattering, cool to wear! The only thing is I do not wear dresses that are low-cut. I had to wear a tank to make it modest. The colors were true to the picture. I bought a small, and I am 5'3" and weigh 125. It is very comfortable! I am very happy with this purchase!


So fresh and elegant


at least 4 to 5 sizes smaller than advertised


I bought mulimia button up split floral flowy party maxi dress and since then I have bought and returned 3 trying to get a different version of the original. Why is it not the same dress??????
