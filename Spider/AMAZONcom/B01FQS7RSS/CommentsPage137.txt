"Perfect fit" guide did not work for this dress- I like the dress, although not fitted as I would prefer around the waist. I am exchanging for a smaller size.


Great product.


Fit just as expected. I probably would've ordered a large, but sized down to a medium based on the other reviews - good choice! I'm slightly concerned that the fabric will contract when washed, but I haven't tried yet.


This is so flattering on me. Absolutely love it.  Only thing is if you are 5 ft 1 like me you are probably going to want to wear heels. Keep that in mind.


fit awkwardly if you're busty


This dress is avaukutely beautiful. It fit great and is so comfortable. The buttons are a beautiful touch to the front. It is beautifully made and I received tons of complements when I wore it. I love it!


The arms and shoulders fit too tightly for some odd reason; I'm not a person with particularly large shoulders, either.


it is beautiful


Poor quality


I absolutely love this dress! I receive so many compliments on it every single time I wear it. I could have definitely gone to size medium. It's a long and flowy and just beautiful. Very very feminine!
