I have never received so many compliments on a dress!!! Love it


Slightly sheer in sunlight.


Listing claims length is 60”. Not even close. More like 40”. This isn’t a maxi dress. It barely comes to the knees.


Perfect!!! Just what I wanted. The fabric is was soft and flows  nicely.


Beautiful dress!! i love it, and felt pretty when i wore it

Very easy on the figure. The slit is kinda of high, but super comfortable and flattering. The wife loves it.
