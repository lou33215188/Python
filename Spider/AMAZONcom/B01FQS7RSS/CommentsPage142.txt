Have no idea why it the dress fits so ill! Horrible cut!


This dress is so cute! I’m almost 5’5 and around 160 pounds and I got the large and it fits perfectly!


Beautiful dress!  I sized up (from L to XL), I hate having stuff too tight on my arms.  It was flowy and gorgeous, just what I wanted for my family photos.


I am short. Kind of long. Will have it hemend. Otherwise great dress wish it was cotton and not rayon. Many complaints


The dress is beautiful and comfortable, and each button has its own hook. High quality!


I love it! So comfortable and pretty.


This dress is beautiful, and the fabric is high quality. I'm on 5ft 1, so the dress is a bit long to wear without heels- but I imagine it would fit perfectly for anyone who is 5'5 or taller.


Love this dress. Perfect for spring


I love this dress!!! It is very figure flattering and very comfortable to wear. I did have to wear a slip under it. I highly recommend this dress for the cheap price!


I am between a lg and xl, got the xl and it was perfect. I do wish that the buttons went further down , split pretty high for me. Luckily it is flowy enough to not be too much of problem. Love the dress
