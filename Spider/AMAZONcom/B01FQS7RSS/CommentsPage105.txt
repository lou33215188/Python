This dress was absolutely perfect, except for the fact that it didn't fit me right. The material was so soft and light and the colors were very vibrant, it just didn't look right on me.


It fits, but where it buttons down the front there is nothing behind. I'm a large, got an XXL


Absolutely love this dress. Great fabric. Wore it several times on our vacation because it was so comfortable.


Beautiful!


Just lovely!


I love this dress.  It fit perfectly and looked great.  I got a lot of compliments on it and look forward to wearing it again.


Nice fabric, and fits as expected.


I ordered a button up 3/4 sleeve white_blue dress... THIS LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE! THERE AREN'T EVEN ANY BUTTONS ! The slit is in the wrong place it's on the side. The only thing right with the dress is the length.


It was nice style & print , but it takes a long time to button the dress !! I returned it.


I love this dress and I plan on getting more in different colors - I find it hard to find dresses I am comfortable in and this dress is perfect
