I love it!!


This dress is absolutely beautiful. It's very flowing and feminine. I get compliments whenever I wear it.


Looks fabulous and fits my large arms, which never happens if there's no stretch in the fabric. A little loose in the waist, but if I sized down I know the sleeves would be too tight. I'm gonna get this dress in more colors!


This dress is so nice and has a wonderful flow to it! You will not be disappointed.


It's pretty and flows well, but the waist gives out (stretchy). Some people like that, but I expected it to be more fitted around the waist and the bust. It reminds me more of a swim cover up than a dress.


This dress is amazing. So comfortable and flattering, I got a ton of compliments on it


This fits well but the fabric wrinkles very easily and I couldn't get the wrinkles out with an iron.


I love this dress but I am disappointed, the arms were not sown properly and there was a rip in the seem at the arm and shoulder. On the plus side it is beautiful fabric and colors are vibrant. I bought the yellow half sleeve dress. It also did not come with a return label in the package.


Lovely dress. A bit short on me but I'm 5ft8


I love this dress, the fabric is so soft and makes you feel fresh all day
