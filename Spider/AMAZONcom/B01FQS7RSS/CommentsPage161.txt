Love the dress it is long and elagant. I'm going to use it for my senior pictures


This dress was perfect!


I love this dress so beautiful but to big runs true to your size I thought it would run small so I had to get the correct size!


Not well made, looks old ladyish. Buttons are obvious and stitching is very visible


Using my husband's profile:


Love the color, fabric and style!


Poor quality


Gorgeous good quality dress


Fabric good, fits perfect. Looks like picture


Beautiful


Love it! Will buy it in more colors!!
