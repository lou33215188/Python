I bought it for my huaband's Hawaii themed birthday party. It's a very pretty dress, although the material is thinner than I expected, but it looked good! Great for this price.


Absolutely love this! It's flowy, flattering and comfortable! I bought one in a different color as well.


Plus it arrived quickly.


Beautiful! I get tons of complements ever time I where it! love love love it


Beautiful dress and very comfortable.


kinda tight around the bust/arms area. other than that, perfect! wore to a 70s theme party and it was a hit.


I love it


A little tight in the arms I'm a 14-16 and I ordered the largest size and it barely fit in the up top.


I love this dress!! So flowy and light. I am 5'6 and it is the same length on me as shown in the picture. The only thing I would say is it is a very thin material.


Very flattering, I am a 36D 140# 5’2” and the medium was slightly large, very pretty style, should have got a small


love this dress, I really never order online. I was get scared but I am so glad that I got this dress.
