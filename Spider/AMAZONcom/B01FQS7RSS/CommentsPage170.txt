love it!


Love this dress the material flowed beautifully


This dress is gorgeous! The fabric is well-made, and it looks lovely on!


Fits good and looks great.


I love the patterns and the dress style overall! However, I ordered an extra large (because large is not available) because the first one I bought in a medium didn't fit my arms and across my shoulders, but it was the perfect length and everything else.... But now this one fits across the shoulders but it is too long and I feel like the bust is too low so I will probably have to wear something under it.


Sleeves are much too tight.


Sizes run small


Love it!


Perfect


Love. I want it in every color!
