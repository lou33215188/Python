Arms to skinny


long, classy, fast delivery, fits perfect!


I'm 5'8, weight 195..I ordered 2X. The dress fit as expected except the arms were a little tight. I love the length of the dress. The tight fit of the arms was my only problem..


A small child would have a hard time wearing this dress due to the sleeves sewn so tiny. When you order an extra large, one size larger than normal, you would expect the dress to fit.


Super cute! Comfy, shipped on time. Great price!


I got an XL, I am a size 10 and it’s beautiful


5’7.5” abs 135lb currently 14wks pregnant. Nice enough dress, just not my style and super thin. Sizing was accurate. I got a medium.


Love that this dress fit exactly as I expected! My only complain is that the buttons are so tricky. Great dress tho for the price would definitely purchase  in multiple colors.


Beautiful colors and fits great!!


I could own this dress in every color. I get compliments every time I wear it!
