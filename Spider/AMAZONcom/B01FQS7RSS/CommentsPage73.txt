Ordered an xl, should have ordered a medium.  It's very pretty. Thousand and one buttons, but they have elastic.  Takes linger to button, but looks nicer


This dress is BEAUTIFUL except it didn't fit me in the arms. The fabric has a tiny bit of stretch but its not meant to be stretchy. Clearly its not their fault I have huge arms but ordering a XXL I think bigger arms should be taken into consideration Lol. If I were smaller it would for sure be a perfect fit.


I’m 5’2” and wear a size 12, the large fit be perfectly. I was so comfortable and confident in this dress!


The bodice (top part of dress) was a bit short.  Dress fit like a glove on top, including the sleeves.  Did not leave room for any shrinkage during washing.  The material was 100% rayon.  Experience has shown that even washing materials made of rayon in cold water and air drying is prone to shrinkage.  I sent it back.  Too bad because the pattern on the fabric is lovely.  Very disappointing.


I loved the print and the length but sleeves were way too tight--if the dress were sleeveless, it would have fit just fine.  I'm sending it back.


This dress is so amazing! It would look great on anyone. I got so many compliments the first night I wore it. I love how flow-y it is when you walk.


So flattering and beautiful print.


Little baggy, and veeerry long for me even in heels (5' 5", will need to be hemmed. Feels nice and will be a good summer dress.


I love this dress! I've received countless compliments while wearing it! The only issue I have had is the slit in the front is a little higher than I expected. The slit starts at the end of the buttons. I have contemplated adding a few extra buttons so the wind doesn't blow the dress open as much, but wearing tights underneath has been fine. Highly recommend!


Love this dress - i get so many complements when i wear it!
