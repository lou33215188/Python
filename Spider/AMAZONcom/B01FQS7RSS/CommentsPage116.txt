Love this dress.I am 5'4 so I did hem it ..Very flirty and femine.


Nice dress.


I got many compliments . Beautiful dress, and comfortable


Ok


Nice great product


Waistline sits higher than shown on picture


it is an amazing dress but a little bit too large, the sleeves were a little long and the top was a little big, however I am on the shorter side.


I ordered a small. I am around 5'3 110 lbs.  I do love everything else about it though! I will re-order in XS!


Have ordered this dress twice, both were almost the same even though they were two difference sizes. Tight in the arms and very loose everywhere else.


So disappointed! Not 3/4 sleeve, more yellow than cream!


I am 5’6ish/5’7 and weigh 160 lbs. I bought a medium and it fits perfectly; I bought the black+yellow. It almost barely touches the ground. I LOVE this dress. I had to stand up on the chair to get a good view of it, lol.
