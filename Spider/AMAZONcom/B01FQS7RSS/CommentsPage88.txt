very pretty but the sleeves and chest were a bit tight.  Runs small.  Color just as pictured.


I love it. It fits well and looks great.


Great dress! I'm 5'6 and this was the perfect length with 2" sandals. The elastic waist sits a little higher than I'd expected, but is still flattering. Four stars bc the bust area is a bit shorter than pictured on model.


It would have been a perfect dress if it didn't come with a missing button and hook.


Just got my dress today. I was worried about the fit since I have a bigger chest so I ordered up a size and it's fits great. I probably could have kept it true to size, but I wanted it to me more flowy then tight. I feel like I could wear it to a wedding or the beach. When buying think in U.S. junior sizes.


This dress fit perfect.  Better than expected. I'm 5'6 and 170 (curvy) and got the large and it was a perfect fit. Can't wait to wear it out.


LOVE THIS DRESS! It's so cute, and comfy. I'm curvy and it's so flattering. I think it would look great on almost all body types.


Love it! Looked gorgeous for this nursing mama at a wedding.


So cute!! I’m 5’ tall 145lbs and the medium fit me perfectly. It barely touches the floor when I’m in flats which for someone short like me is great because I can never get maxi anything with it dragging. Will definitely purchase this in another color!


I got 2X and i needed it for the arm space. I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! I wish i could wear it everyday. the material feels good against my skin, its airy and light and i received so many compliments. It also blows nice in the wind and has a train effect when walking down the steps .. which i LOVE.... its goddess like. I am going to buy it in other colors!
