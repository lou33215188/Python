Absolutely love this dress. Usually wear an xxl in tops and purchased an xxl. Fits great. Wish the arms were just a little bigger, but otherwise, no complaints. Can't wait to wear it!!


LOVE this dress! I got a large- 5'8 165 lbs after having a baby 2 months ago. Easy to BF in and beautiful on. Perfect for breast feeding mamas or non BF ladies.


Great dress looks absolutely beautiful just wish there was an option for one smaller size. I'm 5'2" 115 lbs and got the smallest size. It has a little room still and is awfully long on me. Overall though it's a beautiful flowy dress and I'm obsessed with it.


The XL was small enough to fit my tiny 8 year old daughter.


I get compliments on this dress literally every time I wear it. It's so comfortable, light, and flowy--I did end up buying two more in different colors. I'm kind of addicted.


Love this dress! Beautiful. The fabric is rayon which is perfect for hot summer days


Love this dress.  Colors just as shown.  Beautiful.  I am 5'8" and 160lbs.  Ordered a medium and it fits perfectly.  Will be wearing it to an outdoor wedding in October in Nashville, TN.  Can't wait!  Fast delivery also.


This shrunk 2 sizes when washed and the hems were fraying. So sad because it was cute straight out of the package.


Fabric is nice and soft, and I think I would love it, except I look like a friggen linebacker in a dress.


The dress fit perfectly when you follow the size chart given and it was so comfortable! I ended getting two dresses due to a promotion they had at the time and both fit perfectly.
