Beautiful dress! The only reason it's 4 stars is because it's pretty see-through. I wish there was a built in slip for this light color dress, but I just wear beige undergarments when I wear it. It's still a little see-through even with them though. Also, note that if you have a bigger bust, the stretchy waist part will fit a tad more awkward than on smaller chests. It tends to ride up a little. Other than that is it so comfortable and the perfect cut! I will definitely be buying more! Love how it makes me feel and love all the compliments I get! I do recommend!


I'm 5'6", 155lbs, 28" waist, 36" hips, 32DD bust and got a size SMALL, fits like an absolute charm!


I was anxious to buy a dress online without trying on but I just went with my current normal sizing and it fit perfectly! I could lose a little weight and it would probably fit even better around the bust and waist. The strings actually help the buttons from over stretching in the waist bust area if tied to the back. I got the navy pink dress and love that it has longer sleeves! I've been looking for the perfect longer sleeved maxi dress and so glad I found this, thanks to BuzzFeed!!! I just purchased the navy green one as well! I got lots of compliments at work and it made me feel pretty :) not gonna lie my boobs look pretty good in this too..perfect amount of cleavage showing and you can wear a tank underneath if it's too low cut. I like how it has a slit at the bottom as well. I'm 5'6" and the length of the dress was pretty much perfect...maybe an inch or less from the floor wearing flats. Only cons I could think of was the sleeves stretching out after wearing it once and wrinkling up from bending your arms and all the buttons you have to close every time but I don't care cause I love this dress! ğŸ˜¬


I really love this dress and hope to get another. For me it seems that getting the sleeve that reaches my forearm is the best to get. It looks very elegant. I personally think the short sleeve makes it look a bit casual. You get more elegance with the longer sleeve. So the material is nice, very light weight, in certain lighting it may tend to give a see through appearance but I didn't have any issues. It isn't see though enough to where its inappropriate. I weigh 130-135 pounds and I am 5'5. The dress is perfect length with a decent heel. I'm pretty sure if I wore flats with this it wouldn't drag too much. I wore this to dinner to the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Las Vegas and I got so many compliment on it. I felt like a princess and I felt sexy considering how covered up the dress is. Not the typical dress you see people wearing In Las Vegas but I felt pretty. So the way that I wash this dress is I put it in a garment bag, wash cold and then air dry. I just iron the dress in a decent heat setting if needed. I have not experienced any shrinking. I really love this dress.


I wasn't sure what to expect because I either get a lovely dress or one that should be for a child!!  This one I was afraid of the buttons that had elastic loops that do down the entire length. I am ill and that would take me forever to button if it came unbutton for any reason. I loved where the elastic was placed around the waist in a wide area and the 3/4 sleeves. I bought the large according to that blasted chart! I bought the navy and ivory and it is a nice print. I noticed 2 strands that were ties on the ends bit on the inside of the dress and I pulled them thru to the front but they do nothing except hang there but it really didn't matter because I couldn't get it over my head! I want this to fit,I unbuttoned everyone of those buttons to see it it would go on that way and I couldn't pull it on my arms.  I am hoping they will exchange it for an xl because it was on sale last week and now it isn't in an xl.


5-10 180 lbs, ordered XL, Length is good. This dress would probably fit a size 12-14 woman.  It is a pretty dress and is flattering. There are lots of white buttons down the front & 2 useless "navy blue lengths of string with tassels at the bottom," that i will be removing. Colors of the flowers are white, fuchsia (not peach) & bright yellow. There is no wiggle room in the arms and it is tight across the bust. Entire dress is serged so there is no extra room to let out any of the arm seams.  I plan to sew up the front V neck a little so that i will be more comfortable wearing it. There is plenty of fabric around the waist so i could rip open one of the side seams, cut several inches of fabric from there, resew that seam. I will then use the removed fabric to expand the under sides of the sleeves and no one would be the wiser. .


I love love love this dress (beige yellow). It seems a little much for a regularly worn dress, but it's comfortable, flowy, and gorgeous. I read other reviews about the sizes coming a little larger than expected, which I found to be true for me. Based on the given measurements I would be a large, so I ordered down to a medium. I honestly should have ordered a small; although I think my chest would be a bit large in it.


The waist of the medium hangs off my 31" waist. I'm 5'6" and find the dress a bit long, as I step on the back of it without shoes on.


the only reason I'm not giving this a 5 is because it came pretty wrinkled.  I was hoping the wrinkles would fall out after hanging it up, but it looks like I'm going to have to iron this.  I'm not happy about that because I have an iron deficiency..no really I hate ironing...lol!!!  It is a very beautiful dress though and I really do love the style, fit and color.


I normally wear either a 6 or 8, usually 8 in dresses as I have a larger bust (34DD). I bought the medium yellow button up dress with the long sleeves and it fit perfectly. I'm always worried about the bust area, but there's plenty of room (plus there's stretchy buttons to prevent gapping). The waist is stretchy too, so there's tons of room there. I'm 5' 8" and the length is ankle length so it might be too long for shorter people. The fabric, though it came super wrinkled, is very soft and flowy. The pattern is beautiful. I cut off the tassle cords cause I didn't think it matched and they didn't really do anything.


It is not bad as far as fit. The real issue is the hem - it hung down several inches longer in one area, hanging to the floor, where the other side, front and back all hit above the ankle. If it was more flattering, I may have been tempted to fix the hem but it just isn't worth it.


I love this dress, very flowy and feminine. I am 5'5" 155 pounds, 34D and tried all 3 sizes (thanks to primes free returns). The reviews made me think I needed a large, well the large was like a tent, the medium was ok, still large in the chest, the small fit great. My arms aren't tiny so they are a little tight, but not bad. It is low cut but I switched my normal supportive bra for a bralette and now it looks great. With my original bra it would be too revealing for my friends church wedding. The bralette worked out perfectly though. I bought the black/green and also the white/blue. I am going to keep both, the white will be perfect for my bridal shower.
