Love this dress!!! SO cute


Ordered and returned this dress twice! Both times dress was torn on the back.


Love it. Great for the price.


Dress runs a bit large. Also, sides of the hem are about 4 inches longer than the front.  I'm 5' 3"--way too long, and very difficult to hem. However, it is a beautiful print, and lovely fabric.


love it great dress


Beautiful dress and perfect length for my 5'4" body.


I love the softness of the material. The fit is a little larger than I expected but it still works. This dress makes me feel so feminine.


Beautiful print but material fairly thin.  A bit too small in the bust, but perfect everywhere else.  A nice summer dress.


The dress is gorgeous, it looks very elegant and feminine. Was exactly was I was expecting. The fit perfect, I am 5'7 and 140 pounds I ordered a M. I really recommend this product.


Beautiful, but does run a little small and the hem is a little longer on the sides which is easy to fix.
