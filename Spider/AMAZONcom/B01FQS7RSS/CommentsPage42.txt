I was worried about this dress.  It's so gorgeous in the pictures, but as a 40GG button downs have never been a friend to me.  I finally got it and it fits perfectly aside from a bit of snugness around my upper arms(I have wide shoulders).  I am buying several more now.  It is the perfect first date, spring/summer dress.  I am in love with it!!!!


My absolute favorite dress. It came with a pretty significant-sized hole in it though and I should have replaced it. I just act like I never noticed the hole before every time I wear my gorgeous dress! ğŸ¤« Also handwashing as not to shrink the dress or exaggerate the hole.


This is my 4th of these dresses just in different colors and different sleeves on a couple. I like the way it looks, and it fits as expected. I'm 5'5" and 148 lbs. I have to wear flats, so it's a little long on me. Just a slight heal for others or someone taller and you will be fine.  I think the price for the dress is well worth it. Regarding someone's comments on so many buttons... I just buttoned them all and left a few on top open and slipped over my head. I have a long full body slip I have been wearing underneath. Wore the navy blue one to a wedding last week and received lots of compliments.


The dress seems well made but the arms are VERY tight.  I got an XXL, normally wear a size 18, and it is too tight across the bust (C-cup) and just about cutting off the circulation in my arms. I know if I move them, it's going to tear.  Otherwise, I like the dress and I may keep it as I am working on losing weight anyway.


I am 5'2, weighing about 160lbs, with an hourglass figure. I typically wear small shirts, have a 36D-34DD bust, and wear size 8-10 jeans. I ordered the large 


, and it fits perfectly. Additionally, I feel absolutely beautiful, and so feminine!!


Some other reviews are correct that the bottom of the dress is not even all the way around, but to me that fits the style of the dress. Also, being so short, I will need to have it hemmed an inch or two, wear high heels with the dress, or just make sure to gather up the back when I'm using the stairs.


I will likely purchase at least one more of these dresses, in the same size, just with a different fabric.


I really like this dress and received so many compliments. I got the black/green with 3/4 sleeves. It is well made and fits well. For reference, I am 5'4, 34C cup and got a size L. There is a wide elastic band at waist making it for a very flatering and forgiving fit. It's floor lenght on me and I have worn with high heels and flats. I love when a maxi dress is not too long for flat shoes. Great buy!


My husband loved this dress! I'm 30 years old and I feel like its hard to find clothes to fit my age, I like to be a bit more covered up. This dress was amazing. You feel super sexy with keeping a lot covered up. He cleveage got an A+ from my husband. I'm 5'4" and got an XL, it hit the floor when barefoot. My arms are full, however the sleeves fit perfect. Not too big or small. The rope thing? I could take it or leave it. I may get rid of it as it doesn't ride well in the washing machine. The skirt itself does need to be ironed, however I didn't before I wore it and it  as fine. I'll be ordering another.


Nice dress. I'm 5'7" 135lbs 36D. I ordered a medium. The fabric is very thin however it's dark colored so I think nude undergarments will do fine. Very pretty, drapes nicely. Came very, very wrinkled.


I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DRESS! I am 7 months pregnant, 5'5" and 160lbs. This dress fit great besides a little loose around the waists but a size small would have been too tight around my baby bump. If I was back to normal (non pregnant) size 5'5" and 130lbs I would have gotten a small.


I took maternity photos in this dress and it was just amazing. Highly recommendğŸ‘� I will be buying more in different colors! Perfect dress for any occasion.


I was so in love with the pictures I saw of this dress but was terrified that I would look frumpy in it. I am 5'2" about 160 lbs and am a 38c so I ordered a large to be on the safe side. It fits me almost perfectly and I could not be happier! Probably could have gone for a medium, I have plenty of room in the chest area and it's a bit long but otherwise I LOVE it! The length isn't too much of an issue but you'll have to hold the end of the dress sometimes so it isn't dragging.
