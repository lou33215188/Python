5'6 38dd and wear a 16/18 and ordered and xxl. A little tight on my chest but doable. Same day the little belt tie thing fell off so that sucked. Other than that, I really like this dress.


Love this dress.  It is a little to long for my short legs and will have to take it up, but the rest of the dress fits beautifully.


The buttons on the dress are different than the buttons advertised. Overall it's a lovely ( cheaply made) dress. It's a shame the arms do not fit.


Love this dress! Such pretty colors and soft material.


I thought the slit would come up too far for my comfort, but it's perfect!


I normally wear an XL and the XL fit great.


I'm guessing this dress was made in Asia where an "L" is size "S" in America. It pretty but the size runs a little small. If I didn't have boobs it would fit.


So comfy and soft.  I love it!  I ordered a size bigger than I usually would but it is perfect!


LOVE. This is the perfect flowey floral dress for a festival or just to wear around. I'm short (under 5'5") so this dress hits my ankles in a medium, but I wore it with heels without an issue.


This runs very small!! If you are well endowed on the top, forget it! Also arms are way too small. If you are a plus size youâ€™ll be disappointed.


Order one size up! I love this dress! It's flowy and elegant! I can't wait to wear it out!


Love this dress. So flowy and comfortable. And its long.
