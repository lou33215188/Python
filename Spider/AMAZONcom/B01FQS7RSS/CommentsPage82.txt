Love the dress but if you have a chest AT ALL... I would for sure size up!


I love it I am 163 . 5'7 I order M little bit big but love it


Just got mine in today. It flatters in all the right places and with a nice pair of wedges looks great! I'm usually a large/x-large, went with the extra large based on the measurements stated.  I probably could have gotten away with a large, but I'm extremely pleased with the way this dress fits and looks.  I'll probably by more colors and patterns.  The Blue paisley is marvelous!


Didnâ€™t expect the dress to fit and look nice!  Only complaint is way too many buttons, but itâ€™s very flattering and airy - great for a nice outing and itâ€™s great ventilation.


Picture make it look nicer than really is. Fabric and print a little cheap looking in real life. Returned it.


The dress was Beautiful and the Fabric flowed nicely BUT it was too small. I ordered a XL, I wear a size 16 dress it was too tight I gave it to my daughter who wears a size 10. It fit her perfectly.


Desperately wanted it to fit!! I LOVE the dress and order ed d an xl, normal size,and my arms were so tight, I could barely get the dress on!  But then I barely got it off of me! I cried as I folded it up to send back...I ordered two, but I didn't even  open the second one!!!!


I LOVE this dress, but after wearing it (lightly) once, the back seam between the shoulder blades ripped.  I would buy this dress in every color, but I'm having a hard time paying $30 for something that rips after one wear.


The dress was beautiful but a little too big on me. my measurements are 35-30-39 and the medium was a tad loose so I will be returning it for a smaller size. I'm 5'6 and the length of the medium was perfect. I love the flowy the bottom half is. Overall a very flattering dress.


Fits true to size. A little long on someone who's 5'1" but nothing a little hemming cant do!


Gorgeous dress!
