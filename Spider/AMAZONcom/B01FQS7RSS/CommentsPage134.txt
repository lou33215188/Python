This fit weird. I am a size 14 on top and ordered the largest size but the arms and chest were tight and waist was so high it hit me pretty much on my bust instead of under it. I am not very busty but it looked weird and was not flattering. If you know what dresses looked like in Georgian England you know what I'm talking about. It does nothing for your waistline.


Still I wore it because the bottom was very roomy and flowy. I wore a black cami and leggings under it and it was great for work at a bookstore.


However, I washed it once in cold water, hung it up to dry, and somehow it had shrunk. What?! It no longer fits so I wasted the money.


Order a size up if you can. If you can't, don't bother.


Best dress I own. Feels great on, comfortable and makes me feel girly. Love love love
