I absolutely love this dress! It shipped quickly (even to my apo!!) and fits great. I purchased it for Easter and was complimented on it several times.


Pretty and dramatic. Lots of bad stitching but didn't bother me. Lots of compliments.


I love the fit, length, style, and color.  It is also lightweight and breathable.  My only complaint is the dress arrived very wrinkled, and the fabric doesn't seem super durable, so I am concerned about removing the wrinkles before wearing it.


Beautiful dress, the color is more beautiful in reality than in photography


I wore this to my baby shower and I received a lot of compliments.


the dress is shorter in the front than the back.  i will have to alter it.  i am 5'3".  it is very wrinkled when received but that is the fabric,  it is very soft.


Really cute on but runs a little bit big. I normally wear a size 16 and pant, I bought the XXL and should have gotten the XL. Either way, really pretty dress. I plan to purchase another one and a smaller size


was beautiful! wore for a wedding and got lots of compliments


Beautiful dress. Looks exactly like picture.i ordered a L and it fit perfect and had perfect length. I am 5'2 and 185 lbs and a 36 D. I got MANY compliments and inquiries about where I bought it. I recently ordered another Milumia dress because I was so impressed with this one.


Yo this dress is SO cute. I'm 5'10" and 170lbs and I got a large, but I think a medium would've fit perfectly. It's very soft and breathable, my only complaint is that all the buttons were undone, so I had to spend 20 minutes buttoning the whole thing up lol. Definitely worth your while.
