I love it,  but it's cut a bit lower than I expected. Lots of buttons up the front.


Is beautiful - trying to trim my arms down to wear this is someday! Just can't believe sleeves tight but rest fits perfect!


Buy a size larger than you think you need but I get nothing but compliments on this super comfortable and beautiful dress.


This dress does not look good on - there is a ton of material and it does not hang well at all.  Returned it immediately after purchase.


This is a cute dress, but the numerous small buttons and elastic eyelet closures made it a chore trying to button up the dress. It would be okay if you have that kind of time, but I typically don't so I returned it.


The arms were way to small.  The rest fit nice.  The return process was perfect.


Got tons of compliments on this dress. I got this in navy and pink. I am 5'5 and 127lbs and bought medium size. Fits prefectly, flare is amazing. Although the dress is not see through in this color, but in lighter colors it will be.. Me and my friends will be buying more in different colors for sure.


I purchased 3 different colors, cute dresses but each one had it's own imperfections.  The red/white, the bottom sides were way too long and the shoulders were poofy.  The navy/beige, the bottom of one side was shorter than the other, but I kept it anyways, was really cute.  The black w/flowers, ordered a size smaller and it fit really nice, but one of the strings was completely missing.


This is a nice summer dress. Although I don't always care for the high slit in front, it is an attractive dress and not overly revealing. Comfortable too.


I love the print and style.  It fit well but was poorly made and I had to return it for that reason.  The bottom hem was completely crooked and looked awful.  A shame because I really loved everything else about it.
