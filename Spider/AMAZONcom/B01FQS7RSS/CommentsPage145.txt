The style was great the fabric was appropriate but the hem was so bad that it could not be fixed.


Beautiful dress, fit well, good length, so in love with it that I ordered a second dress in a different color and pattern!!


Omg! I love the colors, material and the fit. I did buy it a size bigger, which I don't regret.


I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! It's one of my favorite dresses.


Super cute but it ripped after one wear.


Love it, perfect fit


I love this dress! I wore it to a summer wedding and it was perfect


Dress is beautiful and good quality.  I normally where a size 10, so I went with a large based on other reviews.  It is too big.  I will be ordering medium as soon it is back in stock.


Love it love it! The material is pretty nice and very comfortable!!!


Flattering beautiful dress!
