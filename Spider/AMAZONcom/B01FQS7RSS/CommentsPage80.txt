I love love love this dress! It’s so flowy and feminine. It is really long though so I’m having it shortened but I love the fit, very flattering. I’m wearing it for Easter Sunday services with a pretty hat.


Really enjoy wearing this dress. Get compliments every time I wear it.


I usually am an 8/10 and got the Medium...fits so good, I got so many compliments when I wore it on Thanksgiving!  The colors are so pretty.


I ordered a small and it fit well, I have a larger bust and the waist band comes up pretty high so it almost meets the bust line which isn't the most flattering since it doesn't define my waist. the dress is very pretty and the material is light but is not see through.


nice dress but huge.. size chart is off... us sz 4-6 is a small and an xsmall would fit...not a large!! had to return.


To small, had to return it.


Love how comfy and flowy it is. I am 5'3" so it will need to be hemmed because I want to wear it with flats but it is perfect when I wear heels. I can go between a small and a medium so I ordered both and ended up going with the small. It's a little snug in the arms but it fits great.


This is a beautiful dress but I had to return it b/c it was too big.  After reading all the reviews I thought it best to buy the XL since I am a 36D but I normally buy Med-large clothing.... When I got the dress it was too big and I was expecting the elastic around the middle to be more stretchy or tighter but it's not tight...like at all! Too bad, such a beautiful looking dress.


I bought two of these and they're absolutely beautiful. No complaints. Wash well on delicate, hang dry.


Very comfortable dress, very pretty but I had to cut off 3 inches as I'm only 5'2... luckily I can sew...
