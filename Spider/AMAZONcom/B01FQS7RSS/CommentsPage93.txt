Ordered XL , says 18... no, more like a 12


Beautiful dress that fits so well.  I'm 5.4' ft and 140 pounds.  I wear a size 8 and am average size chest.  I ordered a medium and am so happy with the dress.  I want to order another one.  Its comfortable and flowy & feminine.


I loved this dress so much, I bought another one in a different color!


Great dress.  Roomy enough to where legging underneath to stay warm.  I received a lot of compliments on this dress.  Very comfortable too.


Absolutely lovely. Feel like a lady on the beach when I tried it.


The dress is beautiful, but it runs WAY small.  Like, way small.  I ordered my normal size and it would hardly go up my arms.  It's a beautiful dress, but I'll be returning.


I love this dress so stinkin’ much. Such a happy Easter dress!  Very flattering and flowy. (Excuse the mess in the background - I’m in the process of moving).


Love the dress...I got 3 in different colors/patterns.  I get so many compliments.  Great summer dress, I highly recommend it.


I adore this dress and have gotten compliments on it every time I've worn it!


Really cute & feminine.  Couldn't beat it for the price.  I'm short (5' 3),  have a belly and decent size bust and I was pleased to find it quite flattering.
