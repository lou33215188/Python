This might be my favorite dress in the closet right now.  I bought for a fall wedding in West Virginia, and thought this would be very appropriate.  The fit is just right!  I'm 5' 7" and about 170 - smaller in the bust.  Was worried the top might be too loose, but not at all.  I wish it shipped pre-buttoned, but that's probably the only downside here.  Definitely recommend.


I wore this dress to my cousin's wedding in a garden and I got nothing but compliments all night long!  It fit a little snug in the chest, and you definitely need a slip underneath. I also wore a tank underneath to cover the girls.  Overall, I am pleased with it!


I don't normally write reviews, but this is one of the prettiest most flattering dresses I've ever purchased. I immediately purchased another one in a different pattern after seeing how nicely the first one I ordered fit. I am tall. 5'1'0' and around 185 lbs and ordered a large. Lengthwise, this dress fit the way it does in the pictures of the model (hitting around my ankles as opposed to sweeping the floor as it does in some other reviewers pictures). I'm fairly flat chested, but I think if I were a little bit larger up top it might have made sense to go up a size.


Overall this dress turned out really cute, especially for such a low price.  It is lightweight, comfortable and flows nicely. The colors (I did the navy one) turned out really pretty too.  My only complaint is that it is a little too short for a maxi-length dress.  I'm only 5'7" and it fell above my ankles, which is an awkward length. I could only wear flats sandals with it.  I will keep it but I wish it was just 2-3 inches longer!


Wore this to a friend's wedding as well as a Mother/Son dance with my 5 year old. Had many compliments. There was even a girl wearing the same dress, as well as another friend who said she just purchased this dress the day before. Definitely a hit! Purchased in black size XL. Was a little see thru so I wore a black tunic tank underneath since we were outside. Love the slit in the front! Wore with peeptoe booties in taupe for the wedding and black booties for the dance. Both looked super cute.


Beautiful dress but the sleeves were WAY too tight on my arms (I ordered the dress with the 3/4 sleeves), I felt like I was going to bust out of them. I usually wear a 10-12 so I ordered a Large, everywhere fit fine, but the sleeves were a disappointment, so I will be returning it.


I gave it four stars because the delivery was on time.  The sizing is really off.  The arms were to tight, I could barely get the dress over my boobs.  I am so disappointed because the quality of the dress was nice and I really liked the button up from slit.


I love this dress!!  The fabric has a nice weight, the print is lovely, and all the small buttons with loop closures add a nice touch.  I plan to wear it to an afternoon wedding and can't wait!  Better than I expected for the very reasonable price.


Such a beautiful dress!! I didn't read any reviews saying that it didn't fit in the arms, so I bought it hoping it wouldn't have any problems. But, I did. It didn't fit my arms, so I'm hoping to go up a size and hoping it will fit. It's so pretty!! And I do see where you have to take the time to button the buttons up all the way the first time you get the dress, which is fine.


After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase the size xs. I'm 5'4" and 110lbs. XS fits me just right. It's a beautiful dress. I feel so pretty wearing it. Very flowy. I'm content. Enough said ğŸ˜Š
