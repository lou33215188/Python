Nice but the arms were too tight for my wife


It was really cute, but I had to return it. Didn't fit me.


I absolutely love this dress! It fits perfectly and the fabric is amazing. It is super comfortable and very unique. I am 5'10, weigh approximately 160 with 36D bra size; the large size is great. It is slightly loose but that makes it look and feel even better. I am probably going to order different patterns... So yeah, buy this.


I wear a 1X.  I ordered XXL  The sleeves are tight so it's hard to put the dress on.  The material is  cheap. I'm returning this.


Fits as expected and looks exactly like pictured. I'm 5'5" and it just barely skims the floor when I stand. I got lots of compliments on the color:)


I'm very petite so I ordered a small. Was a little big but shrank in the dryer and now fits perfectly. Very comfortable and cute. I will be getting a lot of wear out of this in the coming summer months.


The arms a little tight. But the length and fit is awesone.


Material is so soft n lightweight n doesn't shrink after washing. It's a perfect summer dress.


Completely see through.


Didn't fit. Way too small. Did not like the fabric.
