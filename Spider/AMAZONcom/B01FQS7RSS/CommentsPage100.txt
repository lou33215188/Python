I could tell the minute I took this dress out of the package that it was NOT a large. It seriously was an actual “small” in size!


This dress was gorgeous on. Even at 5-6 months pregnant!!!


Great dress, sent link to numerous friends and wedding guests that asked me about it!


I went for a size up and it fits a little loose, but I don't mind. I really like how it looks


absolutely gorgeous!!! i am going to get one in every color! i love this dress so much. it's a beautiful print, fabric and fit.


Nice dress but runs small in size.


This is very pretty and I love it


This dress is SO cute, but does not run true to size. I highly recommend buying a size up. I'm a size 14/16, and i bought an XL thinking that would be adequate (the size chart says an XL = 16/18.) The dress is too tight on my shoulders. Size chart should definitely be revised.


Very pretty dress.  The stitching was loose. It had a hole at the back as a resulteam but i winged it.


WOW! I love this dress. So hard to find something as beautiful as this and great quality. This is my go to dress to feel and look good.
