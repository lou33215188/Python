Not only is this dress wonderfully flowy, but the first time I stepped out the door in it, my neighbor who had yet to say a single word to me in the two years of living next to each other stopped what she was doing to tell me I looked beautiful. 10 out of 10, do recommend. Plus it's comfortable!


It’s perfect, even better then what I expected, good quality, the first time I wore it the seam ripped about two inches in the skirt but a little sewing  and it was back to perfect, I’m buying more in different colors!!


Too small, not true to size.  But absolutely beautifully made and lovely flowing dress.


good looking dress. will buy from this site again


I have very large breasts, 38DDD and a tiny waist 28in. so the top of this dress came up over my chest and looked absolutely ridiculous. Made me look like I was wearing a circus tent.


I receive so many compliments when I wear this dress! I feel so pretty in it! I'll most definitely be purchasing it in other colors.


What can I say gorgeous flowy dress....very sexy and eye catching....at least that's what I've been told!!!!  Buying a couple more for next summer.


For the price it's a nice dress


Wonderful and sexy.


Nice summer dress
