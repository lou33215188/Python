Beautiful and can't wait to wear it!


Length and color were absolutely perfect. I'm 5,9" with a 36 D bust. I ordered the large. The waist was pretty big, but I used the tassels as a belt and tied them behind my back to tighten it up a bit. Ultimately I wish I'd gotten the medium, but I'm still in love with this dress.


So the pattern of this dress is lovely and I've bought three different ones... but each one fits way different even though they are all labeled as the same size ... one will have to be returned. The two that fit are absolutely wonderful though


Better quality than I was expecting. Nice and flowy though the waist could be a bit more fitted- and I'm not terribly thin. I wear with a belt.


Lovely. Fits well and is perfect for attending a summer wedding or garden party


Fits great!  Really cute!


I LOVE this dress! Very pretty and comfortable. I've received so many compliments on it. I'm short (5ft), so I have to wear this with my platform shoes for the bottom not to drag, but thats nothing new to me! I'll probably get it hemmed a couple of inches. I would definitely purchase this dress again.


The material is so soft and this looks amazing on!


Although the fit was fine, this dress arrived missing several of the buttons (not even like they'd fallen off, there just seemed to have been no button there to begin with), so there were many gaps as its secured only by a long row of small buttons. Really, really disappointing.


Love the dress. I'm very happy with the pattern and the stretchiness of the fabric. It comes in quite large, so I have it altered (and hemmed),but that might also be since I am a little confused with the sizes. In Switzerland I usually wear a size 36/M, so I ordered Medium which was too big.
