Way way WAYYYY too small. I got an XL and it fit like a children’s medium. Couldn’t even get it to cover my boobs. Terrible.


Lovely dress, very comfortable and flattering, but fades after a few washes.


Love it. So cute. Had to order a size up because sleeves were tight, but once I did that I love it


Love the dress!  I get so many complements!  Little low cut, but can put a tank under if need to.  Arms were a tad snug and cant button it, but I don't mind the look.


Love this dress! Great on its own with sandals or with a denim jacket & booties!


The dress itself is beautiful and the material is nice and soft. The fit is terrible.  I usually wear a large but ordered a 2x  and couldn't even lower my shoulders while putting it on  for fear of ripping it.


The dress fit great, looked and felt amazing....however I had to return it since the sleeves are super thin. If you're ordering a large due to your body size I hope you somehow still have skinny arms.


Great quality! Very comfy material.


Fits perfectly and the material is super soft, stretchy and comfortable! Looks just like the picture!


I get compliments on the dress from men and women whenever I wear it. It is also incredibly comfortable!
