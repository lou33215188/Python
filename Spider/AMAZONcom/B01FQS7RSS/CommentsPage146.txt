Love the dress. I bought one size up. It's supposed to be billowing so I def recommend buying at least one size up. Gorgeous on


Like it


Had it hemmed and I love it! It was a tad tight in the arms and the bust area but other than that, it was beautiful :)


I love this dress! The buttons are a little crooked, I think because of the elastic waist, but fine otherwise


I got so many compliments on this dress, I love it!!!


Love it and the fabric is really nice.


LOVE IT !!!!!


It was everything I expected and fit perfect. I’m 5’5 and 38C. I ordered a L.


This dress looks great on! I ordered up a size since I'm Pregnant and need room to grow. I'd definitely order this dress in other prints, its so comfortable too!


Wonderful dress. I wore for engagement pictures and got SO many compliments. I ordered a size up based on reviews and it fit great.
