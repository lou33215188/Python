I love this dress, however, I did not realize that the buttons go all the way down. Needless to say, I was a scandalous wedding date.


Great dress, fits a little bigger than expected. You never know with these things, but I'd rather it be loose than tight!


Dress fits great! Fabric is kind of thin but its not see through so I'm happy with it. Buttons are easy to do. (Nursing mama approved)


This dress is a head turner. Perfect summer dress it's flowy and breathable. Great quality and even better price!


Love love love this dress! Just beautiful and made well. If you are a small, order a small, because there's some stretch to it in the waist.


Love this dress. Great fit (I'm 6'1"), flows beautifully and is well-made. Would definitely recommend.


I love this dress! I was concerned about the size and ordered a Large. Its a bit big but not enough to return it. I got so many compliments and it was so comfortable that I am ordering another one in a different color, but as a Medium. I am 5'7" and 154 lbs.


Perfect


I want all of the colors in this dress. So sexy and flattering. Summer needs to hurry up so I can wear this constantly.


A bit tight in the arms (but I have big arms), but so flattering. I've gotten so many compliments on this dress!
