Basically fit as expected except the sleeves were a bit narrow.


Such a comfortable dress! It's the perfect length considering I'm 5'2", it is floor length but doesn't drag. I get compliments on it all the time.


LOVE this dress, everything about it, so comfortable !


My new favorite dress. Light and flowy and really comfortable. Want one in every color now!


Arms do not fit properly AT ALL


The cut was very cute, flattering, and the fabric felt wonderful on my skin. It was missing a couple buttons, and the stitching looked like it would come out with one wash, so I returned it.


The cutest dress, I think, I have ever bought! It’s supee comfortable as well.


Beautiful dress and the fit is awesome.Fabric feels so soft on skin..will definetely order more.


If u are 5’7. It  will be to short.  But it is a beautiful dress


I love this dress!  I got many compliments the first time I wore it too.  The fit was perfect.  I am taller so it didn't drag the ground at all.  Thanks
