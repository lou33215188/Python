Pretty dress. A little heavier than I was expecting, and the chest is a little tight. But cute.


Great dress for the price. I received so many compliments the first day I wore it. It's super flowy and boho.


sleeves and waist area fit way too loose but overall I loved the dress and got a lot of compliments!


Love love love it


I normally wear a medium and that's what I ordered, it fits perfectly! Beautiful dress!


will return


Very happy with this purchase! This dress is flattering and nice and light for spring


I love it! Fits perfect I got allot of comments on it and my sister bought one too.


So pretty! Slightly tight in bust but wears beautifully. Usually 16, got a xxl. Would buy again!


too big but love the dress will reorder in smaller
