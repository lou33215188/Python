Love this dress but its short, wish it was a true maxi and covered feet.


Beautiful dress but its too long. I'm 5.1ft  tall and its way too long for me. Too bad I need to return it. I wish they made petite sizes.


Great dress! Very comfortable and stylish!


Delivery was prompt. Love the dress!!!! I wore it to a rehearsal party and received so many compliments! It is so comfortable and made me feel magical!


Usually a size 4 dress, B cup and a small was too big in the chest which looks a little frumpy. Love the front buttons though, plan to use for nursing
