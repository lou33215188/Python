The sleeves were tiny and could not fit.


So comfortable and great coverage


Nice cute dress, like on the picture.


Too big in the waist, a little too short. I'm 5'9" so I wish it were longer, and I wish the waist cinched, but other than that I have enjoyed the dress.


Fits great. I'm 5'1 and I step on the dress while walking. It's a button down with a million buttons. Cute and flowy


Runs a bit small but stretches out.  Great outfit and I got tons of compliments on this dress.


ADORE this dress. It is so comfortable and I get compliments on it every time I wear it. People can't believe it's from Amazon.


This dress is lovely! It fit well and is very flattering. The neckline is nice too.


Love this - just make sure you dry clean


I love this dress. Fits beautifully and very flattering. The dress is long and drags a tad so probably better for those who are a little taller. I wore heels and it was just right.
