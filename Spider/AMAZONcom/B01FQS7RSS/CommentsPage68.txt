This dress is gorgeous! Seriously it is so amazing I have it in two colors. But it is completelyâ€‹ sheer.


Love! I am 5'5" and 120lbs. The Small fit perfect! I bought the black dress with the red/orange flowers... looks fantastic with strawberry blonde hair.


The print is very pretty (earns 2 stars) and the fabric is ok BUT the sizing is so off that even 2 sizes up was tight fitting and made me look 50 lbs more than I am am... So it went back!


Amazing dress! It is quite long and reaches down to your feet, but it is perfect for beach ambiance.


Like the dress but the arms and bust area are a bit tight. I even ordered a bigger size than normal. The rest of the dress is very flowy...it doesn't seem like the proportions are correct. But other than that, I do like the dress!


Tassles had to be cut off because one was barely hanging on by a thread but overall I really love it!


The dress is beautiful.  The size was not.  I bought it to wear to a wedding.  I'm 5'3 and wear a 14/16.  This fit my 5'11 size 4 niece.  She wore it to the wedding.


It is a beautiful dress, a little baggy on me because the size I ordered was off.  I bought it for a wedding, and decided not to wear it, so I will exchange for a smaller size.


Dress looks exactly like the picture.I and 5.4 and 130 lbs. The fitting was perfect. I wore it during a vacation and received many compliments. I am wearing it right now while I'm writing this review.


This is a most beautiful dress both in colors and style but the arms were too tight for me. I so love it but so disappointed with the sleeves.
