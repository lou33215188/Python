This is my third dress I've purchased! I love them and get complimented on the daily â�¤â�¤


This dress is super cute and super comfy! Fit is pretty spot on. If you re short it will be long I am 5'5" and it fit me perfect. it has little ties in the front that are honestly kinda us less but those aside I really love this dress and have been given tons of compliments on it.


1Very satisfied with purchase


Iâ€™m 5â€™1 and bought a small. Iâ€™m usually worried about length but donâ€™t have to with this dress. Itâ€™s light and comfortable. Looks cute with sandals or heels!


I wore this for my son's wedding and it was just what I was looking for.


Beautiful dress.. but the buttons and the loops they go through stop matching up above the waistline. It's bubbled and awkward by the time it reaches the last few buttons. I'll try and fix it myself, but for what I paid I shouldn't have to.


Iâ€™m 5â€™8 140 curvy and it fits like a dream. Ordering more in the future ğŸ‘„


This dress was beyond what I was expecting. Love it and will order more


Cute but the shoulders made me feel a bit like I belonged in the Amish community


Beautiful flowy dress but arrived a wrinkled mess. No care/fabric tags inside dress, feels like 100% rayon, buyer beware it wrinkles like crazy as all rayon does.
