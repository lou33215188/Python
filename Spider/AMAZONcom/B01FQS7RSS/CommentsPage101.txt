Dress is just as pictured. Super cute. The only thing was this. The string already broke and I got the dress about 10 min ago. Didn't even put it on and it was already ripped


Very pretty dress but doesn't fit as well on a short torso. There are a lot of buttons in the front which can be tedious.


The dress it's very beautiful and fit me well can't wait to order a few more. Thank you


I have 29 weeks of pregnancy and I bought the size of L, and all the same it is quite free on me.


Needs a short slip but I love the fit and comfort.


This dress was delivered to me torn and small in the arms ordered a XL and that is not what was delivered to me or this dress just runs very small


This dress is beautiful and I love the fabric.


They sent me the wrong pattern.  While I liked the fit, the material is very thin.  Nice for a light beach or vacation dress


Love this dress.  Very pretty.  Flows beautifully when you walk.  I got loads of compliments!


Fabric is beautiful, fit is perfect.  Style is flattering.  LOVELY!!!
