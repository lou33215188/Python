it nice dress


Oh noooo! I DID NOT EXPECT THESE DRESSES TO BE THIS DELICIOUS!!!!!! Fits perfect and soooooooo freeing, light and cool to touch, pleasant material, VERY WELL made to fit. I'm curvy and even my white one looks incredible. Thank you ! Def recommend ! Xoxo love


great dress


Fabric is so thin, no way I can wear it in public


did run small.  As, I am busty.


Large fits 12/14- but not for large chested women.


I love this dress so much that I just bought in another color!  My best friend ordered one for herself after seeing me in it and loves it just as much!  Very comfy and flowy!  Runs a little big.. I'm 5'4 , 145 lbs and the small fit me just fine!  Highly recommend :)


Super cute! I love the fit and style. Plan on a slip and nude/ white underwear as it's pretty see-through, even with it being flowy.


It fits very well and it is as beautiful as in the picture.


Love this dress! Went by the size chart and it fit perfectly. So pretty
