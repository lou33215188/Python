beautiful dress, I got a ton of compliments at the wedding I wore it to! a little big mostly because it's very stretchy


Just right


I've never felt more beautiful!! This dress is gorgeous.


Great dress looks wonderful on


could not button top.  too small


Such a great dress!  Very comfortable and flowy.  You can dress it up or dress it down.


So many compliments, as pictured.


Great fit and came in on the date as promised !


The dress is very pretty and well made.  However, it is way to big for me.  I followed the sizing chart too


Easily best dress ever. I'm definitely going to get more in different colors ğŸ’™
