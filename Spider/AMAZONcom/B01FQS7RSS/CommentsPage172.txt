Great dress but too small in shoulders, trying again in larger size...update: ordered the large still too tight in shoulder area. I don't have freedom of movement for my arms and I have a young child so that does t work for me. I'm 5ft 7 135 lbs


I bought the navy one and it was shipped in 2 days with prime and once wore it was so beautiful. So ordered 2 more. But the estimated delivery is on June 20- July 14. So dissapointed with the new order. The dress gets a 5 star. 3 star is for the delivery date of the new order.


I love this dress however the waist on this dress is much higher than my own. So I had to keep pulling it down. This dress is very comfortable and flowy. I received many compliments when I wore this dress.


Buyer beware this runs extremely small. Would highly recommend ordering one possibly two sizes bigger. I ordered my normal size of xxl and it fit about like a large. It was tight on my arms and couldn't button at bust line. So disappointing  this dress is beautiful in person.


My wife thinks the pattern is great, but fabric is very sheer.  Have to wear leggings underneath.  Her overall assessment "You get what you pay for."


Very small...although it was listed as small in size


I've received completely wrong item. The dress in the picture looks pretty. I will receive order.


It's beautiful and the material seems lightweight and comfortable, but it runs very small. I couldn't close it over my chest, and the rest of the dress fits wonderfully.


I was thrilled with how cute the dress was. I wore it once and got lots of compliments. When I washed it (one the hand wash setting on my machine) it broke apart in several spots. Very disappointed in the overall quality of the dress.


I loved the dress but can't understand how these girls fit in it! I ordered XL and couldn't get my arms in the sleeves. Just a no go. Who is making this stuff? Do they know the size of 58 yr old american women? Very disappointing
