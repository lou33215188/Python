fantastic!!!


Loved this dress


Beautiful pattern... flattering fit.


This is a truly beautiful and fun dress to wear. I have a fancy gala for New Year's and this is what I ordered. It's funky and yet elegant enough to fit right in.  I plan on having pockets put in because I usually only buy things with pockets to hold my cell phone, credit card, lipstick, ET seeâ€¦ But this is a good bargain for this price, yet truth be told I was willing to pay much more for a dress for this event and ordered this one on a whim. I love it!


China sized -- to small


Loved it


Great quality. I wear an 8 or 10 and the medium fit perfect. Would buy again!


My niece loved it !  Pretty & comfortable


Really liked its fit and flare!


It's a Beautiful Dress, It's a small X-Large do you have the next size up. Thanks
