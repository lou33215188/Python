Ok, straight out of the package, I was apprehensive about this dress. I actually ordered two: the orange and the navy. When I first tried them on, they were badly wrinkled, came up super short (calf length)  and I assumed I would send them both back. Instead, I decided to leave the tags on and carefully iron them. Once I did that and saw how flattering the fit was and how beautifully the bottom of the dresses flowed, I was in love. ğŸ˜�


The fit of the orange was a little looser, and the sleeves were odd; they had weird little peaks at the top that I couldnâ€™t iron down. It bothered me. My husband even commented on the sleeves, saying â€œfrom the waist down it looks great, but from the waist up you look Amish.â€� I figured the navy would be the same way but the 3/4 sleeves fit much better. And the darker color seemed to look more flattering on my fair skin & blonde hair.


I ordered my true size (a large) and both dresses were slightly loose on me. However, I feel that if I had sized down, they would have been too short. I prefer my long dresses to graze the floor and these hit right at my ankles. Iâ€™m about 5â€™8â€� and 165lbs. Material is thin but not see through. I will most likely return the orange but keep the navy, and probably hand-wash it due to reviews saying these dresses drastically shrink during machine wash.


I was very excited when I received this dress.  It looked great, arrived on time and fit as expected.  However, that's where the positives end.  Once I actually washed the dress so I could wear it... it shrunk significantly and that's when I also noticed the hem is completely uneven.  To top it off the tassel came off completely in the wash. This dress is not of good quality and I do not recommend it especially with the current price tag.


Beautiful dress! I ordered the white floral one with longer sleeves in the main picture. It fits like a dream, is quite comfortable, and is very flattering. I am thinking of wearing it as a wedding dress for my very informal ceremony. The fabric feels good and it is not see through as far as I can tell. I bought Medium and am 5'6' 142lb and wear a 36B/34C bra size. Hope this helps!


Gorgeous dress. Love it!! But be warned, if you have big arms and a big chest then it might be too snug. I can wear a 14/16/18 depending on the style and cut of the clothing. I'm a true hourglass with a small waist, a 38 DD chest, and big hips - and I'm 5'5". I ordered the XXL. The length is fine, covers the feet and I can wear it with heels or flats. Across the chest is fine too. The problems for me are the arms and the waist. The arms are too tight. I can put it on and close it, they just give you that sausage-packed feel, like if you move the wrong way you'll rip a seam in the back. It's uncomfortable. Also, like I said, I have a small waist for a woman my size so it's too loose in that area. There is a string at the waist which I thought would allow you to draw it in tighter, but it's just there for decoration, really.


Overall, I love the dress and will order more. But I will have the arms let out and the waist taken in an inch or two. Oh, and just because I like modesty, I'll close that slit at the front too.


In love, this dress is very pretty and feminine, yet so soft, flowy and comfortable. I ordered a large because of the girls and it fits perfect. I was scared the sleeves would be to tight but they have ample space and I don't feel restricted at all. I'm 5"3 for length association. I would recommended. You can dress it down with sandals and a hat or dress it up with heels and accessories. It was a good buy, you don't find a lot of dresses like this anymore.


This is a great spring/summer dress. I received a lot of compliments and questions on wear I got the dress. It fits as expected, but the tassels aren't needed. Too heavy women need to definitely go a size up. Overall I really like it.


I just received my dress, it is the beige yellow XXL and it is rather large on me. I went by a few factors on why I chose XXL size: My measurements (40DD-35-45,) size chart and what other reviewers had recommended; I am beyond surprised by how large the dress fit.


There is definite confusion on the size chart, the biggest factor being the waist measurement on the XXL; 29.7" for waist without mentioning the waist could stretch to 37 to 38" that piece of info would be great to know. The sleeve's are basic size for dress size 14-16 (in my opinion,) if you have heavy upper arms and normally wear a 1X-2X be cautious of sizing before you buy. Plus sizes are made differently then regular sizes, they have a few inches more in: shoulder, back and arms and regular sizes don't; these are a few things to keep in mind.


The bottom half of the dress is so flowing with material, someone who is pear shaped and is 1X on bottom and regular size on top go for it; my sister weighs over 200 pounds and is pear shaped and she could wear the XXL no problem.


I LOVED these dresses (bought 3) when I wore them the first and second times (before washing). The material is super nice and flowy and the length was perfect. None of my garments had tags with care instructions so I played it "safe" (or so I thought) and washed them on the most delicate cycle my washer will do and hung them inside to dry. Well. All three had their own issues. One shrunk up WAY too much, two had different tears in different places along the seams of the skirt, and all three shrunk in size that none fit my arms or chest area comfortably anymore.


I wish there was care instructions as I would have preferred to know what they suggest  for cleaning. And I wish I had worn them sooner as to possibly return the garments for a refund.


Really like these dresses! I bought several colors. Originally tried size medium since I'm not as slender as I used to be but found that the small was a better fit and the elastic under the boobs is frankly very forgiving and very flattering. I'm 5'3 so in bare feet the hem hits the ground, but any shoes especially with a bit of heel and it's no problem - in fact, it's just right. Since I'm short, if I button all of the buttons then the slit is totally modest, hitting only just above my knee; the photos definitely either depict a tall woman or she's not totally buttoned so don't worry about your modesty unless you're really unusually very tall. Very lightweight fabric, happy with that part since a long heavy dress wouldn't be fun. Love how wide the skirt is at the bottom, great flare! Buttons go all the way but these dresses have some fabric backing to prevent gapping at the buttons - if I get really worried about it then I'll just throw a couple of stitches in there. I cut off the tassels on all of the dresses I got, who needs those things swaying in the wind looking all silly? Lighter patterns may require a slip! I did return one because the dress was too sheer, but the darker ones are fine. Just keep that in mind, or have the right color underwear available so it doesn't show through. The dresses with the longer sleeves (sort of a half sleeve) are a little tight on my flabby upper arms but since the fabric has some stretch it's really ok. The cap sleeves on the short sleeve options have no issue at all in that department.


This dress is soooo beautiful. I bought it in an XXL in the black - green color because I read the reviews that it was too small so I am returning and already bought another one in a size Large. Normally I wear L-XL And I was scared that it would be too small from the reviews I read but after trying the XXL on I feel like these dresses are true to size and you really donâ€™t need to size up at all. I am going to wear mine to a wedding this month once I get the smaller size in and can do an update with pics once I get it.


The dress itself is absolutely beautiful for the price. I am in love with the patterns and the design. Itâ€™s very breezy so itâ€™s nice for summertime even though itâ€™s 3/4 sleeves. The material is like a gauzey type of thing. It is thin and could rip easily if not taken care of properly. It should probably be hand washed and hand dried to elongate itâ€™s life. If you wash it in a machine, I would buy a small laundry bag that is used to washing sensitive items with your other clothes. Sometimes women use these for washing bras or tights. You can find them on amazon for cheap ğŸ˜‰


I love this dress so much Iâ€™m going to buy it in at least 4 or 5 other colors. They have a short sleeve version of this dress too that Iâ€™m going to buy some more of too. If youâ€™re on the fence, you should just get it because you wonâ€™t find a dress this nice for this kind of price.


***update*** so I figured Iâ€™d wash the dress to see if it shrunk because I read reviews that said it would shrink and it did in fact shrink a couple of sizes. Itâ€™s still only a tad bit big but I will just keep it and already ordered a smaller fit so itâ€™s a bit tighter. Going to order more. Really like this dress.
