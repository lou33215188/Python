The sleeves were too tight, but it was a last minute buy for a wedding, so I just cut along the seem to give myself some relief.


I LOVE THIS DRESS! This dress has now become my favorite. I wear about a Medium to Large in clothing so I order a large since I am a 38D. This dress fit just right and I love how the arms are not tight at all, which is what I usually worry about when purchasing dresses with sleeves.


Pretty...a bit tight in the arms


The dress is very forgiving! It really gives a great silhouette! However, as other reviews said, the material is super cheap, and has imperfections in construction ( my was missing 1 tassel, and had tons of loose thread). This is the type of fabric that won't last past 3 washes :-(


Great dress! Flows beautifully. Mine was true to size. Nice material


Love this dress! It was a great choice for my engagement photos. The fabric is light and airy, and fits true to size. I have gotten so many compliments on it and you can't beat the price!


Was way small across chest


Love the fabric. Is very comfortable. But it doesn't fit as I expected


My older hippie Aunt would like this. I thought I would like it but it was just not Free People enough


Fit too small for me, even sizing up based on size chart and other reviews. Otherwise a nice, attractive, breezy maxi dress. I only wish it actually fit!
