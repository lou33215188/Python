This is a beautiful dress. The sleeves are slightly tight. The can be rolled up and buttoned. The loops for the multiple buttons are stretchy, so I may sew them closed. They seem to come open easily.


Beautiful, elegant, flowy dress. Perfect for day time.  I love the soft, comfortable material.


This dress is awesome. I feel so dramatic and beautiful in it. I love how long and flowy it is.


Amazing.  I've never felt more beautiful wearing a dress.


I do like the dress, I just ordered one size bigger than recommended. My mistake. I can still wear it, but I have not done so yet. I need to iron it.


I don't ever want to wear anything else except all the other colors and designs I bought in the same dress!


Totally in love with this dress. Received so many compliments
