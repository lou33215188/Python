I love this dress. Hides my unwanted curves and is so feminine. Recently priced as well.


Love this dress


Very disappointed i washed it and it got ripoff from everywhere,i didnt even put it on so sad and also it got shrink


One of the best purchases I have made on amazon yet! I love this dress so much. So flattering. Always receive complements! DONT HESITATE, just buy!!!


I wear a 12/14 38 DDD, 5'8". After reading many reviews I decided to order the 2XL. Fits great. Nice lightweight fabric. V neck is deep so probably needs a slip to provide some modesty


Great dress for the price. Lightweight materials make it great for hot summer weather.


Gorgeous dress. The buttons do have the tendency to open, but I sowed they and it worked perfectly.


Perfect dress for my daughter's tea party!


I love this dress. And it's the perfect length. Definitely ideal for tall people. I'm 5'10 and fit the medium perfectly. Since I got black I didn't have to worry about it being see threw but if it was any lighter there would be a problem.


is not like what the picture seems. Very thin material and very see through. It is also not true to size. I ordered XL and might as well be a size medium.
