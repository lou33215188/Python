I was sent the wrong colored dress. I tried on the dress to see if I would consider keeping it even if I didn't like the color. The dress was too short (I'm 5'3'') and like everyone said the bust was too short. The fabric wrinkles easily and it is see through.


Love this dress! Flowy and lightweight, and the pattern (black and green) is exactly what I was looking for. Good quality for $30-$35 purchase.


Fit is good overall, the elastic waist makes it easy to find a good fit. Only downside is the length- I'm 5'4" and will need to have it hemmed since it is about 3 inches too long- but i tend to expect that. Excited to wear it this summer!


I love this dress!  It's so pretty.  The material is soft and the size is perfect!


Perfect fit


Overall a great value for the dress. I am glad sized up, because it does run small- definitely in the arms and chest area. Very pretty and flowy. The only thing that really sucked is that the dress came completely unbuttoned, but it was only a slight inconvenience.


Heavy fabric, missing buttons and way too short for me. I am 6' tall.


I had a ton of compliments at work. The only issue I have is the sleeves. I am not a twig and have thick arms so it was a bit snug. It loosened as the day went on but I liked the dress so much I bought 2 more.


I ordered by the size chart and it fits perfect length is as well.. I'm 5'8" 135 pounds and ordered small...I love this dress and will order more


It's a pretty dress, and glad I got an xs. The dress came missing buttons and loose threads. That was disappointing.


I get a ridiculous amount of compliments on this dress, especially considering how much I paid for it. I expected it to completely fall apart after washing, but after washing and hang-drying, I haven't seen any issues.  It is a thin material, but due to the floral pattern, it hides that well.
