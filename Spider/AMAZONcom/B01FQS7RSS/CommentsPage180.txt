Sooo happy! I have had this dress on my wishlist for months and I finally bought it. I spent so much time looking at reviews and pictures to make sure it looked good on all body types. I am a size large with a wider midsection, and it is flattering on me. I am about to order another in a different color, that's how happy I am.


Side note: it is so lightweight and flowey. I feel so elegant walking in it.


I'm just hard to please with dresses. I don't like the elastic arm bands. It is long enough, I'm 5'9", but I'd really need to cinch in my waist extra to button it up. I'll take out the elastic & wear it open with something under it.


In love.  I am 5’5” and the length is perfect. Material is light and I love the color mix.


LOVED THIS DRESS!! Used it for a photo shoot and it was nothing short of magical! The dress flowed beautifully and I found it to be only see through if I wore a bright undergarment (as with any white item of clothing) Highly recommend! I've gotten so many people asking me where I got it because they loved it as much as me!


Loved this dress and got amazing compliments. I wore it for various events, birthday parties, dinner, beach walk etc . I'm definitely going to buy another dress. Its colorful, flowy and fits perfectly but one can go with a size up if they need some room around waist.


Beautiful light weight dress. Super flowy and feminine.


This was sent as a gift to my daughter and she loves it!!


Cheap and cute. No complaints other than don't expect a lot of wears out of it. Defo wont last until next summer but cute though.


Couldn’t even get my arms through the holes. For a 2X, that’s just ridiculous.


I get so many compliments on this dress! Love it. The one thing I don’t love is that the bottom isn’t hemmed, just surged. A person could hem it themselves but who has time for that. Psh. Anyway no one noticed the hem except me anyway
