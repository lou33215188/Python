I want to wear it every day.


Returned dress because bodice was tight.


Love this dress. I'm a 14 ordered an XXL and fits well. The material,pattern and care is wonderfull. I went back and ordered 4 more


Good


Warning : donâ€™t buy


I thought this dress  was really pretty and decided to take a chance on it despite some bad reviews. I am 5'5, 140 lbs, 34 C. I really struggled on whether to buy my usual medium or a large because everyone says it runs small. Medium fit just fine, in fact, a small might  have possibly fit.


My issue is with the quality of the dress. I wasn't expecting perfection for $30, but I'm not sure this dress will hold up to a couple of washing. My very top button loop was already broken, and it's too low cut to leave it undone. Stitching was poor, buttons seem loose and unevenly spaced, and there are a lot of loose threads.  I have some basic sewing skills, and would have been willing to fix it if the cut was more flattering. The dress is really short waisted and looks like more of an empire waist than I expected.


The positives are that the material, while thin (must wear proper undergarments) is soft and pretty.


Fits as expected and is exactly what I had in mind.


I've gotten so many compliments on this dress and it fits perfect!!


The dress is poor quality. It is not worth the full price I paid.


This is perfect! I am in love... I will buy in every color!
