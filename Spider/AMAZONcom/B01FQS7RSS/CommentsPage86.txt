Sizing right, but I think I am too short to wear this style.  Too much dress for me


Kind of thin, but very cute! More casual than i expected but i'm still happy with it.


XXL size does not fit arms and shoulders - WAY TOO TIGHT.


Horrible product. Poor quality and a total waste. Falls apart the moment you unwrap it. Wish I could give it 0 stars


The quality of the fabric seemed cheap and fragile. The print and colors were pretty but I didn't think either the fabric or the workmanship would hold up for more than a few wearings. I had to return it because it was too small, but even if it had been a good fit I would have probably sent it back due to its low quality. :-(


This dress makes me feel like a princess! It's light, flowy and it fits perfectly. I'm ordering more dress bc this one is fly!!!

I think this is the first product review I’ve ever written...but this dress is just so amazing! I absolutely love it. It’s easy to either dress down or up, and it’s super comfy and flattering. I get so many compliments every time I wear it - both from friends/family and complete strangers. Definitely a good purchase for a self confidence booster :)


I'm 21 weeks pregnant and bought this for my baby shower in April. The dress is the perfect length and the skirt is wide enough to cover my belly as I get bigger. I'm 5'7 and (with baby weight) 180 lbs -all belly and chest. I'll update this once I have a proper photo of the dress in its full effect.


Very happy with my purchase. Colorfull and comfortabl.


Love this dress and get amazing compliments when I wear it. Bought it for a beach vacation and it looked great and was super comfortable!
