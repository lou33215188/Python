I ordered two sizes larger and love the way this dress flows, simply gorgeous, oh so feminine, can't wait to wear. I ordered in two colors, will definitely be purchasing more


My dress of the summer, normally wear size 8-10 in US women's. A medium fit perfectly. Lots of compliments might order another.


Wore it on a cruise in Europe....comfy, elegant, yet casual....


I have big breasts and a large stomach. I am 5'11 and 210lbs. There is no way this would fit me. Perhaps for a short large breasted person.


This dress is so beautiful on.  It does fit a little big.  I got a small and felt like the top could have been a little smaller.  But i still love it and would buy it again.  There was a small tear in the seam near the shoulder.  But, we fixed it and it's perfect.


A med was perfect for me. I'm 120 and 5' 1". Love it


Runs large. I ordered a small. I'm usually a small or medium (5'6"/sm C/120-125lbs). My friend is larger than me in frame and breast (5'8"/D/140), the small fits her, but is really baggy on me. I still wear it and get lots of compliments. Order a few sizes down. S-M order XS. M-L order S. L order M.


fits smaller than expected.


Nice cool material and patterns.  I love the way it fits - just beautiful!


LOve this dress! So flowy and beautiful.. thin material so perfect for the summer and a vacation. Got many compliments.
