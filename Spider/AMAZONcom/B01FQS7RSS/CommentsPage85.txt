I was nervous about this dress because of all the reviews talking about the material ripping. On the first day I wore the dress the armpit did rip, however since sewing it up I have had no other issues.


Best dress I've ever ordered!!


Material feels amazing and it's not too long and not too short! Like it goes a little past the ankle so it's. Or awkward or anything!! I'm obsessed. Definitely will be ordering more prints!!


I am a standard size 4 and since many reviews noted that this dress ran small I ordered a medium. It was a little too loose so I took a few evenly spaced tucks around gathered area - perfect. I ordered the beige/ yellow. I've never had so many strangers stop and tell me what a pretty dress I'm wearing. It is also one of the most comfortable dresses I've ever worn. I'm going to get one in another color!


Love the pattern. Love the dress.


But the waistband was up on my boobs which made me look much wider.


Wish I got a larger size.


The dress is really nice. The only thing , it came in the wrong size. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars. Iâ€™ll definitely reorder my size.


There was a default on the collar. But I liked it. Little too heavy fabric for hot summer days


Beautiful dress need to have figure like model to wear..


Absolute beautiful! Lots of compliments!! Feels wonderful on!


Get compliments every time I wear this dress. LOVE it


Pretty colors. But dress looked really cheap in person.
