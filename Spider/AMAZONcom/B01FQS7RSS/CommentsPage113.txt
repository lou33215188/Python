Very pretty, classy looking dress


Loved the fit of this dress I bought for my trip to Mexico! It was light and airy perfect for warmer weather. I’m 5’3” and ordered a M it hit a bit under my ankle so I wasn’t tripping over it.


Was a gift for my mother. She loved it. I went a size up bc I read the reviews. Glad I did.


Very cute but also see through on the chest area. I would def recommend wearing something under the dress.


love this dress!! it fit perfectly on me and was made quite a sensation with my co-workers


This is so fun to wear.


I LOVE this dress! The pattern, material, and slit are adorable. I am 5'6 and 130 pounds and the medium fit perfectly.


Very pretty and full dress. It does run a little big and long.


many compliments!!


beautiful fit
