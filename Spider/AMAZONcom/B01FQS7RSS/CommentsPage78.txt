Beautiful dress well made very comfortable however the size chat doesnâ€™t work. I ordered another one smaller.


This is a flowy, form flattering dress. I'm tall, 5'10 and 146lbs and ordered a medium. It comes to my mid-shins which I like because its obvious it's not supposed to be a floor-touching maxi.


I returned the dress for the reason that the sleeves were too tight for may arm. Otherwise it's a nice summer sundress.


I loved this dress when I first got it. Very flattering- a bit long but was able to hem it. Unfortunately the fabric ripped after wearing only two times. The back seam is completely pulling apart, so it's very thin cheap fabric that doesn't have any strength.


I absolutely LOVE this dress!! I'm going to order more in different colors. So comfortable and lightweight. Perfect for summer and can wear tights or leggings under to wear during colder months.


Love this dress! I first ordered a small, but then exchanged for an extra small that fit much better on my waist :) I've gotten lots of compliments on this dress and it's perfect for the office or a date. The quality is really great and it's good for summer but also for the fall transition!


This is such a pretty dresa. Love the color and flow. I got a lot of compliments for this dress.


Perfectly fit... Would like to order some more,..


This would have been really cure but was just too big. I'm 5'2, 155 lbs and I ordered a large.
