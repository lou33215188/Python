Love the dress. pretty flowing style dress. Can't wait for warmer weather.


I bought this dress to wear for a wedding and was very nervous to purchase one online from a company I have never seen. But I was so happy with the dress and the way it fit.


Love it!  Fits and is long enough!!! ğŸ˜›


Adorable dress except pulls across chest. Only concern is that buttons are so tiny and wouldn't want them to pop.


Very pretty dress. My husband loved it too. Good quality and good price!


Pretty but ran large.  I wear it as a duster.  Get lots of compliments.


This is the best dress! Fits as I expected, beautiful print, and a nice light material.  Buying another immediately!


It is tight around the breasts and the arms - but other than that it is gorgeous!


Too small sent it back


It's beautiful, but does not run true to size, as it is too tight in the bust area.  Very disappointed.....
