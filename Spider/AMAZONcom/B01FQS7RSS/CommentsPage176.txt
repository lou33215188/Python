Loved the fabric and the look of the dress.  Unfortunately, the sleeves were too tight on my arms.


Originally ordered a large and switched to a medium. Normally wear a size 7/8 with a 34DD chest.


I was so excited to get this dress and wear it. After reading the pros and cons I decided to go for it! I loved this dress until I put it on :( the waistline hit right in the middle of my breastplate. Lol.. Beautiful fabric but poor execution!


Somewhat small weird odor


Really long, pretty well worth the cost.


I absolutely loved how the dress fit and how pretty it made me feel. Thank you for making such a great dress!


I haven't had a chance to wear it yet. The dress is adorable but very long.


I have received so many compliments of how beautiful this dress is. From ppl I know to strangers out and about. I highly recommend this dress!


I am returning it.


fits great and very comfortable and pretty.
