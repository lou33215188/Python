I am 5'4:, 160 lbs and  usually wear a size 12.  I got the XXL and the fit is fantastic, but I knocked out a star because this dress will require A LOT of ironing.Lots of small buttons down the front, and it is quite forgiving.


I realllly like this dress. Unfortunately the back seem was already torn both times I ordered it. Otherwise it seemed very comfortable.  Unfortunately, I wasn't looking for an open-back dress.


A friend of mine actually bought this dress first, she had wore it to a wedding and I fell in love! I gave it 3 stars only because the sizing was smaller than expected and the material is A LOT cheaper that it looks. I compared with my friends dress, and although it was bought from the same company - hers is not see through, and the size is perfect on me.  It's a win/lose to be honest, the price and style is lovely but the size and material is a loss.


Beautiful dress, but if you are heavier up top... DO NOT BUY IT.


I bought 3 of these dresses for my daughter who is busty and short wasted. They are perfect for her body type. She loves them and gets complements on them always, she will not ware other dresses time to buy more


Cheap, wrinkled mess.  I returned.  I took a chance based on the good reviews from some customers that said dress is cotton.  Don't make this mistake.  It's 100% Rayon.


Hate Hate Hate!!!  The arms are too skinny for the size ... looks like kids size arms were attached to a moomoo. I could have done better tying curtains around my body ...


I love this style of dress and the pattern. The material is great. My only qualm is that the top part isn't long enough if you have a bigger chest. The elastic doesn't go under.


Arms are really snug, waist line is above my bust line-uncomfortable.  Bought a size larger than I wear, but this is obviously made in China


I love the dress for the way it feels when I put it on but the length and the website description is wrong.
