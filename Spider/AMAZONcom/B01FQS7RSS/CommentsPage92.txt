I have never received more. Implements on a dress than this one. It's comfy, easy to wear, and true to size. The white fabric is a little thin so I wear a slip with it, but that solves any transparency issues. Very pretty silhouette. I get stopped in this and people ask me where I got it all the time. Will be ordering in other colors!


Awful fit. Got an XXL and still was too tight in the arms. I wanted this for a photo shoot, I have wife shoulders and built arms and this was too tight.


Gorgeous dress. Material is thinner than I expected but it works well for summer. Got tons of compliments from everyone around.


The material looks cheap. Its better looking with a jacket on.


Its truely beautiful .. the size is perfect .. flowy and good material ..


I'm 5 foot 10.5 inch tall and currently 215lbs while 37 weeks pregnant.  It is so comfortable and so flattering.  I will be buying an other and wilk still fir comfortably after I give birth.  It's very long so if you're short some hemming will need to be done.


4'11 and 140lbs.bought medium . Very cute very comfortable and NOT at all tight or loose.


Bad sizing


I love everything about this dress but the tassels, which I cut off.


The white button stood out against the print and made it look cheap. The sizing is way off. It was HUGE and unflattering.
