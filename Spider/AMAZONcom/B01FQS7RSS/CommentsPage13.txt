I get so many compliments on this dress and am going to order it in another color.  I'm a size 6 and 5' 6" 130 pounds and a small fits great. I wear a 3 in sandal with the dress and length is perfect. Took me a couple tries to get the hang of buttoning the small buttons but now I've got it down! I wear a Camilsolle under the dress because neckline is too low for my taste.


I am legit amazed that this dress fits me PERFECTLY. It is absolutely gorgeous, and feels very well made! For reference I am a curvy girl, usually wear a 13-14 dress and bra size 38F and I got the XXL. I can't believe it fits so well in the chest while still cinching in at the waist. The sleeves aren't too tight at all and the dress is very very comfortable. I am 5'1" so obviously the dress is a little long but only by a couple inches and hemming will take care of that. This is the first dress I've purchased from Amazon and I am so pleased!! This will be my staple wedding and function dress, and it's perfect for outdoor concerts or date night. The pattern itself is very beautiful floral, not "old lady like" at all but understated and feminine. New fave dress!!!!


This is a great dress for those wishing to dress modestly. Just add a cardigan, trousers and scarf. Easy to walk in because of the slit. Removed one star because when buttoned up you can still see through the gaps in the stomach area, but it's an easy cover up with a cardigan. Also, I'm 5'2 and it's a little too long. However, I would still purchase again because it's comfortable and flowy.


Exactly what I've been looking for. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large b/c while I have a small waist, I'm 5'6" and wear a 34GG. Fit is great...but looks better with a belt. Love the way it flows. I wanna order another color so might try a medium just in case


Love this dress!! It was a little big on me, which is surprising and it was quite wrinkled when it arrived. But I ironed it and pinned the back through the inside. And it was stunning! I used this for my civil ceremony on the dock w my now husband :) the pictures came out amazing. I must say it's a little shorter than I'd prefer so I couldn't wear it w flats, but it looked great with wedges


Love the dress style, fits well and flattering. Wore it today for the first time and when I crossed my legs in the car on my way to an eventt five minutes after putting it on and walking out the door I noticed a tear in the fabric. That was hidden in the folds when standing. Disappointing. Returns are a hassle.


 I love this dress out of the 3 I bought this one was the best quality! I'm 5' 3" and 165 pounds and busty 36D bought xxl after reading reviews. But it was droopy in the chest area shoulder and arms were big and waist was loose too... I love it though beautiful!!


Gonna see if they have it in a smaller size ğŸ¤�ğŸ�» Fingers crossed.


I purchased two of these dresses on the same day.  I purchased this one in XL and the other one just L.  The XL was smaller than the large.  Go figure.  I also purchased this one because it had the 3/4 length sleeves, but it seems that is only in the picture, the sleeves are short, and a little on the tight size.  I purchased this one in light colors, the other in dark, personally I like the dark better.  The material is very light, and flows gracefully.  The cut of the dress is very nice, the elastic loops on the buttons tend to give too much and cause a bit of a gap.  Don't buy this dress too small or the elastic button loops will cause a real problem.


The dress is pretty, the material is comfortable, the sleeves and button loops are the reason for three stars.


This dress is amazing. For a very curvy girl like me the cut is so flattering. I ordered one in the elbow length sleeve and one of the short sleeved ones. Both fit great but I felt the elbow length one looked better on me. I did have to sew the skit up a bit and secure the bust area so the buttons wouldn't gape, but for a sewer like myself this was easy. I also removed the ties. They serve no purpose and make the dress look cheap. But I just cut them off and problem solved!


I've gotten so many compliments on this dress. I even heard the word "goddess" used because of the way the dress floats behind while I walk! :)


I ordered this a little skeptical as I do not normally have great luck online shopping or just regular clothes shopping in stores in general. I hate trying on clothes because I often float between sizes. I'm 5'9" and 220lbs and after reading a bunch of reviews, I decided to go with the XXL just to be on the safe side since My arms are on the bigger side and I'm glad I ended up getting this bigger size even though I'm normally just an XL.


 I did want to just note that this dress is more black than navy. I also wish it was more A-line instead of it's more empire waist, but I still really like it! The dress is beautiful and I can't wait to wear it to my friend's wedding this weekend!
