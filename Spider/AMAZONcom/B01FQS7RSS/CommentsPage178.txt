I love this dress!


Nice color and fit as expected.


Wasn't sized corecctly.


I loved!!!!!


Excellent dress. Lots of compliments on it. I'm 5'6 and 180 pounds -just delivered my baby 3 weeks ago. I can breast feed my babe easily and still look stylish. It's. light fabric which is nice for coming summer weather


This dress was terrible I will never buy anything from this company again  if there was a rating for negative Stars I would give them a hundred


I am seriously in love with this dress!!! I'm 5'9 and curvy and ordered an XL...could probably do a large but am happy with how it fits! I love it!! Length was perfect...with no shoes it hit right at my ankle almost top of my foot...I only wear flats so perfect for me :)


I ordered a 2x because I wanted it to be big and flowing. I couldn't fit my arm into the sleeve. Maybe in North Korea it would be a 2x but not in countries with food.


I'll either return it or never wear it
