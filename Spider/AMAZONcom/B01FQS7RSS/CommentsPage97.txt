Very pretty and good quality for the price, but runs quite small.


I love this dress however it was all bunched up on one side where they didn't sew it correctly and i have to return it and hope for a better one by time I have to go to wedding


This is such a darling, feminine dress.  So many compliments when I wear it.


Baggy, wrinkled and ill fitting. KEew the price was too good to be true.


A bit long for my height, but the fabric is versatile and the fit was good


I'm 5'3" and 100 lbs. Bought the smallest size. It fits well enough but is slightly baggy around the waist. Length is perfect with heels. I'll try to shrink this somewhat in the dryer for a tighter fit.


I’m 5’3 and curvy with a large chest, and the size L was absolutely perfect. The dress doesn’t look cheap and the fabric is so pretty. Very cute for any occasion.


The dress was pretty but it was definitely not a USA XXL.  I would say it's more like a USA L/XL.


I had a similar dress that was double the price which I ordered on Showpo.  When I came across this dress and the good reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  It fit fine but the material was very thin and felt and looked cheap.  The color wasn't flattering on me.  So I ended up returning it.  The returning process was quick and easy.


Amazing dress!!! I wore it to a wedding and got tons of compliments. Good material, very comfortable and breathable. I’d buy it in every color.
