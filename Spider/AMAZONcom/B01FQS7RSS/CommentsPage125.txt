Great fit


This dress is everything I hoped it would be. So lovely and flattering. I am 5'1 and I will have to get it hemmed a bit on the bottom, but I don't mind at all.


Was not what I expected. it wasn't very good quality and there was string hanging all around the waist area. would not recommend


I ordered this dress for my  wife. I ordered medium and it came in large. The picture shows short sleeves, the dress I received was long sleeves.  CHEAP material. This is a complete rip off. Do not do not do not buy from here. Complete waste of money. I returned it the same day I received it.


Wife likes it


I just received the dress and it is absolutely beautiful. The material is breathable it's light very flattering throughout yet still conservative and feminine if you are bigger up top it will flatter without it being to showy.


The dress pattern was gorgeous but the waist was too large and the bust had stretchy hoops that hooked around the buttons which allowed for spacing between the material. Had to return it. I'm 5'5" and 170 lbs with a 38DD bust and ordered an XXL.


Too small in the chest. Returned


I am 5'4" and wear 14- 16 sizes. This little large for me around the chest and atleast couple of inches longer than what I expected.. However I still like it


Beautiful dress. Runs super long. I’m 5’3. Had to have it altered.
