Overall I love this dress, I have it in two colors now. The skirt flows so nicely! If I had ordered a lighter color, though, I would be worried about transparent material.


Pretty dress, too small even in next size up. Not as long as expected, asymmetrical hemline.


Soft, beautiful, elegant and amazing dress


Love this dress! It is so flattering!


Loved this! Got soooo many compliments:) since Miami is hot all year long - a comfy but pretty dress like these are good for all year long. going to buy 3 more in different colors.


Great fit, only problem was one of the buttons doesnt line-up, so causes a small gap. However, the dress is flowey, so it is not very noticeable.


Honestly this is the best purchased i've made in clothing on Amazon. I'm almost 5'10 and this dress is long to the floor. The quality is superb for the price. The only con is, if you're busty or have a belly I would skip this one only because it's petite framed up top. I wore a lace closure to cover my 38D bust line.


It's very long. I'm average 5'6" and even with a small heal it drags.


Beautiful dress and quality - this was a great buy. Fit just as expected.


A cheap comfy  summer dress. Feels a bit like wearing a tablecloth or a curtain. Material  is cool and nice.
