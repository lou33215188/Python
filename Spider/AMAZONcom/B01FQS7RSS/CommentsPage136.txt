Very nice dress true to seize I had so many compliments on Easter Sunday would definitely order again. It did shrink a bit when I washed it but I pull it and  iron before it was complete dry and it did help


I love this dress!!! so summery and light weight! Fit perfectly, I got a medium and I'm 5'2 with a large bust (36DD) the fabric feels great not like cheap fabric. It's jut overall amazing dress definitely will by more.


Minus 1 star for two reasons:


Color: I didn't see any customer images of the yellow. I love a true yellow summer/spring dress. Unfortunately, it's more of a fall yellow (mustard/beige). The shade is muddy.


Waist: If you are tall and a size small, expect the waist to cut into your bust a bit. There are multiple comments on here about the waist not being tight enough. If you look at the image, it's because the waist is an empire waist that is too high for them so it cinches at the lower bust and flares out below the bust. Essentially, it becomes a useless cinch for an empire waist design. I recommend going up a size if you are tall so that it just looks like a baggy fit instead of just baggy in the waist area. Also, if you have wide shoulders, go up a size. I'm 5'9 and small boned. It fit my shoulders, but wouldn't fit a large boned person or someone with wide shoulders. It does eventually stretch out though!


That being said the dress is lovely with a light fabric that accentuates curves and moves in all the right areas. The fabric wrinkles though so you will need to iron.
