Quality of the material is not great but the style, pattern and fit are lovable.. packaging was torn when I received it


Love this dress!


I love this dress it's perfect and at this point my go to summer dress. It's soft and breathable and easy to move in.


Cheap feeling fabric and even though I ordered a small it was too big.


My measurements are 38-27-38. The buttons also take forever to button up the entire dress


Great dress, but the seams started pulling within a single wear.. will need some sewing work..


I love my dress and I get lots of compliments. My daughter even wants one exactly like it.


I literally get compliments on this whenever I wear it out!


pretty narrow in the shoulders and rather cheap feeling, but guess I got what I paid for.


The material is verb thin & see through, I recommend wearing some type of slip dress underneath. It's cute on, just cheaply made.


great dress, I ordered the XL, I am a 14 size, and it fit me perfectly!
