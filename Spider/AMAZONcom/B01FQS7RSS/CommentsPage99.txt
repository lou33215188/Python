It is ok, doesnot look that nice on me, eventhough I am tall enough (5'11" and 159lb).


This dress is wonderful! It’s just perfect!


This is a great dress!  It was flowy and cool, I got so many compliments on it!


Beautiful dress. Looks exactly like the photos, had a very elegant flow when walking, perfect length as a 5’ 6”


My only complaint is that it shrunk in the wash (not even the dryer) so it's a bit small now. Otherwise it was my favorite dress. Wore it for my engagement pics.


I love this dress. It fits perfectly. It is well made  and it's gorgeous!!


It is brighter than in the pic - expect orange! - But, it's Fall so it worked out fine.


Bought it as a birthday gift for my girlfriend who generally dislikes dresses - she loves it and looks beautiful!


Too high waisted, large and down to the ankles! I am returning it.


It was way to long so I had to have it hemmed up.
