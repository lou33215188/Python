This dress is so comfy, probably getting more in other colors. Super flowy skirt with tailored top. Light enough for summer in the south.


It was just a little bigger than I wanted so as soon as I get the smaller size I hope to give this 5 stars, cause it is beautiful!


UPDATE! Got my small and am very happy!


Love it!! Totally comfortable, sassy & sexy!


Bust is slightly too small to fit 34DDD.


Love the design and style. Comfy and flowy cute.


GOT a lot of compliments. Can't wait to wear again


Came out of the bag WET and smelling horrible. Ordered an XL and it fit like a M. You basically have to be flat chested to wear this. Hem line is totally lopsided. Completely sheer. Holes everywhere. Cheapest buttons you could possibly ever use. Literally the biggest waste of money.


Fits nice.  Beautifully flowy, a little see through but pretty


Beautiful dress!


Looks as pictured, though I did cut of the waist cord/ties. They did nothing for the outfit in my opinion.
