I LOVE THIS DRESS!!  It  is exactly as the photos showed it.  I ordered a Small and usually take a size 2 in a good dress. I am 5'2" and weigh 108. With 34D bra.  Since I am on the shorter side this dress is going to have to be hemmed about 4-5 inches. As I want it


ankle length. It actually does not have a true hem. The bottom of the fabric is not turned up at all. The edge is just machine overcast and finished off so that it will not ravel. Which is fine with me as I will need to cut a couple inches off and then put a true 2" hem.  It is actually a lot of dress for a petite woman. The skirt is very full. I think it should fit well at the bustline.... if it is too loose it may look like a nightgown or robe!!  Lol. I hope I can pull it off.


I love this beautiful vintage style dress! Good quality fabric, conforms to the body without hugging tight. Can't wait to pair it up with my brown suede lace up boots! Dress of similar style would easily cost $69-$100.00 in department stores.


Would definitely buy again I am 5'2, 190 pounds, 38D. Very Flowing a lot of room if your bottom heavy. Well soon however just one flaw in each of  the dresses I bought. Falls to my ankles however slightly longer in the back. A lot of stretch in the waste but not the bust area.  I bought a medium and I cannot button on the top but I will wear a nice navy camisole underneath because if I go bigger I think it'll look frumpy.  There is no stretch in the button loops like there is in the other floral dress that I purchased they are made differently so keep that in mind.


This is absolute garbage it doesn't fit at all it looks like a shower curtain it's super loose in the body and super tight in the sleeves. So disappointed. The fabric quality is ok. It would probably look good on someone not curvy


I am between 5â€™6â€� and 5â€™7â€� when I stand up straight, and I weigh less than 110 lbs, with most of my height in my legs. I am also small breasted. My normal is not the norm, so it is really difficult to find clothes that fit well. With dresses like this, I usually have to sacrifice length for fit, if I can find some that fits decently at all.


I first saw these dresses on SheIn (and for a little less) but I was too afraid to order from there with the bad reviews, poor BBB standing, and long shipping. These were available through Prime, so I ordered four of these dresses in XS: orange, beige_yellow, black_green, and pink. A couple of the dresses actually have SheIn tags on the inside. The beige_yellow and black_green have longer sleeves than the other two and seem to fit slightly more loosely.


These dresses have a ton of buttons, which can be annoying, but I got used to it. There is elastic in the midsection, but it barely touches me, not to mention fits around me. The tassels are pointless, and, to me, not very cute, but I do not think they are all that noticeable. I even buttoned them inside of one of the dresses once.


These dresses fit a lit more loosely than I expected, but not so much that they look too big for me (or maybe you should be the judge from the pictures). At times, I felt like they hung limply on me in the pictures, but, at other times, I thought they looked nice. I got tons of â€œnice dress, beautiful dress, pretty dressâ€� compliments when wearing these dresses, but that does not really let me know if others think the dresses actually look good on *me*. The dresses were very comfortable and kept me cool in some very hot and humid weather.


The orange was my favorite. The black_green was my least favorite. I felt like it looked old lady like on me. It was the only one that did not get compliments, too. I would normally wear high heels with these, but in the pictures I was on a vacation where I had to do a lot of walking; hence, the Fit Flops. I do not feel like I lost the length for fit with these. I did see that the hem seemed to not be quite level from one side to the other on the orange dress, but it did not seem too noticeable. All in all, these fit me somewhat better than most similar dresses that I try, and I plan to keep wearing them. I would even get the red if they had it in the XS.


Gorgeous dress, but slightly too large wirh an awkward chest fabric. I'm 5'6", 39"-30"-40", and ordered a size XL. The length was floor length without heels, the fabric was beautiful and lightweight but required a slip (ordered one of the white dresses). While I'm busty and expected the fabric on my chest to lay flat, it was a little too much fabric, while not being long enough for the shocking to hit at my natural waist. I'm considering ordering a smaller size. overall I am pleased.


EDIT: I ended up purchasing a Large and giving the X-large away. The large fit great. After washing (cold water and line-dry), it shrank so that the bust area was too small, and the elastic empire waist went across the fullest part of my bust. I've reduced my rating from 4 stars to 3 for poor fabric quality.


Really surprised at how much I love this dress. For the price, I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. The smallest size was a little big on me (5'4'', 105 lbs), but I belted the waist and it looked great. I got many compliments wearing this dress. The quality isn't great, but it isn't noticeable once you put the dress on.


I'm 5'7" and US size 14.  In bare feet this dress just barely grazes the floor.  I can wear flats with it, but I need to be careful not to step on it.  The v-neck is very low, so I wear a navy tank underneath and it looks fine.  This dress is not very slimming.  I thought it would be slimming because of the empire waist, but it isn't.  If you're thin you will look thin and if you're thick you will look thick....much to my chagrin.  The dress looks as it does in the photo, but there were some issues.  There was an extra button loop with no button at the bottom and two of the loops had been sewn into the seam of the dress and I had to "free" them (cut them loose) from the thread.  It wasn't difficult because I have some sewing skills, but still disappointing.  Overall it's an okay dress for the money, so I'm keeping it.  It's very 90s and I like that.


Love the dress, the buttons have space between them intentionally where skin or bra will show so be aware (loop button closures). There is an elasticized waist which will give quite a bit. I am a size 12 and ordered XXL but should have ordered an XL. Before washing and drying on high it was at least one size too big. After drying it shrunk one size. The sleeves (after wash) are right at my elbow and the length came up to ankle before washing it touched the floor. I am 5'7. If I were ordering again I would order XL and dry for a short time. Still love the dress, glad it shrunk but beware of the dryer if yours fits right out of bag!


Dress shopping is always the worst for me because of my boobs ğŸ˜‘ When I saw the positive reviews for this dress I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! It's perfect for my body shape. I have a large chest, smaller waist and somewhat wide hips. I'm a 34DD and typically wear a size 10 to 12 in dresses. I got the large but it actually was just a little too big so I ordered the medium. The medium fits perfect! I'm 5'4" and this dress falls right below my ankle. Perfect length for my cousins field wedding and also perfect thin material considering it'll be in Alabama lol This dress is made very well, very flattering and I love how flowy it is! Also the pattern and colors are true to photo. I definitely recommend this dress even if you're unsure, give it a try! I posted photos to show the fit and style. Hope this is helpful ğŸ˜Š
