What a cute dress! I've received a lot of compliments on it. Was a bit long when I received it (I'm petite and 5'1") but one wash/dry and it shrunk it a bit. That did the job!


I really loved this dress & ordered it to wear in my enegagment photos. I’m 5’7, 135lbs with a 28 in waist. I ordered a medium & it was too big, no big deal. I decided to order a small, I received it today & it is bigger than the medium?! I will be returning them both.


Love this dress, will most likely purchase from brand again in the future.


My all time favorite dress. It is so perfect and flattering. I want more!!!


Nice dress but it was about 4 inches too long for wearing with flats.


fit perfect until I washed and dried it which made it a bit small, I did not look for specific washing instructions so it might be my mistake but I still LOVE this dress


Arrived with a giant hole in the side.


Is a nice dress but very see through fabric. Just 3⭐️ Because very bad delivery conditions my package came opened


Cute dress.  Fits nicely.


The pattern is beautiful...but the size is off. Runs small. Thinking of turning this into a skirt
