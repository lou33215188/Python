Very beautiful and well made dress.  It was exactly as expected


Love it have received compliments every time I have worn it


This dress flows so beautifully when you walk!  I love this dress so much and never want to take it off!  Fit perfectly, i am 5'3" and weigh 145, got a medium.


I love this dress! It's so pretty in person, fits great.


Lived the first dress I bought. Unfortunately I accidentally shrank it. So, I bought another to replace it. The new one's fabric wad super faded and mhted out. None of the oranges were ad vibrant.  Very sad because I lived the first one I got.


Love love love this dress just as Iâ€™d hoped!


The sleeves are super tight not like this image shows


Quality was great, but definitely not good for chubby people at all. even the largest size does not fit us.


I'm 5'4 and 120# and the small fit beautifully! I love how soft and comfortable it is! I did get the white/ivory and will wear a slip underneath but you could get away with nude underwear.


So soft and flowy, and beautiful colors.
