I LOVED this dress! The fit was just right, I'm usually a size 14 and a C cup and the Large was perfect. It's light weight, elegant yet comfy. I wore this to an outdoor wedding and got so many compliments. I'm 5'7, I would recommend wearing 3+ inch heels because it is very long and even had to carry my dress a little while I danced. Overall beautiful dress, I would buy it again in a different color.


This is a great dress!  I'm 5'8" and it's the perfect length with plenty of fullness in the skirt.  (not too much, I just didn't feel they were trying to save money when they made it by cutting corners)  It fits true to size too. Very pleased with this purchase.


Nice pattern, I liked it, but it was too short to my liking. I'm 5'7" and it was above my ankle.. Had to return it.


Not the best quality, but beatiful, and a little large for me.


I purchase a small, I used it on my 20 week pregnant, I am 5' 5", 36 DD (because of the pregnancy) and 120 pounds and it is (still) a little large in the superior part (bust) for me.


Dress is beautiful well made I bought 4 of them . Fabric is good . I love it


I have a big breast (Size-"G"), because of this the waist line is going up. I have this issue almost with all dresses. I will do some alteration. I still love the dress.


Love it.  I get so many compliments on these dresses.  I have about 5 in different colors.  Thanks for making this dress available.


Item is sewn wrong at sleeve seam. Due to the product being seen incorrectly there is a large flap of extra material at the sleeve making it unwearable.


Beautiful! I got so many compliments on this dress. You will need to iron it though.


Beautiful dress but runs very small.  If you have any weight in your arms forget it.
