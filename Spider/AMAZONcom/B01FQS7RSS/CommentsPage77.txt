This is a beautiful, well-made dress. The buttons stop about upper thigh, so I sewed it down a bit farther. I would purchase another.


This dress is so so cute! It's very soft and the buttons don't separate to show skin like with most button up dresses. It's flowy but not see-through and the pattern is really pretty. I'm 5,2 135lbs and usually wear a small or petite small. I got this in a small and it fits great--its not even  too long! I will probably be buying more patterns!


Fits amazing! Usually a size 8/medium and ordered the medium and it's perfect. Nice & lightweight material and flattering fit.


I love this dress and it looks great. Not exactly as pictures and fairly thin material but received a lot of compliments and comfortable.


My new favorite dress! It's so pretty and flowy. One of the tassels fell off the first day I wore it, but I really didn't care about them in the first place. I also ended up taking in the waist just a smidge, but now it fits perfectly. I'm always looking for a reason to wear this out. (:


Nice dress! Some fit issues but a belt helped! I'm 5'4" and the length was good. Wore for newborn family pictures.


Thin fabric, but okay overall. Definitely need to wear a slip or something under it.


A little too big but I made a piece of blue fabric to fill in the gap up top.


Really great dress. Fit exactly as expected. I’m 5’1 so the dress for me fits as a perfect long flowy dress. It’s not to long that I’m forced to wear heels so that’s a big plus for me. Every time I wear it I get a bunch of compliments and people are shocked I ordered it from amazon! It does shrink so I would suggest air drying.


I love this dress! I received so many compliments on it. The only issue was that the white material was slightly see through, so I needed to wear a slip underneath.  Still very comfortable. I'm 5'6", 133 lbs, and a small fit well.
