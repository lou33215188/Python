I love this dress! I have big boobs, smaller waist and wide hips, so I generally prefer empire waist dresses, which are hard to find. This dress is beautiful and flowy, and the front buttons allows me to wear it like a dress or undo some more buttons and add shorts or tights underneath for a different look. I have gotten so many compliments on it, and people cannot believe I got it off Amazon! I love it so much, I bought another color- will update my review once I receive it. So far, shipping was perfectly on time for the first dress.


I love this dress! I bought it in the blue green color first and I loved it so much I bought the beige as well! Its very flowy and light which makes it comfortable to wear even in the Florida summer heat! I'm 5'7 and the length is perfect! I'm a size 12 and normally wear a large but I ordered this dress in an extra large since people said it runs small and it fits pretty perfectly. I'm a size 36 C and the buttons struggle slightly in that area but they fasten to an elastic loop so it helps and it's not enough to have to wear something underneath. I also noticed that as you wear it the material seems to slightly stretch out, it doesn't look baggy but just fits a little looser in my arms and bust area. I have bigger arms and usually have issues with sleeves that aren't stretchy fabric, but I was pleasantly suprised this fits in the arms comfortably! Hope this helps!


Relevant info: I'm 5'3, I weigh about 140, I take a 34C and clothes that are sized small are often uncomfortable across my upper back. I took a Large.


Ok, to start, this is a $30 dress. If you're expecting Givenchy quality you will be disappointed. But for a $30 dress, this is a VERY nice dress!


The sizing varies by the print so definitely read as many reviews as you can. I bought the Black and the Black-Green and I had to return the Black-Green because it was way too long. The Black is perfect to *maybe* a half inch too long when barefoot, but I'm not tripping at all so I'm not worried about it.


The buttons do not go all the way down as I thought they did, but I actually love where it opens (about knee level on me) and it looks fully closed when I'm standing instead of walking.


There were a few loose threads which I cut and do not care about.


It's not too low cut, which I was afraid of. I'm not very busty, as mentioned above. My favorite thing is the piece of fabric (placket?) under the buttons which prevents that dreaded gap and peekaboo of skin. That alone is worth the 5 stars. It's also not see-through, HOORAY, and not too tight on my arms.


Overall a fantastic purchase and I'm on the lookout for another!


This dress it pretty and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it. However, it's see through, lowcut, and the buttons end so high up that you can see my underwear on the front. Also, the tie in the center was ripped, several of the seems were not finished, and there was a lot of strings to cut. I wear of with a undershirt and skirt slip. I also sewed a few areas to make it work. I think this is way too much work.


OK, love this dress!  Yes, the soft rayon fabric drapes gorgeously.  I sized up as instructed. (Normally choose a medium, but noticed it stated the thin model was wearing a large!!!!  So I ordered large also, as I am 5/5 and about 130 pounds, hourglass figure.)  The fit is obviously a little less loose on me than the model, which is perfect.  The waist on the navy/taupe dress is lower than on the others (at least by the photos) and mine is exactly as pictured, sitting at my waistline, not above it.  Perfect!


Cons?


1.The buttons aren't spaced perfectly, but so small I can't even tell without them 2 inches from my nose. Not a problem.  And they come all the way down to the top of my knee, meaning I can wear a knee length black slip and black cami with this and it looks WOW.  Very expensive, boho look, IMHO.


2.  This is exceedingly LONG.  I got out my highest (five inch) platform sandals and it still drags on the floor.  I'm having it altered, which is not something for the amateur.  Why?  The hemline is almost circular and beautifully irregular on this particular dress (some not - check the photos to see what I mean, esp. the short sleeved ones).  It requires about 5 inches off, and even then it will be ankle length on me!  I have a great person to alter it, but I recommend one with a straight (not circular) hem if you must do it yourself.


Not sure yet if my adorable dress will shrink slightly?  To be on the safe side, I'm thinking I may wash this hand wash this in cold water before having it altered, just to be on the safe side.  No agitation, no dryer, drip dry.


Had looked at this dress and the reviews for weeks before buying. I'm sorry I waited so long to order it.  It arrived last night & I LOVE this dress.  The material is so soft and flows beautifully.  The pattern is gorgeous.  I am 5'9" and wear a large usually but ordered a XL here.  I think a large would have been fine and have ordered another different pattern in a large so I'll know soon.  Because I am tall, I usually can wear dresses longer, mid calf, but this was a little longer than I like. I cut off about 3 inches and hemmed it. Now it's more of a length I like and I'm very happy.  The longer length is okay, but I really wanted about mid-calf, not down to my ankles. I wore this out today and received a compliment from one of the first people I ran into.  It's a lovely dress.  Well worth the price.


I loved this dress! I wore it to my brother's wedding and I was complimented on my outfit all day/all night long. I bought a medium and I usually wear a large (sometimes M) and it fit perfectly. It actually got more comfortable as the day went on. I have a small chest so the waist band and the buttons weren't a problem, but it was almost a little too tight around that area. (Just FYI to any one with a bigger chest!) It was a little bit see through but I wore black casual shorts under. I didn't really mind at all. I'm definitely going to be wearing this again!


Pros - Medium fit as expected, however the bustline is snug for a C, I am hoping it does not shrink once washed -- pattern is as in the picture for the black/peach - Very comfortable, flowy material


Cons - the Stitching lacks quality control....at the shoulder seam, the bobbin caught a section of the material from the chest panel and it was gathered up and sewn into the shoulder seam. There is No way you could wear it like that.  I had to cut a 2 inch section of the seam out (luckily did not damage the Thin material) release the gathered material from the chest panel and resewed the seam. I also found a circular hole in the front toward the  knee area, it seemed  like it was stamped out with something perfectly round approximately 1/4 inch. You really cannot see it, however it is quite possible during a wash it could easily get bigger because the material is So Thin. I may try a stitch in it to reinforce but also don't want it to ruin how it hangs.


Overall - this is the 2nd dress I purchased, the yellow dress 1st - no stitching problems with that dress, the only thing is also the bust-line is definitely snug for a C - its wearable and i like the style - i just wish it had a tiny bit more room between the shoulder and the elastic band which hits directly on the bottom of bra-line.


I am 5'3 and curvy so I wasn't sure that this would fit, but it is so comfortable. It covers me and I feel wonderful in it.  I wish the buttons were reinforced but overall, I love this dress. Its soft, and flowy. Exactly what I pictured a "Bohemian" type dress would be. **Be mindful! Don't put it in the dryer- mine shrank about 3 inches in length**


So bummed it didn't work out! I am curvy and was hoping it would but no... Felt like a maternity dress. I think you need to be tall and lean (how the model in the picture looks) for it to look good... My sister said I looked like a pregnant Snape with a cape flowing behind me but my boobs looked National Geographic, extremely tight (34D). Well made and good material though, but heads up... ğŸ™„
