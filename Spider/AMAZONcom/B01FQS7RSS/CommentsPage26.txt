Bought this dress for my engagement shoot. It was beautiful! Not the most well made dress so the longevity would not be long but the price is right for the quality. I wear L-XL shirt normally ordered XXL and it fit just right. Plenty of fabric and room in the hips. Iâ€™m 6â€™ so the dress was more of an ankle dress for me did not touch the ground.


I bought this to wear to a wedding in Montana. And while I briefly tried it on when it came in the mail I didn't notice the small hole till I was placing it in my suitcase. I wore it anyway b/c I had nothing else and no time. While I did get plenty of compliments, it came with a hole and is made of pretty cheap quality, expected for the price.


Purchased an XXL based on measurements. Received it and couldnâ€™t even get my arm in the sleeves. When wrapping around my waist, the measurements were horribly off. My petite framed mother who is a size eight to ten fit this perfectly.


Super cute dress. Very flattering. I debated getting the Medium or Large. I ultimately went with the large based on other reviews and the sizing chart. I wish I would have trusted myself and went with the medium. You won't be disappointed in this dress. It's casual and fun to wear.


The quality of the dress isn't excellent (thin material and some questionable stitching in places) but it's super cute and flattering. I usually wear a large in dresses but tend to order up a size when ordering online. HOWEVER, after reading the other reviews I stuck with a large and it fits great. You will definitely have to wear something underneath but a simple black, tank dress should do the trick. I'm happy with my purchase.


This is a lovely dress.  However, the rayon fabric shrinks when washed and the dress becomes too small in the bust area.  I followed the washing instructions and washed in my home machine cold water, on delicate cycle.  I hung it to dry.  Now I cannot wear it.  Trust me, I like this dress so much that I bought it twice - and twice it shrunk after washing.  I am very frustrated with Milumia.


Love this dress! I've had so many compliments. Ordered a size XXL of the navy and green. It hangs well, flows nicely, sweeps the floor slightly with flats. I wear it somewhat boho style with a tank top underneath (I don't find this print to be see through, but it is low cut for me).  I ordered up so that I could wear it and look somewhat waif-like. 5'6", 36B, 135, size 8-10 jeans


This dress is GORGEOUS!  I love it so much.  Would buy again.  1000 times over!


Pretty dress, but it was way too small! This dress is Asian sized. I wanted to love this dress but it just didnâ€™t work out for me so I returned it. Please be aware this dress runs small. I bought a large but it was more like a small and I always buy large in maxi dresses and they all  fit just right or sometimes too big but never had I come across one that was too small.


Bought this for my engagement photos and it was perfect, comfortable, and flowy! I have a thick pear shape body and this dress made me look lean and long. Great dress!ğŸ‘�
