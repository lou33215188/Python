This dress is amazing. I wore it for the first time while I was shopping, and I literally got at least 30 compliments. Definitely ordering another color, as the fit is very flattering.


I love this dress!!! I am usually a Large, but since Iâ€™m a bit chesty; I ordered an XL, it fit perfectly. I wore this to a photo shoot the first night ğŸ˜�


Amazing! Just bought it in three more colors.


Size 12 ordered large. 175/5â€™3


I wanted to love it, but even throwing it in the dryer on delicate when it was dry with a semi dry towel caused it to shrink and insane amount. It was a complete waste of money.


Beautiful dress!! It is a little long so you must wear hills. I have plans to purchase another one on he near future.


love it!!!! extremely comfy, I will buy another color agian


Very poor sawing. Came apart after 2nd washing by hands.Disappointed because like the fashion a lot.


love this dress very much because of the way it flows and the length of it.  also loves the material very much. I took a size larger because it comes smaller than expected. But truly love it.


Extremely poorly made.  Dress was missing a button, and one of the cords with the tassel was damaged and only holding together with s thread


Sleeves are tight
