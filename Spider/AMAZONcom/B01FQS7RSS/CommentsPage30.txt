This dress is SUPER CUTE. I love it. However, I had to return it because I have very large breasts--and even though I ordered a large--it did not fit in the bust. It has a very high waist and the elastic was up on my boobs instead of below them. but I love the dress. I'm sorry it didn't work for me. I hope it works for you!


The design is very flattering. Being somewhat apple shaped this dress enhances the top half while hiding the middle below beautifully flowing material. The wrinkles from packaging ironed out easily. The material feels soft and is only a little see through. Purchased the predominantly black design and also the cream and love them both equally.


I'm a 36C and typically wear a size 12 or large and they both fit very comfortably. Not tight and no gaping at the buttons.


Fits perfect even with a baby bump!


Was a little leery, but after reading several reviews ordered this dress and Iâ€™m glad I did. It fits perfectly on my 5â€˜6â€œ frame and has plenty of room for my broad shoulders, 38D bust, and well-developed biceps. Just brushes the floor when Iâ€™m barefoot so will work well with sandals or heels. Not a dressy dress but good for casualwear very comfortable and girly.


Very beautiful dress. I read 'bad' reviews and not sure where those coming from. I am very happy with the dresses. Bought 2 of different patterns. It does not concern me that they come wrinkled - wash them and wrinkles go away. Love them all!


I'm 5'2" ,152lbs,  ordered large, nice dress, fit good,sleeves slightly small but not too tight, sewed nice, need to cut about 6" off hem, way too long.  purchased another with short sleeves, different color, same size, fit is smaller, buttons gap, length is just to floor on me, sewed crooked, decorative string tie was sewn in belly area instead of bodice area I cut them off. Prints on both dresses accurate to photo.  Nice dress for the price, sizes are not consistent with product.


Beautiful dress.. already got complementsğŸ˜�


This dress is absolutely stunning! The flowing of the skirt and the pattern is very flattering. I get so many compliments every where I go in this dress. I am 5'4" and 150 lbs with large breasts and the medium is a bit big on me.


Material completely creased.  Looked like it had been rolled in a ball in a damp room.  Fit was perfect.


I like my clothes neat and pressed and well kept looking.


Liked the medium sleeves.


I had purchased the blue previously and it was perfect.


Pros:


Dress design and fabric pattern were beautiful


Very lightweight and flowy


Flattering style


Cons:


Buttons all popped off within an hour of me putting on the dress


You can't see it in the picture, but the entire front of the dress is about 25 tiny buttons with bad quality fabric loops to attach the buttons to. They didn't work, and they also fell off


The fabric itself was low quality -- it felt slimy and damp.


Seams were not well done, and many of them were not fully sewn shut.


I normally wear a 4 in dresses and it was too small.
