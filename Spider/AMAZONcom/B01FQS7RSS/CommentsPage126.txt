I bought two of these dresses.  One had a seam that was not finished.  I returned it. No problem.


The other had buttons missing.  I had to pay for shipping to manufacturer.  Still have not received a refund.


Be aware of this.


I love the print I ordered, its a light weight, comfortable material... BUT, it is too small for my chest. Maybe I should have paid better attention to the sizing chart. (I'm around a 38DDD)


Love love love this dress...I expected this dress to be too long since im short (5'1) but it fit like a Glove . I ordered Xl since im on the plus size and im very glad I did . I will definitely be purchasing many more dresses from this seller !


Love this dress. Fit is true to size chart.


This dress fit just about perfect on me! The bust was a little revealing, but I just pined it up in the back. I would recommend this dress & will be buying another.


Such a beautiful dress! Going to buy different colors


VERY long!! I'm 5 ft. 11" and it touches the ground on me! Will need to return it or hem it myself!? Pretty material & made well - waist was higher than I anticipated, but then I am taller than average. Nicely done.


Too small. Get a size bigger


Comfortable and cute!


Love this dress perfect with jacket too!
