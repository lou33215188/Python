Great fit, beautiful dress. Lots of compliments.


Love it! Best dress I've bought. Getting one in white soon! ‚ù§


Beautiful and flowy! Love!!


Not true to size. Too short.


Felt so elegant and beautiful in it!


So pretty! Great buy


Liked sleeve length and neckline. Had to shorten length.


I love it!  The sizing was right on, the colors vibrant, and the fabric feels good on me.


I ordered two of these dresses and love them! Unfortunately, the Navy_beige dress started tearing after the first wash.


so pretty but does not fit the shoulders well and I ordered a large to prevent that.
