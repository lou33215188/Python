Too small and too long


This dress is so flattering and I have received so many compliments. It is super comfy and I can be in it all day!


I got a bajillion compliments on this dress. The quality is good, and it fit true to size. Great buy!


Beautiful, flowy dress!!! Light weight material. Can't wait to wear it!!!


Beautiful, flattering dress. I ordered a large- I am 5'0" and had to get taken up a bit in the shoulders and hemmed. My bust is 36DD and I weigh 140. I highly recommend.


Loved this on me! The dress is extremely comfortable to wear.  However, I will get a size smaller to try next time.


Pretty dress but looked like old lady colors when it came in.


Thanks, great pretty dress!


This dress was so small. I ordered a large and I couldn't even get it on. Very misleading sizing.


It my first time ordering clothes but dress was absolutely gorgeous and fit perfect. Ty Amazon for making things easy!
