very pretty


Terrible fabric and way too small.  Very cheaply made.  I am so disappointed I missed out on the return window.


Beautiful


Fun light weight dress for the beach.


Great dress. I'm 5'3 and the length was fine.


Very gorgeous dress and fit was good. Flowy and airy!


Slightly tight in the sleeves when I move my arms forward. Also, I have a large chest so its a little tight across. But I can still wear it for hours without being uncomfortable. Even with that, it still looks fantastic.


Pretty dress but very long. I'm 5'7" and even with heels on the bottom touched the ground.


Looked amazing and true to color fit great until I ripped in the back..have no idea how but I didn't even hear it either..ruined!


Nicer than expected. The XL fits like as a USA M/L(10/12). The upper arms are a little narrow but wearable.
