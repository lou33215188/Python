A Few Things to be mindful of:


-I ordered a large solely based on the sizing chart on the top of the page - which is different from the one below with photos of the specific dresses. Pay more attention to the sizing chart with the photos.


-This dress buttons all the way up the front and because I am all legs the buttons only came about five or so inches from my crotch, so just be aware of that. The slit never flew open or felt provocative but had there been a great gust of wind, it would be possible.


-It's pretty low cut, so if that's not your thing, wear a tank-top or a bandeau. I ended up wearing a bandeau and it was still pretty low.


-The material on this dress is flowy and flattering. Though in bright light you could see my silhouette. I generally wear medium shirts and have a 36DD chest and the large had a lot of room left in it. I could have gotten away with a medium as far as the bust goes.


-The length of the dress seemed a little short to me, it hit right at my ankles. I am 5'7". I ended up wearing it with sandals because it was too short when I put on heels.


All in all, I was incredibly comfortable in this dress and would buy it in different patterns. I just wanted to post this because these are all questions I was asking as I looked at this dress!


I am OBSESSED with this dress! I feel like a princess in it and am so happy with the fit, style and quality. This was everything I hoped it would be.


Beautiful cotton dress. I wear it with fitted jeans and heels. It looks as good as pictured (purchased the Beige_yellow combination). It's actually a bit large, so I'll be taking it in at the waist, I'm 5'6.5" tall and wear a size 10-12.


(the product description says Rayon..the label in my dress says Cotton)


I really don't like leaving bad reviews, but this dress deserves a scathing review. According to Milumia's sizing chart for the 3/4 length sleeve dress, the XXL should have fit me pretty close. The torso is loose, but that I could live and expected with BUT for the dress length/hem is at least 6 inches too long ON THE LEFT SIDE and the right side barely brushes the floor! Ridiculous! How this was acceptable to ship to a customer is beyond me. I'm posting the pictures of this. I have on shoes with a 2 inch wedge and you can see the crooked hem for yourself. I'm 5'4" tall, wear a size 10 on top and a size 8 on the bottom. This 56" length dress should have been a perfect length and it IS on the right side ONLY and 6 inches too long on the left.


To Amazon: Don't you think it's time to require clothing being sold to Americans to be made according to USA size charts/sizing? I have sent back so many items of "Made in China, according to Chinese sizing charts" that I have lost count. It's beyond ridiculous now.


I now have to decide if I keep this dress and have it hemmed and altered in the torso, or send it back. It's a pretty dress, but this lack of QC infuriates me. I'm leaning towards returning this because no one should profit off such garbage they call a dress.


See the pictures of this horrendously FLAWED dress.


Love the fabric, love the print and got lots of compliments about it!! ğŸ˜�


I love it! I'm 5'10", 5 months pregnant and ordered a size small.


This dress could not be more perfect if it tried! It fit perfectly (I am between a 4-6 in women's dresses and I ordered the small). It is flowy and has lots of fabric to make it look expensive. Also, it is the most comfortable dress I own. I plan on buy every color!


I ordered this dress in two different colors both a size small.  They are super cute.  They are slightly different cuts and fit differently as a result.  One of them really works with my body (5'4, size 4/6, 34ddd, hourglass).  The other one has a slightly higher waist band that doesn't accent my curves as well.  The material is totally different.  One of them is similar to sheets and the other one is a thicker material, almost like a very thin canvas.  Other than the general style, you would not be able to tell the two colors are the same dress/from the same company.


I like them b/c the button loops are elastic, allowing the dress to stretch where it needs to but stay form fitting elsewhere (in my case, making room for the ladies, but being tight on my waist).  The fabric in the front is heavier than the back, resulting in the dress slipping down to a slightly scandalous low cut.  That's a bit frustrating b/c I wanted to wear it to the office, but it works well for every other situation.  It's comfortable enough to lounge around the house in but cute enough to go out.  Very good combo.  When I wear it out of the house I do have to wear it with heels (small 1.5'' pumps) so it doesn't drag, but it's not unreasonably long like most maxi dresses are on anyone shorter than 5'8.


I would definitely have given this dress 5 stars because I love it, but it tore at the seam on my back shoulder after wearing it twice.  Fortunately the material allows it to be fixed at home so it's not the end of this dress, but I am still a little disappointed.


I don't have a full length picture of the dress but wanted to attach one to show the bustier ladies out there that it can handle some chest.  This is even a size small.  I typically have to get dresses in medium or large to fit properly.


This showed up at my door in terrible shape, the seams were a mess, and there were threads hanging off all over the neckline. This dress was a very poor quality and I will be returning it.


This dress overall is beautiful. The material is very comfortable and light without feeling cheap. I am 5'2, 120lbs and I ordered a small, which fits a little on the loose side on the waist and also a tad long but I wouldn't size down as I feel that would be a bit tight in the arms. With all that being said I am thinking of exchanging this dress since mine came with an uneven stitching on the buttons. The center of my dress is so very off on the center lining and looks like I missed a button / or buttoned incorrectly. The bottom of the dress was cut uneven so I would have to get it altered so that way it's not longer on one side compared to the other, but considering how sloppy it looks because of the misalignment I wouldn't expense in the cost of having this altered.
