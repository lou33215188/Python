The dress itself is beautiful. I just need it hemmed since I'm 4'11 and sinched ok the side cause the medium was a little loose.


I'm on the larger side though, so it was to be expected. A quick trip to the tailor fixed it. Lovely dress though.


This dress is gorgeous! I'm a photographer and this dress would look so beautiful in photographs. It fits great, is light and comfortable, and makes you feel so pretty when you wear it!


Q bought xxl, it was still small on my arms


Love the dress. I'm 5'4 150lbs and I got the medium. I'm going to get a few other colors!


Everyone loved the full skirt and tiny buttons.


I received the wrong color, but I keep it


The dress fit but way to small in the arms  So disappointed that's why the garment was returned


It looks gorgeous. It fits perfectly.I am in love with this dress.


The floral dress is pretty but the fit especially the armpit and sleeve was too tight. Not a good fit
