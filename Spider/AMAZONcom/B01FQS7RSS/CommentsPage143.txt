The elastic waistband comes up to right underneath the bra line as opposed to at the natural waist like it's shown on the model, and the whole neckline is much higher, making it horribly unflattering.


This dress is perfect!  I ordered a size larger than normal due to the fact that most items run small. Not the case here.  It's pretty much true to size.  Light and flowing fabric. Beyond my expectations.


I was worried this was going to be too long or too small. I got a medium and it fit incredible. I'm only 5'4" and did wear it with heels, but I love everything about it.


Everyone says it looks great.


Love this dress.  However, I will have to have it hemmed, way too long for me. I'm 5'0". Wish it came in a petite option. The fabric has a lovely feel and drapes beautifully.


Too short. I’m 5’7” and it goes to above my ankles. Not flattering.


Love how it looks....


Love these dresses, fits perfectly and were my favorite summer dress. Plan to buy more in different prints, I love the flowy skirts!


Beautiful dress! I love the fabric. The first time I wore it i received multiple complements every place I went.


Great dress
