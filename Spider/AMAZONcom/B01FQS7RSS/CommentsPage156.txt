Love this dress! I'm a size 14 and ordered an XL and fits perfect! I'm 5'4" and doesn't drag on the floor.


I love this dress so much ğŸ˜˜ğŸ˜˜ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


Perfect dress!! Comfortable, flowy, and beautiful


Same as the pictures. Ordered a size up and fit as expected.


Thank you


Absolutely perfect!  Love how light and flowy it is. I got so many compliments. Planning to order more in different colors.


Beautiful as shown in picture.


Loved the dress at first but it shrunk so bad in the first washing it was unusable ğŸ˜©


The sleeves were too tight and the body was too loose. Not flattering.


Perfect!  No complaints.
