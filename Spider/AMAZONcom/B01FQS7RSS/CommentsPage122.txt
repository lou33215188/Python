Fun, flirty, and feminine, you can't go wrong with this dress!


I absolutely LOVE this dress!  It has a fitted bodice area with the skirt and sleeves that flow as I walk.  The waist can also be belted.


Great value


Super cute dress, but the sleeves have absolutely NO give and are way too tight. I ordered the size suggested, but because the sleeves were so tight, the top portion of the dress completely smushed my chest down.


Pretty dress, but doesn't fit in the arm or boob region. If you carry your weight in either of those places, look elsewhere.


Beautiful!


The bottom of the dress is crooked.


Loved it!! It is really flattering. The length is nice and the bust is spot on. If you are looking for a flowy/fancy/laid back look.


I was so surprised by the absolutely perfection of this dress. I need every single print available. It’s flowy and incredibly flattering. I’m short and curvy so that’s a miracle.


I love it gets lots of compliments
