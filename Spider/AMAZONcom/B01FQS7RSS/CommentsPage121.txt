Size up if u have big breast


Very cute dress! I'm about 5'5 and bought a size Large 1st, was too big, exchanged for a size Medium


I love it and got so many compliments on it. It fits true to size.


Gorgeous dress. Fit as expected. Nice flowy fabric that isn't too thin.


Fits a little snug on the arm.  Very cute though


Perfect fit and lovely dress. I will use to Spring or to Autum. Very comfortable and fashion. Maybe will try buy more!


Loved the dress! The fabric is lovely however the fit runs small so whatever your normal size go up one


It is amazing


Love this dress! Fit perfectly - I'm 5'8" so of course it won't be floor length or anything on me, but it's beautiful. Exactly what I hoped for when I bought it


I love this dress. I think colors are great for fall.
