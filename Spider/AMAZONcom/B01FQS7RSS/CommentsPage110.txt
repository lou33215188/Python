This is a very pretty dress. BUT VERY small. I wear a size 12 and bought a xlg. It was still to small.


I've just ordered a bunch more of these dresses. Gorgeous flow and fit, they wash well, and are my favorites for spring and summer. Highly recommend.


If you usually wear small or mediums in dresses i think its safe to go with the smaller size. Also the print isn't as pretty/bright as it looks in the pictures. :(


So perfect! I normally wear a small but ordered a medium based on the reviews! It fits great!


Needed ironed, badly. Looked great afterward. I got the extra small. I am 5'4" 100# and probably 32 26 34 top to bottom. I used the tassel as a belt of sorts and the length is perfect to wear with reasonable heals but not too long to step on when wearing flats.


Love the dress! But...should have purchased an XS and the thin material makes it difficult to find appropriate underwear.


I loved, it's so nice! The colors, the material it's amazing! I will buy another color,,,,


I am going to reorder a bigger size.


Terrible fabric, and seaming. I returned it


This dress is sheer and unlined.  Also, the waist on this dress is very high, so if you have a long upper torso like I do, the waistband will awkwardly cut you across the chest instead of underneath, where the empire waist should be.  It will also shrink a little in the wash, so maybe order a size larger.
