Great dress and very comfortable! Had lots of compliments!


The dress and style is cute. Just not quite what i was looking for!


I love these dresses! This is my second. I'm stopped on the street constantly and asked where I bought it and how beautiful it is. I feel pretty! It fits perfectly! I'm 5'9 210lbs and the xxl fits perfectly.


I absolutely love love this dress! Fabric feels great and fits great! I am 5'6' and 130 pounds and wear a size 34C bra and the small is perfect. I ordered 2 different colors I liked this dress soon much!


It's okay.  It's really long.  I'm 5'10"  and it feels too long for me....


I purchased this dress for a family photo shoot in the mountains and it was perfect. I got a lot of complements on it as well. I'm 5'4" and 115 pounds and I ordered a size small it it fit perfect.


It is a beautiful dress but... It is a little tight in the sleeves but too big in the waist area. There is a little tie in the waist area I thought I could pull it to tighten it, but can't do it. But overall, it is a good dress.


Tends to run large. And is see through. You might want to wear something underneath the dress in bright sunlight


the v neck was way too deep
