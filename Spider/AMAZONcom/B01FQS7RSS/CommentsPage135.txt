I love the dress and the price... will buy more : )


I really like this dress. Heads up that it's a bit see-thru. I like the dress so much that I returned the small for an x-small and am buying a slip to combat the thinner material. I'm 5'2", 125 lbs.


Very pretty, but very thin material.  Need a slip.  Returned because 2x made in China is apparently different than 2x USA!  Sizing not even close


It's decent, but ripped. Fabric is not great quality


I returned this dress. Loved the colors and material but the top part was too small. I am a 36c and medium. If I got a large it would have been too big.


Although I rated a somewhat small I knew by measurements provided I neede to order a size larger and itâ€™s perfect. For the money this dress is just exactly what I wanted


Beautiful dress.  It arrived very wrinkled otherwise I would give it 5 stars.


If you have a larger chest this dress does not work. It's so pretty and seems well made. I'm hoping I can wear it once I'm done breast feeding.


I love this dress! I bought this to wear to work as a cute summer, casual dress, and I've already worn it even outside of work! The fabric is so soft, and the colors on it are beautiful.  Definitely recommend this dress.


I bought one in every color
