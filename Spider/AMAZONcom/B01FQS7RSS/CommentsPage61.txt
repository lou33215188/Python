Super cute dress. Great fabric color. But the buttons are small and hooks are a pain. the fabric stretched out while I was wearing it so I had to pin it to my bra so my boobs didn't pop out. Too much work. sent back.


This is a beautiful dress, but it shrinks like Rayon always does, so the bodice now fits high on the bustline. Must lose weight for spring season or I can't wear it anymore!


Beautiful fit, very flattering. I'm 5'7" 38-30-40 and it fits very well. The hem brushes the top of my feet, and the material is light and soft.


Love this dress, so many compliments!  Iâ€™d love to find a knee-length version for travel.  Highly recommend delicate wash and hang dry because I could see it fraying easily.


Love this dress.  It is quite long for the average person.  I am 5'9'' and it came to my ankles.  It took it to Hawaii and it travels beautifully and was cool and very showy.  I got several complements from people I didn't know.  I give it 5 stars for sure.


Bought this as a travel dress.  Love the fabric and flattering design of the dress.  It is lightweight so definitely a spring/summer dress.


Love this dress! It fits beautifully and flows so well. It is a little sheer however.


Quite a flattering design.


It is a little larger than I thought in the bust and waist, but with a tank underneath to cover the "plunge" it is OK.  My husband loves the way it looks on me.  I got lots of compliments, and it is very comfortable for the hot weather.


In love with this dress, I have the same in a few different colors, so comfortable and flattering!
