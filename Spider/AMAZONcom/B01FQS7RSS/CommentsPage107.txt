Beautiful! Perfect length too!


This dress in navy is everything! Ordered my regular size, medium, and it fits great with room to breathe. I received so many compliments on this one.


Returned.


This dress is nice!  The skirt is VERY full and feels like you are wearing a lot of fabric but it is lovely on and fits well.  Very classy.  Perfect for a garden party or something


Comfortable and cute. Fits a little smaller in the chest size, I would order up if you are somewhat top heavy


Beautiful, comfortable, head-turning dress.


I might even start wearing dresses to church again!


Flowy, flattering, perfect for spring! It looks gorgeous with mahogany tall boots.  It's the perfect Mother's Day present for myself!


I am thrilled with this product! It fit like a charm. I am 5'2" and it is about 2 inches too long, but it fits my 40D bust with no gapping or pulling. I am definitely going to purchase in multiple patterns.


Very small sizing
