I ordered the white blue dress with 3/4 sleeves in medium(I am between a size 4&6). The item came in good condition. No flaws nor damage.


Style: 8/10 it is flattering for any figure. You can dress it up to attend a party or go to church in or dress it down. If you do not like intricate numerous buttons then this is not for you.  Length is just at the ankles (I am 5â€™6â€�)


Quality of cloth material:  6/10 The cloth used is of a light material almost see through but low quality. you will have to handwash this in cold water. The washing machine and dryer will ruin this dress.  It is the kind that probably rips apart easily. The good news is that it dries quite quickly.


Price: 5/10 although $27 is a relatively inexpensive price for a dress, for this particular dress a fair price range would be in the range of $17-22 considering the material used and quality. As with all products from China you get what you pay for.


Am I happy with it? More of okay with it.  It is not a dress that sparks joy.


Will I order it again? It all depends. Maybe if (like most of the reviews) I get compliments on it from random people then I might order again. ğŸ˜� ğŸ˜…


Ohmergersh. This dress.


I was nervous about where it would land length wise as I'm 5'10" and typically have trouble with maxi dresses and whether they'll land at an awkward length. Even though initially it felt a little short, I tried it with varying shoes and ended up falling in love.


Super comfortable, super flattering, and so many compliments. I got the XL, which fit well, was a little loose around the waist- but I'm very hourglass shaped so that's not uncommon. Tried to belt it, but ended up taking the belt off and it was just fine.


Definitely want to get one or two more of these!


I really wanted to like this but it was an unusual cut. I bought my normal size (xl) and the dress fit in the body but the sleeves were more like a medium and felt like sausage casings. The bust of the dress was also small for its size. The rest of the dress fit great and even if there had been a 2x in this I feel it still would have fit awkwardly. It's a shame because this was something I really wanted to wear and looked nice on aside from the arms and the bodice.


I LOVE this dress and would have 10 of them if my budget could spare.


The flow and fit are amazing. Love the elastic slimming waist.


The sleeves are perfect length adorned with closing buttons.


The dress looks great on.


Absolutely beautiful.  Its very long.  I am 5'3 and it reaches my ankles.  Very flowing and falls perfectly.  The only issue that I have are the buttons.  I love that it has many buttons because it makes the dress look even sexier/flattering but the buttons are not all that functional due to their size.  They are very small so I would not recommend unbuttoning all of the buttons.  There is no need to because the dress slips over your head without using buttons.  I purchased a medium and I just love the fit.  It is not too tight around the chest area.  I will be looking for more dresses from Milumia.


This dress came stuffed in a plastic bag.  It looked like it was used, all wrinkled and a mess. When I finally got all the buttons buttoned up there were 2 buttons missing from the dress. The presentation and the dress itself is very cheap looking. The dress is big and the arms are tight. I am extremely disappointed and want a refund.


I LOVE this dress. I feel like a genius in it. Why? Because everyone else is wearing clothes, and I'm basically in a dress looks like clothes and feels like PJs. <3 I'm going to get more for sure. (P.s. I also tried the short sleeved versions of these- they were awful on me!!)


But, for those of you thinking about these 3/4 sleeved dresses, it's buyer beware on size. I bought several to try, then had to buy several more cause I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the sizes. I've got photos here showing several in Ss & XSs. Some of the smalls are the same as the XS, and some are bigger and 4-7 inches longer than the other XSs and Ss. I couldn't figure out any pattern to this. Just a manufacturers defect I suppose. But it was several different styles with this problem. Just don't get one without a backup plan if you're going to a specific event soon. Leave yourself time to get the right one! But, I highly recommend them if you can adjust and plan for that sizing part!


This dress fabric is nice, cool rayon....which is nice, but it's a lot of fabric and a whole lot of pattern which made me look like a religious person....my husband laughed at it and asked if my sister wives made the dress for me. There's even little Poof's at the shoulders which look ridiculous...they aren't in the photos either, but they were there. It's very 90's country style....just not attractive. The waist was huge too...there is a waist string but it's not a drawstring....just decorative. The chest area was not long enough length wise so the elastic waste area was high up and cut across the middle of my chest. I got a 2x...I wear a 2x typically in US sizes too, but this was bigger than I thought. I'm 5'11" and it's made for a much shorter person I guess...also someone with a shorter/flatter chest and torso.


Love this dress! I ordered two for my baby shower, one for myself and a matching XS one for my daughter. I got a size Large for myself after reading other reviews, Iâ€™m 32 weeks pregnant, 180lbs 5â€™2â€� I have narrow shoulders but am pretty big everywhere else at this stage, I was worried about the waist but it fits with room to spare. Really is a perfect fit and very comfy, also no slip required! I may even have been able to wear a size medium. My daughter is 11, about 5â€™2â€� and 90lbs and the size XS fit her a little loosely. I may wash hers so that it shrinks up a bit but it looks great on her even with some room.


Do not order if you are over 5'5". I am 5'9", and typically wear a 14/16, or XL. I upsized to the XXL to accommodate the sleeves to my large arm size. The sleeves fit.  The torso on this is so short. The under-bust elastic sits right over my boobs (I'm only a D). The length is above my ankles. The fabric is very pretty, and the style looks nice on the hanger. Just did not fit me one bit.
