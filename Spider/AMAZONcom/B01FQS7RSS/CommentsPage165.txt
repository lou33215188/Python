Love!!!! Love!!!! Love the dress!!!


Compliments galore! I ordered SEVEN of these in different patterns because of how much I loved the first two. Everyone loves them, including hubs. They are flattering af and somehow manage to be sexy, classy, and sort-of modest.  (I know, right?)


 I think I will have to dry clean though, I'm very concerned with shrinking, it's that shrinky- rayon seeming material. I am 5'5" and about 160 I think, I have hourglass shape, but not super busty. With flats the dress is juust too long to walk up stairs without stepping on it a bit. Wear a heel. Doesn't need to be super high though.


The dress arrived like a squeezed wet rag,  including one thousand wrinkles!


Just a little too loose on the waist line.


Beautiful dress and great fit.


Amazing! Effortlessly beautiful!


Love it.


Outfit just as pictured.  Fit well.
