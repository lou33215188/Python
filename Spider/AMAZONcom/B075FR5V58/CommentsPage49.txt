I wear as a simple swing dress or sometimes with leggings.  Really like it for casual summer attire.


Very comfortable and better than wearing shorts in the summer time.  Paired with leggings looks even better!


This is a cute, casual and comfortable dress.  The material is like a thick t-shirt; made better than I expected for the price.  I decided to order up in size when I saw it was high cotton blend and I'm glad I did.  The size is a little snug in arms. Great dress for the price!


Short!  Way too short as a dress for me.  I'm 5'9".


Love this. Perfect fit. Ordered large, I am 5'7  and 150. It's so cong for the hot summer days, or beach wear.


Love this dress. Cute for the summer and not too heavy.


Looks exactly as it does in the picture and true to size. I am 5'5 and ordered a medium and it is the perfect length.


I'm 5 ft tall and got the smallest size, it was still pretty long on me and too wide in the hips. I kept it because I think it is comfortable and I love the colors.


I saw this on a B-Feed article about great but inexpensive dresses on Amazon. I purchased this and now live in it. Super soft but really nice thick material. I was worried it might be a thin/transparent material bc of the low price but was luckily proved wrong. If you want a cute, sustainable (washes well!) t-shirt dress, get this!


I bought this 2 sizes larger then normal and its fits perfect alittle short but i love it


Sized way smaller than expected. Fabric was way cheaper than expected, returned.
