Fits nice and is super comfortable. Great value!


The tunic was well made. I didn't care for the fit on me. I'm fairly short and it was too long on me. It's a cute dress/tunic, though.


I say as expected because I expected it to be tight up top and flowy on the bottom. if you want a tighter fit order a size down. kind triangular shaped. I love it. will be perfect for beach trips and casual weekend outtings


cute colors but a little tight at the top in the chest and shoulders.  I still wear it though.  It is very stretchy and comfortable


Love this dress. Good material and fit as expected. Im 5'1" and dress was the perfect length. Not too short or too long.


Close but no cigar. Probably better if you're chest is a bit smaller.  It was really tight across the arms and chest and yet hung nice and loose over the belly and hips.


I only say it was kind of large because I am short 5"1 and it fit longer than I would Like (at the knee but not above it).  Overall, very nice day dress, soft material.


Maybe it will shrink a little.


I thought this dress was so cute in the picture. The material is somewhat stretchy, kinda like spandex and a t-shirt were combined. The fit is terrible. It is big in the body and not flattering, but also too short. I don't know where I would be able to wear this appropriately. I am 5'7 and got the medium. The colors look like the picture though and it arrived quick.


This dress is perfect. Comfortable, good quality, and fits perfectly. Looks just like the picture.


Small in the shoulders and very wide bell in the waist/hips that did not lie flatly. I'm 5'4" with a muscular build. Very unflattering on me.
