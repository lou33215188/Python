Nice dress fits just perfect


I ordered the short sleeve multi color in medium.  Fits perfect and is super comfortable.  Love It!!


Material did not feel like cotton......too slick and clingy.


The pictures of this dress make it look like it has a wide neck, but the neck is actually a really tight/close t-shirt style neck.


in the first wash, the dark part of the ombre leeched into the top light part, staining it


Happy with it.  Comfortable.


simple and fun style...T-shirts are always cool


XL is more like a large.


Not too long, can be dressed up or down, even hides stains. Plus I never rate anything, so take note. If this isn't in your closet  .... get it there ASAP!!


Love it.  I took everyone's advice and ordered a size up. Fits great. A large may have fit but the XL seems to fit just great too.  I was worried about it being too short but it is perfect!
