It is beautiful but definitely not a 4x, as my 11 year old daughter who's only 80 pounds fits into it like a night gown in her size.


Very soft. Fits well. Very comfortable. I'm happy with my dress.


Like this dress. Fits comfortably and the color is pretty. Would order again .


The color was exactly like the picture, however, it is not as loose at the top as I would like it to be. If I went up a size I would drown in it so I suggest staying at your normal size.


Cute dress, but arms and chest area were very, very tight. It's not the soft spandex you'd expect. More like a thick compression garment without a lot of give. Not worth sending back...


too small returned


Really liked this for a great swim cover up.  Looks good for quick stop at grocery store.  Good bargain.


Runs very small.  Nice color looks good just runs small


Great colors, but way too short for me. I'm 5'3" and #147, ordered a medium. It fit, just way too short for me to wear as a dress. Will keep and wear as a long tshirt.


It is comfortable. Fits like a glove on the top. Bottom is flowy. Color is okay (I got the grey/blue).
