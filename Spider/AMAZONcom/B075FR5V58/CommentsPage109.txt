Jesus this dress is SHORT.  I am not a tall person by any means and my whole butt was showing within seconds.  Dang guys!


Great quality and soft material.  Super comfy.  Always gets compliment when I wear it.


Really cute dress.  Fits as expected and is comfortable.  I would recommend to a friend.


I liked the dress but it was way off in size.  I runs extremely small...order accordingly.


Very short on me. (5'7")  and very clingy........


Very cute but runs VERY large.  Had to return.


Love it!!!!!


Way too small in the bust. Nice fabric. Gave it to my sister!


Super cute & fits great!


I ordered a 4x and it was so small my daughter who is a size large could not get it on.  gave it to a girl at work who is a size 8 and it fit her
