Super cute!  Love it.  True to size and color.


Love this dress!  Was between ordering a medium or small, went with medium and probably could have sized down. However, definitely not disappointed. It's very flowy and not too short (5'6" about 142lbs). Was able to wear to work and was office appropriate. Love the green to blue ombr√©. Wish this came in other better colors to order 10 more!  Can't beat it for the price!


Cute little dress.  Would have loved it if it was true to size. Gave it away.


Love the fabric and quality of this casual dress. Bought large even though I often wear medium based on other reviews to make sure it would fit bustline.


Loved this dress. Fits true to size. I even bought another color. Highly recommend it due to how comfortable it is!


Fits perfectly, cute, high-quality material


Wore on vacation! Was perfecthe for the weather. It is short.


It's a gift but I think it will be perfect!


Cute and nice  color.  Looks like the picture


I got a small and it was kind of baggy in all areas and wasn't very flattering. I did not wear it after I tried it on.
