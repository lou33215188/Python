Love the fit and the colors are gorgeous.


Love this dress! It is so comfortable and nice and loose...hides a multiple of sins!! Would love another color!


This is the perfect dress! Love it!


Beautiful dress. Fits like expected and made well. I love it!!


This dress is exactly as in picture! Simple yet cute and so comfortable!


It doesn't fit as loosely as shown in the picture, the material is thick and structured. It's still a really good dress, it'll be perfect for summer!


I am 5'0" and 160 lbs, and the XL fits great. It is pretty short on me compared to most dress fits, so I can imagine it would be too short on anyone who is an average height.


Beautiful dress


Very comfy.  Great color.
