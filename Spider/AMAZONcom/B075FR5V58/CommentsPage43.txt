Love the colors, perfect summer dress. Not binding at all. Good quality and weight to fabric, not sheer.


The dress is a little larger than I expected and not quite flattering to my body shape so I don't wear it as much as I expected, but with a belt (I need a waist) it could be improved. It is still very comfortable to wear and well made. It would work great as a swimsuit coverup or maternity dress.


Very comfortable. The color looks just like the picture. I am 5’1” and it is just above knee


Good quality fabric and the dress has some shape to it.  Love the way the colors blend from green to blue.  Very pleased.


I love this dress-- it's simple, and amazing. I am 5' even, and it hung to my knees. Very modest, relaxed material, and can be dressed up with the right accessories. For under $15, it's a total steal!


Nice casual summer dress


Not the best quality but fine for the price


Not in love with the material, but overall it's a great looking dress at a really good price!  I wear a large, purchased a large and it fits good.


Not as soft as other similar dresses I’ve bought from here but it’s cute


I love this T-shirt dress. I would have rated it a 5 but it was smaller than I expected in the shoulders and chest.


I'm too long-legged to wear this as a dress (and probably too old also!) but it looks great with leggings, which is what I bought it for. Dress it up or down. Soft and comfortable. Only complaint: a small whole at the seam under one arm. Easily fixed.
