Great dress. Comfy and soft. Fits as expected. Colors are great.


GAVE AWAY


I love this dress. Super soft stretchy material. Fits exactly like the picture. Will order this again in another color. I even wore it with jeans and it fit like a shirt that goes over your butt.


Cute top a little snug for the design of the top. I'd suggest sizing up one


Super cute. 5'10 and hit mid thigh. Perfect to wear down to the beach as a cover up.


Really cute dress. 4 stars because it's a little short when I raise my arms. Otherwise it's great. Good material and it gets compliments


Very cute but soooo small.


Very comfortable! I have a larger bust and this was a bit  tight up top although not too tight to wear!


I got a large in the green blue umbre and normally wear a large and love this dress. Perfect for casual gatherings. Color was as pictured.


love this dress so comfy
