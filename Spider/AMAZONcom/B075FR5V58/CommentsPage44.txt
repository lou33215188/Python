Ran about 3 sizes too small


It's a shame because it's so pretty.


Beautiful dress. I did not keep it since it was too short for me and a little large on the waist. I would recommend you at least try it. I see some people have found it fits them nicely.


I was very pleased with the quality of the fabric, it was not thin at all, and it fit just right, just above the knee for me.


I am very happy with this tunic like tee.  It is cool and comfortable for summer wear.


A little short but if I were younger it would be fine . I will think young when I wear itğŸ˜Š


This is super cute and flattering! The color is as expected, and the fabric is fairly high quality! It is not supposed to be a tight dress, so it will be big and loose, especially at the bottom. I can't wait to pair it with a long, gold necklace and wear it to everything!


I bought it based on reviews. Pleasantly surprised! It's made of stretchy cotton material. It fits well and can be worn with or without a belt. Color is as pictured. I love it! It's a cute summer dress.


Love the color, fit, and quality of this dress.  Perfect for the summer. Not too short or long for 5'5" person. I don't think it's too wide as a swing dress as well.


The fit was fine. A bit tight in the arms and quite short but I plan on using it as a beach cover up and/or sleep shirt. So it works for me.


Great dress! Light weight, soft fabric and washes well! Ordered a large incase it shrunk after washing, however it did not shrink and a medium would have been a better fit (normally I am an 8-10 size).
