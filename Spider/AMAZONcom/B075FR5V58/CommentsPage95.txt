really loved it my first went!  it did shrink a little bit after washing and is now maybe a tad too short but I am a big girl at 215lbs  and 5'7 soooo I still love it but now wear bicycle shorts underneath.


Super cute dress!


Cute and comfy!


Loved this dress so much After I  tried it on  I ordered another one  Love the material  and fit!!!


Fabric is thick, nice color. Fit tight


Received alot of comments, and the color is amazing. I am 108lbs and my height is 1.61cm, a little loose, but I like it that way. Will use this when I am pregnant in the near future


Color was accurate and material is wonderfully soft... but be sure to put on some accessories- I didnt and heard whispers about being in my pajamas lol


Love this dress! Exactly what I wanted! It fits perfectly and I would recommend for anyone who may have a bit of a stomach, hides nicely. Very flattering and well made. I ordered another one in a different color.


The dress is super cute!! The material is so soft. I may wear it on Easter!


Love it!!  And so very comfortable.  The color tone is awesome.
