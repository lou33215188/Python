It was very tight through the shoulders and the fabric is very cheap and will stain terribly.


quite nice. good fit.  Hoping it's color-fast in the wash.


This is my first tshirt dress that I've ever actually liked!


Love this, very cool and floaty...

Very cute. I'm 5' 109lbs and the xs was perfect.


Super cute dress for my daughter!  Nice, thicker material!


Was a little shorter then I expected, but still really cute!


I like it but to small.  I ordered the biggest size which I should fit in normally
