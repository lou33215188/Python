Nice


the neck is different than I expected but it works as a beach cover up


Poor quality


Nice fit, pleased with this purchase.  Super cute.  Can be worn as dress or swimsuit cover up.  Highly recommended to others.


a little short but comfy


Would give 5 stars if it was a little longer. Super cute, and stylish, soft. Just short.


I'm 5'4, 115 pounds and ordered an XS.


The dress is still a tid to big but i believe it is the style of the dress. The material is super thick and not so comfortable. I'm hoping washing it will fix both of those issues.


so cute.


Fit is great for me, very soft material, and I would purchase this item again. I have received many compliments wearing this.


Great quality, fit perfectly. I am 5'3", 125lb and the small was just the right fit for a t-shirt dress. It looks super cute with a thin belt!
