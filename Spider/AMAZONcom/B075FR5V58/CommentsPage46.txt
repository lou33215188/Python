Cute dress but I'm not sure it'll last past a couple machine washes so use gentle cycle and air dry.


This is so cute! I put it on and it's a little larger than I anticipated. I usually wear medium tops/dresses (5'5", 140lbs, 38" chest). I think it'll be better if I wash it/dry in the dryer. Time will tell :) Still super cute and I'm very pleased.


Its ok but not what i was expecting.  It's tight in the bust and a little longer that I thought.  The material is hard like denim.


Too short, torso too wide/arms too skinny


This dress is soft and fits great! I ordered a 3XL, I'm not sure if thats what I got as it has no tag or markings but it fits perfectly!


I ordered 3x so I would have plenty of room to wear over my bathing suit.  It was so short and I wondered if it was a child's size.  Sent it back


This is a pretty cute top, but the sleeves are too small for it to be comfortable in the summer heat. I even ordered 2 sizes larger.


Fits as expected. Looks just like the pictures, the colors are beautiful.


Material was thin and way too small. I gave it to a friend.


I normally wear a 14/16, so I ordered an XL. The sleeves were skin tight. The rest of the shirt fit ok, but I couldn't get past the sleeves.
