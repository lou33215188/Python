Shirt not dress. I am 5'5. Cheap polyester looking top.


Nice - Thank you!


It had a hole in it.  I didn't see it before I washed it.


Rather nice and easy to wear. Doesn't wrinkle too much


As reviewed recently, I and others liked my dress. The material and the fit were perfectly. Then I ordered this one and it was some shorter and some smaller.


I received SO many compliments on this dress. Love it!


I love the color.  They didn't have it in large, so the Medium is just a little tighter than I would prefer, but it's okay.


Love it3!!! Cute


I really love this dress! I got it to wear to a major music festival and with the ombr√© colors it was perfect hipster styling! Very cute, flattering and comfortable - even in the 105 degree heat!


Arrived quickly, sits well. I get compliments each time I wear it.
