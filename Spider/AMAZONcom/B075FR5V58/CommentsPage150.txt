Love this dress! So cute!


I didn't have very high hopes for a such a cheap dress, but I decided to take the plunge.  If it didn't work out, it was only $15, no biggie.  It turns out, I was wrong about my hesitations.  This is a great dress and is true to size.  I got compliments on it the first time I wore it.  The material is much nicer than I expected for the price.  It's heavier jersey, has a great stretch to it, and doesn't wrinkle easily which is what I love about it.  Because the fabric is heavier it hangs very well.  I even wore it on a very windy day and didn't have to walk around with my arms glued to my side paranoid that it would fly up.  It stayed put.  I've machine washed and line dried it and it still looks great.  I'm definitely going to get a second one in a different color.
