A little too small fit in the arms. But my daughter wore it well. She Loves the style and the color.


I'm 5'2 and it fits perfect. Light and comfortable fabric.


I should have gone up one size, but this fits fine - just not as lose as I like. Fabric is really nice and not cheap, colors are beautiful! I know this will be something I throw on in the summer.


Love the size, fit and feel of this dress or tunic. It would be a perfect night gown too.


Fits perfectly. Wish it was a little bit longer, but that is just my style.  I really like the color and the way it drapes. Very comfortable.


I liked it until I washed it. Now its waaayyy too small


Very Nice fabric. After reading reviews, I bought an XL.  I am a 14-16 with a 36G bust.  Top was too small.


More of a dress than tunic. Returning for XL.


Great fabric but neckline is more t-shirt style than I expected. Look great with jeans!


Super super short. Like, awkwardly short. Can get away using it as a sleep shirt but definitely not in public.


love it for camping, beach etc.  too full for regular wear at say supermarket but all the tweens and teens camping liked my ombre
