The fabric is a very nice weight.  The colors are gorgeous.  The dress is comfortable and has a nice amount of stretch.


Super cute and almost too big everywhere, except the arms which are very tight. If chunky arms are an issue I'd recommend ordering one size up. Otherwise, this dress is really cute and comfortable.


I ordered a large based on the size guide because I wanted it to be a bit bigger than I wear. I was going to use it for an around the house dress. It is of good quality, color and material are very good.


I will likely give to my sister.


Really cute!! I can wear it but it's right across the bust.


Other comments said this material wS super soft. I have to disagree, it feels like a starched soccer jersey and is WAY shorter than expected. I'm 5'4 and a 36 DD so maybe it's the boob room but I would not wear this in public. I was hoping for a fun sundress but I'm keeping it as a beach cover up. I would literally never wear it in any other capacity because i would be mooning everyone around me.


Gave 3 stars cause its cute and great length. I bought a large, I typically wear a Medium, but I need to return it for a larger size. Small in the arm pit and chest area and by no means am I large chested.  ; )


Cute dress, but the top is very narrow compared to the bottom half.


This is just a long oversized tshirt...  I felt so frumpy when trying it on.  Maybe for a nightshirt or a beach coverup but there is no shape to it... a long tshirt isn't a dress


Cute but way to small for the size ordered the xxl


this dress looks good on everyone.  it's insane.  the fit and color are super flattering.  I went home the other weekend and my best friend wore it (size 4), my mom (size 8) and myself (size 6) and we all looked amaze and got a lot of compliments
