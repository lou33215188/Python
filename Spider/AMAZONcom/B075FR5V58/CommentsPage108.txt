I like the color and the material is very comfy and cool but the arms are a little snug and it could be a Couple inches longer.  I will wear with capris and leggings.


Super cute nice thick material made well


Will be cute with grey or navy leggings.  Cute for weekend wear.


Cute, would recommend
