Super cute, looks great with sandals or sneakers


I love this dress! Fits great and loose! This is my first time purchasing apparel on Amazon and I'm so impressed! I'm 5'4" and around 145/150 lbs. with DDcup size and bought a medium. Fits super well!


Cute, comfortable, easy.  Fits true to size.


Looks nice (as pictured) and is comfortable. Dresses up nicely with a long necklace.


Around neck was too tight not like the picture shown.


Cute, cute!  Ordered according to size chart, a medium and that's what I normally wear.  It looks just like how it's pictured.


GREAT dress and AWESOME price!!!


Wow, this dress is deeeefinitely not for my body type, it looked ridiculous on me!  I have broad shoulders and 36C chest and it hung super unflattering... too tight across the shoulders and chest and shapeless and baggy from the waist down. I ordered a Medium.  Maybe if you are small on top it would fit better?  The material is good quality, stretchy and thicker than I anticipated and I liked the color, the picture is accurate with the green maybe a hair darker in real life.  The picture makes it look like a boat neck but it is not, it is a t-shirt neck.  Yeah, I think this is for someone small on top with smaller shoulders, then maybe, but definitely not me!


cute, and the fabric quality is good, especially for the price


Really cute design, but cut very small and the material is too clingy.
