This dress is perfect!! It's great for warm weather and now that it's cooler outside, I can pair it up with a scarf and boots and it still is super cute. Definitely recommend this dress!


It seems a bit small, especially on top. I'm 5'8" and it fit more like a tunic than a dress and needs leggings or trousers underneath. It does look as pictured.


This green/blue ombre t-shirt dress is a really cute alternative to t-shirt and sweats. I love it! I'm about 5'2" 110lbs and an x-small fit perfectly. It fits loose and very comfy but doesn't look like a shapeless sack hits mid-thigh (not too short).


Lighter material than we would prefer, slightly translucent. Dye is excellent, fit is perfect. It's very cute, I just wonder how long it will hold up to regular wear.


I love it. I'm 5'6" and I got an XL and weight 180. It fit perfectly.. it hugged all the right places.


After several times wearing it and wash it. The color still stay vibrate. It definitely a beautiful summer dress.


Very cheap, no stretch, and super short. I'm only 5'2" and it barely covered my back side. It was also very tight, and I bought a size up.


Very cute dress! Sleeves were tight on arms but material gives so not too bad. Overall loved it!


I ordered my normal dress size (18/20) which seemed appropriate based on the sizing chart but the dress is more snug than I'd like. Pretty fabric, soft/cotton, will be nice for the beach.


I love these two dresses and am so glad I bought them! They are so comfortable and perfect for hot summer weather!


I typically wear a size 2x so I thought it safe to buy the 4x.  Not even close to fitting.  Arms were super tight and the "dress" was way too short.  Color is true to the picture.
