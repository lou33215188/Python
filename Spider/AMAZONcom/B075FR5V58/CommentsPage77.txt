I normally wear a 16 W and I ordered the 3X and it still is too small! Not even close so going back


I had to return this - the material wasn't very nice and it was too short for me (I am 5'9"). The colors were nice though!


Fits well but short, better as a bathing suit cover up than a dress, I’m 5’10


Very cute and comfortable dress.


Comfortable, nice fabric "feel".


Very cute dress.  Fits well.


Nice fit and fabric, perfect length to wear as a tunic. I guess if I were younger I would wear it as a dress, but alas I am not.  I really love it as a tunic.


Got the blue dress and I like everything about it, except it's a little short. I wear it as a long shirt with leggings or wear shorts underneath.


Too small. Figured an XXXL would fit, but in the world of ladies fashion, XXXL is more the juniors plus size, & not women's plus size. Returned. Too bad.


Nice fit nice color nice material, love it.
