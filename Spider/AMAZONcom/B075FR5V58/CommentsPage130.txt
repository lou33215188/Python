love the color and fit.


Perfect fit, very comfortable. Can dress up or casual!


Cute comfy dress but I'm going to have to take in the bottom side seams


The fabric wasn't as nice of a material as I expected


Love this dress! Cute and comfy, I put a pair of shorts underneath.


I’m 5’6 and this dress is short for me.


Love love love this


The sizing was way off. Ran extremely small.


The dress is cute. Just smaller in the chest than most. So had to send it back


Had a strong chemical smell when arrived so make sure to wash it before wearing it
