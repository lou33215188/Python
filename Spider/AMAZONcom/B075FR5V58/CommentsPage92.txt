Love this dress! Great material and good quality. I got compliments all day. Veru comfortable! I'm a a bigger chested, 5'2" medium build. The for was great and flattering. Everyone commented on the unique color. A very good buy, highly recommended.


I  love this little dress....I ordered one size up and it fits perfectly. Material is very soft and comfortable as well.


Cute dress for a great price. I concur that the fabric does not feel cheap and it is super comfotable!


This dress fit too awkwardly on me and I returned it. The color and the fabric are very nice. It just fit me strange.


Super comfy and i love it! The neckline is a little higher than the picture.


Loved the look,but sized too small in the bust...  sadly, had to return it.


Looks exactly like the picture and fit well. I am 5'3 135 pounds and a medium was good for me.


A great little dress.


The material was nice, super soft. The color was great, however the 3x fit like an extra large.


I think the look is very cute but it was just too small for me. Very sad :( The material also felt cheap.
