A little tight in the arms; if you like that, get your size, if not, go up one size.


Comfy and can dress up as well as keep casual


So cute! Perfect t-shirt dress


Tighter than I expected through the shoulders and chest


GOOD!


Very comfy. Super soft. Of great quality.


Even though I ordered the tunic a size larger than I normally wear, the tunic is a little tight in the shoulder's.


I absolutely love this dress!! I purchased one for myself and one for my daughter. Great price for this dress!!!


the green is darker than I expected it to be; more Army green, which is not the best color for my skin, but otherwise it is fine


Looks good, decent quality, shipped fast
