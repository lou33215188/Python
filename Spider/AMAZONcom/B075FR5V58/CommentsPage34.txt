Good sizing except for the sleeves. The sleeves were made for Barbie. I plan to cut them open & wear it for sleep.


The color is just as expected. Will look great with leggings.  The fabric is soft and has just the right amount of stretch!  I bought a large because of what previous buyers said and because it's made with cotton. Glad I did because it hangs to my knees so I can also wear as a dress.


Somewhat small thru chest but flares good to fit waist and hips. Hope it hasn't shrunk too much. Am traveling so we will seeğŸ¤“


I'm 5'4, 150 pds and 36 Cup. I ordered a Medium based on the reviews and it fits perfect.  I normally wear a large in tops for my chest size, but the medium fits well. Since it's a flowing dress I didn't want to go too large to add extra pounds. The material is soft and quite nice considering the price. It feels great on these hot summer days and you can dress it up as well. I will definitely order in more colors. You cannot go wrong with this dress for the price.


Love this dress! The fabric is a little thick, so I soaked it in saltwater for a few days to make it softer. Color is beautiful, too. Highly recommend!


This dress is really short. If you are 6 feet tall, this dress looks like a long shirt. other wise cute dress.


Love Love Love this dress! I never wear dresses but needed something easy to wear with my knee immobilizer while on vacation. This dress is really comfortable and cute.


Lovely color and the fabric feels great! Can dress up or down. Looks more expensive than what was paid for it. I washed it on gentle and air dried so as not to take the chance that it would shrink, since it fit perfectly out of the box.


Comfortable, cute tunic. It looks great with a pair of jeans or leggings and also works well on its own with a pair of boots.


Buy this dress, buy it now! It's so cute!! Great material, does not run small, it looks exactly like the picture shows!
