My wife liked it


See through.


The color is beautiful and the fabric is very soft.


This dress is so comfortable and looks great.


ARMS WERE WAY TOO TIGHT.


Love dress but XL and XXL too small!


Order 2 sizes up. I do love the colors!


Loved the fit and color


Soft material, great fit, and its perfect length!!!


It is a nice light summer dress.  Being cotton, I expect it to wear well.
