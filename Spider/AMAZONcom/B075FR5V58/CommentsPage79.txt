I ADORE this dress, but I am 5'9 and it is not made for women my height. Works great as a tunic, though. Love the fabric, love the color, everything but the length.


Good fit, great price, comfortable wear. Looks great as a tunic with leggings.


I love it but it looks terrible on me!


nice shirt.  well made.


Really like this dress, super casual and fun to wear.


I love the color and it isn't super thin, which I enjoy. It is too short for me to wear as dress though, so I have to wear leggings with it.


I really love this! Good quality stretchy fabric! Super comfy


it is ok but small


fits exactly as you would expect. SO COMFY!!


5 stars but it is a very short dress. The material is thicker than I thought it would be. But glad that it's not thin or see through. It was kind of tight on my arms.
