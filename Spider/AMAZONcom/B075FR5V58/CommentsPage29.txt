I really like this dress. Looks great and will be amazing for my trip to the Bahamas. Only con is it’s short in the back so if I bend over I show the world my cookies. I am a tall girl though. I’m 5’7 169 and bought the large. I normally wear men top and 10/12 pants


Comfy, cute dress for summer. Perfect for hot weather, not clingy at all. I ordered a large and I'm 5'7 165 lbs. it's a little short but otherwise a great fit.


I am a size 14P and this looked adorable on.  Probably the most flattering t-shirt dress I have owned. Colors are great, fabric is a nice quality.  I am 5ft and this is right above my knee.  So, the length is good also.


Only gave 1 star because I had to. Normally wear 3X ordered 5X because I wanted it to be loose and flowing.  It's WAY too small. Tag says 5X but probably more like 2X.


every time I wear this I get compliments.  And so surprising for such an inexpensive little dress!  Fabric is really nice, fits great and it very comfortable!


A nice tunic but too small.


Wanted to love this but with DD breasts and this dress not being fitted, it made me look like a box in the front with no figure. Love the material and color! Just not my body type.


I’m 5’1 and this was a little long to wear with leggings, but perfect length to wear without them. Hits right above my knees. I plan to wear it with a belt to give me a little more shape in it. Only 4 stars because the quality is SLIGHTLY cheap, but still pretty decent!


I love this!!!! I ordered the XXL and I'm a 16/18. I'm 5ft 1in and the length is about 1 inch above my knee. Perfect for me but if you have long legs, you may need to wear leggings under.


Cant wait to wear this summer


Fun to wear.  Great color.  Easy wash and wear.  Wore it at home as is and threw on a pair of jeans to run errands.  Comfortable and cute!
