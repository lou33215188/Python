This is a great quality simple cute dress for the price. I'm between 135-140 lbs almost 5'4 and got a medium...fits perfect. It's a little short but I like short dresses. Can be dressed up or down. Not sure how it will wash and dry. A major brand would charge over $50 for this dress, the ombre color is trendy.


This is the second set of dresses I purchased and am amazed at how nice they are.  Especially considering the low price


Love the material and colors, a little short for me I'm 5"5 and about 140 and it's too short to wear without shorts underneath but the top fits great I got a size large. I think the medium would have been too tight up top.


Love this dress!!! The quality is GREAT for the price. I got a medium and I was afraid it would be too short, but it was the perfect length (Iâ€™m 5â€™7 for reference). Iâ€™m so happy with this purchase.


Quiet possibly my.new fav dress!! So comfy. I'm 5'1 and it reaches right above my knees. So perfect for summer!


Cute and comfortable for summer.  I wear over leggings I found in the same color.


Not for tall gals - could see all my secrets if I raised my arms (im 6'0)


A little shorter than expected. It rides up very easily but it looks as pictured. It is very soft and comfortable to wear!


I am 5'9" and this was way too long on me - came down to my knees


VERY SHORT for an XL. barely covers my behind
