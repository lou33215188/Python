Love it,  fits perfect, looks even better in person,  true to size


Color is not the same as the picture.  The blue shade was more like the color in the mid section.  Was  disappointed I order these one because of the cute shading. But nowhere near close.


Immediately returned this. I got a small and it still looked like a big bag. Maybe it's just not for my body type.


Love the whole idea behind this dress. But reordering going up two additional sizes. I read all posts but couldn't handle budges. 42dd weight under 200. Trying 5x. Can't handle restrictions,


Have to be comfortable and the girls hated confinement with a 3x(usually wear 1x)


Ps I can sew so will adjust accordingly


This is one of my favorite dresses of all time! I've gotten countless compliments. I bought this for a trip to Europe as something that can be thrown on and walked around town or to & form the beach. Served its purpose and is still a fave!!


I absolutely love this dress! I am 5'3 and 220 lbs. I have a big bust and the dress still fits nice and is not too short in the front. Highly recommend this dress! Love it!


Too big for a small but I Still keeping them.


Cut extremely small fits like a t shirt


Fitted well and looks casual and comfortable
