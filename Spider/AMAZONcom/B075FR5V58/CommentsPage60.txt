Odd fit - tight across bust and shoulders then very wide at hips - gave a pear shape look.  Sent back


So short, short enough to be a t-shirt.


Love the dress but it runs a bit small length-wise. Otherwise I'm very happy with it


I have received several compliments on this dress. The colors are beautiful. It fits as expected.


Super cute dress. TTS but is a little short. I received tons of compliments when I wore it!


Love this dress!!! I want every color!!! I received so many complements.


the sleeves are way too tight; I can barely get my arms through them and feel like my circulation is being cut off


Soft, comfortable, and cute.


When I read reviews it said that it team somewhat small, so I ordered a size up and it fit perfectly. Like it very much


I'm 5'6 135lbs I ordered a medium and it fits the way it looks in the picture. The material is thicker than I expected and I like it, very comfortable. The dress is short like if I bend you can see my spandex underneath so just keep that in mind when ordering sizes.
