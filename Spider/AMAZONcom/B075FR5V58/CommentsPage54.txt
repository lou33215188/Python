I was really excited about this dress but it's too short, I could see it working well as a baithing suit cover up but not for a going out dress. At least not with my thunder thighs, lol


It fit great and its form fitting. Loved it!!


It's fine for the most part. I usually wear a large, but I ordered an X-Large just in case, and it's pretty tight on the arms. Everywhere else is okay fitting. I mostly just got it so I could wear it to work with leggings so I'm not that worried about it.


This shift is made of lovely, apparently high quality fabric but it is extremely small.


Cute design but the fabric is disappointing, stiff and a little too thick to lay well. Wrinkles really set in too.


Shapeless. This would be good for someone with no curves.


Excellent casual dress. I ordered XS for this  swing dress whch fit my 5'2" 110 lb. frame well.


Love the ombre. Only draw back...would have loved more options in the same ombre pattern in dfferent colors.  Get this dress!


I love this. It looks exactly like the photo, and the material is a great thick quality. Would buy again


Great simple t-shirt dress. The fabric is a bit thicker and not as soft as I prefer. Can get wrinkly. Color is just as pictured. Overall very cute!


5'2"  120 lbs  ordered a small


I bought this to wear on vacation over my bathing suit but it is so soft and comfy that I will be using it as a night shirt instead. It is perfect for lounging around the house and sleeping.
