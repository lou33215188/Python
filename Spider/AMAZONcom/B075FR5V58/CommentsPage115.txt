I will probably make this a beach dress.  The fabric is a little thicker than I expected and in general it is a little larger in all areas than i would've liked.


Nice fabric, looks better than the photo.


The sleeves are extremely small & the dress is about 1 size too small even though I sized up when purchasing.


I am 5'2 and 154 lbs.  I ordered a size large and it fit perfect!  Very comfortable and stylish.  Material was better quality than I expected for this price.


Very soft, good quality for price.


Super cute, fits great, I love the colors & the fabric is nice.


Love this dress, it's a bit shorter than anticipated but not bad. It's comfy, cute and tailored nicely. Simple and casual


I love this dress! I'm 5'2" and 170lbs and got a large. It fits perfectly. I will be buying more!


Nice color and material but too short on me. Will be returning


I LOVE this dress! It is SO flowy, so comfortable, and very cute!
