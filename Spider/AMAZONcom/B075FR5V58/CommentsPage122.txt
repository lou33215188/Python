I love this dress.  However, 3X to the manufacturer is a bit of a misnomer.  I ordered 3X because I thought it would be loose on my not so thin body.  The dress arrived yesterday.  I removed it from the box.  It looked small but I tried it on.  The sleeve felt like a blood pressure cuff on my arm.  The dress was a tight as a sausage casing...a lumpy sausage.  Actually, I looked kind of like a poorly made piÃ±ata.


I would like to return the dress but I don't have a computer.  That is the worst thing about shopping Amazon.  No receipt with the purchase and no return information.  Hell, I would make my own return label if I just knew were to send the dress.


Maybe I'll buy another one, cut it down the middle and piece the left and right sides together to make a larger dress.  Nah, I can't do that.  I just ordered a wheelchair for use after my upcoming ankle surgery.  I wouldn't need the surgery but I put weight on the ankle when I was told not to and the bone shifted.  I hate fat me.


Fits everywhere but the bust. Even got the next size. The material is great though.


Super cute and very versatile !!!


Love it very much! Beautiful fit and beautiful colors!!


Kind of short. Good for leggings or people younger than me, lol.


I'm a size 14/16 so I ordered the XL. I was so excited when I received it only to find that it felt tight in the chest and arms. I reordered in XXL and it fits much better. Super comfortable and easy to wear. I wore it to work and received many compliments. The best thing of all is that I felt like I had worn pajamas to work. This dress is truly that comfortable  don't let the price fool you it is definitely worth every penny. ğŸ‘—


Y'all I don't typically leave reviews but this dress is amazing. It is super soft, and I have already told my husband I am ordering one in every color.


Love this dress. It is very comfortable, easy to dress up or wear casually, and I've gotten complements on it each time I've worn it.


I love the fit I'm 5'3 and wear a 34DDD, I'm about 146 pounds, usually wears a medium to large in shirts and the medium in the dress ğŸ‘— fits great


I love this dress! So comfy.
