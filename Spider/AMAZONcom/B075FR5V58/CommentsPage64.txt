Pretty dress, but has small sleeves. I'll still wear it


Top was too tight,did not look like the photo. I gave it to a young lady with narrow shoulders and it worked for her.I wanted something loose fitting in the top and bottom. This dress did not fill that bill.


PERF for summer comfort - Iâ€™d wear it every day if I could!


Runs slightly big! Typically wear a size 6 I'm 5'4 and the medium has some extra fabric but still fits really cute! Super light weight and comfy but not see thru :)


Buy a size down.  The ombre pattern is actually pretty good for the price but the fit is very baggy.


Didn't like the heavier cotton. Not light and swingy.


I love this dress. The cotton is not too thin and not too thick. I'm 5 foot 5 and busty and bought a large and it's fits perfectly. It falls about 3 inches above the knee.  I love it!!


I love these dresses!  I ordered the teal one first and then loved it so much i went back and ordered three more in different colors!  Great material, fits perfect!  Im 4 ft 11 and weigh abt 170.  These r not too short and not too fitting around the waist/stomach area.  Love love love!!!


The dress is cute but it is very clingy and am awful fit for me unfortunately. I had twins 3 weeks ago so my belly is still a little round and this is so clingy. I wonder if I got sent the incorrect size? Very disapointed!


The dress is comfortable but the sizing is a bit smaller than I expected.
