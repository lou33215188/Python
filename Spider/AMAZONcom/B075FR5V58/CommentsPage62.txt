Nice loose fit, Good quality material, color as expected.  I like it..


Short but cute.


It says it is a size 3X but it is more like a size 10. Way too small.


Comfy and cute - I paired it with jeans bc I do not have that models legs - but it is cute and I received many compliments


Really great quality for a low price. Fits loose. I'm 5'1 and I got the xsmall which fit well.


Easy cover-up.


I really wanted to like this but it fit me strange, the top part was super tight and the bottom part just hung weird.


I am very pleased with the quality and fit of the garment!


One of my favorite summer dresses.


No way this is an American 3x. Cute dress though. Wish it worked for me.
