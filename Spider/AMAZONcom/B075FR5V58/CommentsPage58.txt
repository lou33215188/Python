It's Pretty.. It looks good for a day at the beach or maybe for running errands. Nothing fancy..


I don't buy clothes online very often because of my body type, but this dress fit perfectly! I love it so much and it's so comfortable!! I wear it all of the time! I got my usual size and it fit as expected.


Love the feel and fit of this.  I'm shorter so it fits exactly at the length I want!  I'm also heavier than normal, but this dress is very forgiving.  Wish they had more colors in my size, I'd buy the whole lot of them!!


Super cute and comfortable and has held up through multiple washes. I'd definitely recommend sizing up though, maybe even 2 sizes.


Very cute and comfortable the fabric is great quality.


Nice material and style but way too short even in my 5'2" daughter


Looks good, nice quality.


This fits great! I'm 5'1, ordered an XS and this the same length as pictures. I've even washed it and it hasn't shrunk. Taller girls should probably size up.


Fabric is stretchy, feels comfy when I tried it on.  Haven't washed it yet, but so far it is just what I wanted!


I love this dress and can't wait until it's warmer so I can wear it. Very cute and flattering! The colors are more muted than in the picture, but still very pretty! Fits about 2 inches above my knees and I am 5'3.
