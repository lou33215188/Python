I liked the color of this dress, but I did not like the fabric. It wasn't as soft as I was expecting. I bought it mostly as lounge wear, so I'll be sending it back and search for something softer.


Very nice fabric, great fit and length, cute colors!


Cute, but I'm 5'6" and it was way too short on me.


Adorable dress. Order a size up because it shrinks a bit when you wash it. I'm usually a small, but this was a tad too short for my comfort level (I'm 5' 3"). The medium is perfect - slightly longer and fits similarly in the top.


I am going to live in this dress this summer.  Though maybe I'll order more for a little variety (:


More of a shirt I'm 5'7 and it needs to be worn as a longer shirt


Easy and comfortable. Kitchy.


Very pleased with style and fit


Love love! Cute, comfy, well made, great price. I don’t like super short dresses and I’m 5’10”, but it’s for an anniversary beach trip so it won’t bother me for that purpose. Slightly short but really is perfect!


Super cute. Good quality. Perfect length for a 5"4" lady
