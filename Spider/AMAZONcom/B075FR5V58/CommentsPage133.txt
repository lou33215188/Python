I wear an XL and ordered XXL.  Fit like a large.


Very comfortable and fun dress.


cute, bigger than i expected.


I'm 5'10" and it fits me like a tshirt. But it's soft and cozy...better to sleep in....


Fits amazingly, I'm 5'9 and the dress is not short on me, which was one of my concerns when I bought the dress.


Perfect length, soft material.  I love it!


Super cute.  I wear it with leggings because it is short.


The colors are great but the size runs really small.  Not what expected.


Fits perfect!!


It's okay for the price.
