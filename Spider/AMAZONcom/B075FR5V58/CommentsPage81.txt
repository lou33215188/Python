I love the style and fabric, but it's real tight in the arms and chest !!


Tight in bust and arms.


I expected this to be on the short side because I'm 5'9". After washing and drying it once, it shrunk so much that I cannot wear it as a dress. Also, it came wig some major defects in the fabric that look like stains.


I love the fit of this sundress, and the colors are so pretty. I plan to get a few others!


Beach cover up---or walk the dogs.  It works and doesn't offend anyone.


Cute, but quite short (I'm 5'9") and came with a hole in the seam of the armpit. The material is nice though.


I wear a size 12/13 pants.  Large top. 5'7.  Little bit short but not unwearable. Very comfy material and will be perfect for my trip to the Caribbean this weekend.


Cute but VERY small.


I wanted a simple, cute dress and this is exactly that. Very happy.


Good summer maternity wear.  Will be able to wear it when I'm not pregnant too.
