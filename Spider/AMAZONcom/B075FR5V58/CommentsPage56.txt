A bit short for my taste, but very cute & comfortable.


its big on the sides, but its cute


bulky, large, and not flattering


SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN SIZE AND THE COLORS ARE NOT AS DISTINCT AS I'D HOPED


This seemed to be at least 2-3 sizes too small. Order up, ladies, or it will not fit.


This is a great casual dress. Love the fabric and the pattern.


This is so comfy! The fabric is insanely soft, and the dress is flattering to every body type. So cute, I want one in a different color


Very comfortable.  I normally wear a 7 in jeans and a medium in shirts.  I got a medium and it fit great.


True to size, cute color, flattering shape. I got sunscreen on it which stained it, so I'll have to buy another one! It makes a great swimsuit cover up!


So cute. Colors are very pretty. 5'3" and the length is perfect right about the knee.
