Dress was a little small but not unwearable.  I love the colors.


very cute! fits well and is flattering


Ran large, was very shapeless and I felt like I was wearing a maternity dress, so I returned it. I loved the colors though.


This was a gift for my daughter, got the small, she is 5' 2" and it fits perfect! I'm thinking I might need to get one for myself.


Pretty dress. However, I normally wear a medium and that's what I ordered and it is too big.


Love the comfort of this t shirt dress and the color! Arms and bodice were a little snug but its t shirt material and stretchy!


This is not a true size, I'm usually a 1x and decided to order 3x as I want to use it as a swimsuit cover up and wanted a loose fit, dress appears to b a standard jr large, not even close to 1x and I ordered 3x


The chart given for sizes does not match normal American sizes. sent it back. too bad. the coloring was nice.


Its cute,not very stretchy so you have to order a size bigger.


At first I thought itâ€™s too big for me, but then it just depends on how you carry the dress. It looks pretty and I like the matcha color of it
