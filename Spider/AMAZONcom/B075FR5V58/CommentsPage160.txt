Great color, comfortable, fits well. Good value for the price.


Fits perfectly. Love the material and color. 5'4 165lbs


200# and 5' ... fits perfect. Hit's above the knee and feels nice


Top is too tight, sleeves are very tight.


Too toght


Slightly small and short.


wasted money for a top I would have loved had it fit as advertised.


Very short, but beautiful color.


Arms are a bit tight.


Totally NOT an accurate sizing.
