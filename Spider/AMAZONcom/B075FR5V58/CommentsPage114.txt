I loved this dress. It fits true to size and is very comfortable. I am 5'2 about 125 pounds and I ordered a small.


It fits now but won't once I wash it. Disappointed.


Really cute, nice weight fabric.  Washed nicely.  I would love to have it in black!


The tunic runs small. Loved the feel and the product, but not true to size.  Otherwise as expected.  Bright colors.


I like it.


Love it it's comfy


Perfect, comfortable & stylish!


Sleeves a lil small


Exactly what I was hoping for. Good quality and exactly like the pic. I ordered to wear as a dress with out legging. Length is perfect.


Soft material. Look and feel beautiful!!!


Love it
