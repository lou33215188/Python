I ordered an extra large, because after the reviews I read, they talked about sizing. Around my arms and chest, the dress is tight. But from right under my chest to the hem, it's loose. It's a weird fit, but I still like the dress. :)


I love this dress! I need it to come in more colors! I ordered a large and I'm a size 10 and it fit perfectly.


It's a really cute dress. I would recommend getting the size you normally wear, maybe a size smaller. This dress kind of 'fans out' at the bottom and makes it look big. I bought a medium expecting it to be tight but it's actually a little bit too big. Overall, nice buy!


Really cute dress. Fits small, stitching could be better.


Got compliments!


The size was actually okay, but this was WAY shorter than it said it would be. The measurements should have had it just above my knees.. I'm reality it didn't even cover my butt. What I was hoping would be a cute dress ended up being a pajama shirt. Disappointed


Meh. It's ok. Neckline is different from the picture and it's pretty large, glad I went with a small.


This dress is amazing.  Really nice fit.  Can wear it with flip flops or heels


Amazing dress, great ombre fade.  The dress is comfortable and loose.


It runs a little small, but it is very comfy and seems to be a good quality.


It was just that the material of the dress is not what i have expected
