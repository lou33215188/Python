Love the colors but this is NOT a dress!  I went up 2 sizes looking for a flowy effect and this "dress" comes mid butt.  No way could it be worn as a dress unless you are less than 5'....


Very comfy, not super short (a few inches above the knee on my 5'3" self), doesn't wrinkle terribly, and it's not super thin. I liked it enough to buy a second one in another color.


runs very small. Gave it to my teen daughter. She wears it like a tunic. I bought a Large thinking it would be roomy. Color was nice.


I love this tunic!  The fabric is very soft and strong.  The fit is wonderful (I am 5'2" and weight 125 pounds).  I use it as a top over pants, but it is definitely long enough to wear as a dress.


Very nice t- shirt type dress/top.


I ordered a medium  (size 10 dress) and it fits.


I can wear it as a short summer dress  or over tight crop pants.


The colors go well with jeans.


I read the previous reviews and ordered a larger size. It fits and I like the ombre color. I'm tall, so it's to short to use as a dress and kind of long for a shirt.


True to size, not baggy but doesn't cling which is nice. I like the material, would look good with sandals and a long necklace. Excited to wear it! Really nice dress being 3 months post partum for me... I feel it's flattering yet comfortable. A little tight up top around the arms if you're a little chesty but still looks good. I'm 5"3 and it wasn't too short or too long, perfect length.


This dress is just gorgeous!  It is so soft, and nice and cool.  Very comfortable, and the colors are amazing.  If you are considering purchasing one, DO IT!  I want one in every color! :)


I absolutely love the color combination!! It was light & comfortable, but a tad too tight in the chest area & all I did was stretched it a bit & it was great!!! I have one exactly like this one w/ spagetti ğŸ˜Œ straps & wear it more often as its more comfy for me!!!


color is wonderful.


Color did run in the washer.


Fabric is thin. Good stretch to the garment. I plan on wearing with leggings or just to lounge in here at the house.
