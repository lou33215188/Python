It's tight at the top and really large at the bottom. Cute, but not very flattering.


yeahh, it's cotton stuff, and it's fits me somehow, but if it's longer will be better. not bad, no regret buy this one


I am 5’9” the dress was a bit short, but extremely cute for a bathing suit cover-up


Fits perfectly and it is a very good material, 90% cotton and 10% elastin . Super comfy and the color is gorgeous! Beautiful summer/Sunday brunch dress.


Such a cute dress


This dress is super soft and doesn't feel cheap at all. The length is perfect for girls that are shorter.


I love this dress. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it, and it fits wonderfully. It's not too short, and not too long.


Looks like a tent.  Colors are horrible


Comfortable, soft cotton dress.  Can be very versatile with Summer and Fall. Just the right size. I wear an XL , 5'6' weighing 165 lbs.


Love this dress. So easy and fun
