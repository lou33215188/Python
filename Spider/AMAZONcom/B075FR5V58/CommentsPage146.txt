Loved it


It is pretty small across the shoulders/bust.


Don't like. It's tight in the top and flows out to the bottom. It doesn't look good on me but maybe it's because I'm short. Makes me look bigger then I am.


Love the dress, is a little shorter then I expected,  but love it


love the fabric.


Bought this for my daughter the fabric washed great and looks beautiful


It's a bit short, but cute


Still looks great


Is not that loosely.


True to size, great fabric
