Adorable dress and fits perfectly.


Runs a little big but nice with leggings


Wow. Just.. I love this dress. Makes me feel very confident. Curvy girl friendly, I ordered an XL and it was so flattering.


I love this dress.  Super comfy.  Only one flaw.  There is a small fade spot on it.  But I still love it.  Flowy, soft, cool, great for summer.


love it


Terrible....


Best t-shirt dress.  I loved my first one so much, I ordered 2 more in different colors.  I am 5'4", 155lbs and this dress is very flattering.  Did I mention that the material is fabulous too?


They sent me a scarf. A black scarf. It's an alright scarf, no complaints about it. Except that it's not an ombr√© t shirt dresss. Which is what I ordered. I even checked upon opening the package. I thought "Did I somehow read "dress" when it said "scarf"?!"  I didn't though. I ordered a dress. Not a scarf.


I guess mistakes happen and I could return it. Seems like a lot of effort for a 15 dollar t shirt dress though. I'll give 2 stars, because it's soft scarf.


Wasn't big enough like I ordered


This dress fits really weirdly if you have a larger chest. It flairs out from right under the chest, so I can really only wear it with a belt around my waist. Bummer because I was really hoping it would just be a plain shift dress.
