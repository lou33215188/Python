Too stretchy and way too tight across the chest.  Sleeves are too small as well and there is side bulging; nothing like a real T-shirt fit.  Nice color...  5'6" and 150 and ordered a large. Length was OK.  If I had a printer; I'd send it back.


Nice.  The color is exactly as pictured.  Looks cute with capri leggings.


Cute but I sweat right through it in the first 5 minutes


Nice fabric nice trip


Nice fabric nice fit


The material is weird, the dress I recieved had a light stain on it. The cut is cute.


This is nice, it has pretty colors and fits as expected.  It is not regular T-shirt material, but is smoother fabric with a tighter weave, and still nice and light.  I think it probably won't stretch out as fast as regular t-shirts do.


Really comfy and looks just like the picture, however I am 5'7", 155 lbs with a long torso and long legs so it's a little shorter than I expected. I'm still relatively young so it's fine for now but definitely shorter than my usual dresses. Looks exactly like the picture though it terms of color and is stretchy and comfortable.


For a 2x, this was really small


The color is really nice, but the arms and bust area are pretty small. I'm 5'1" and this dress was almost too short for me even wearing flats. Anyone taller than me might find it too short. I'd order a size up if I had to do it over again.


Returned it was huge
