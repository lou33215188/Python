I say that it was too small because I ordered it two sizes larger than I wear, anticipating this problem because of prior experiences with online clothing.


I love this dress. I would wear it every day. So much that I even hand wash It.  Can't wait until there are more


I am in love, love, love with this dress!!!  The fit is perfect and looks absolutely adorable!  It's my summer dress (if only summer would come!)


DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRYER. I got one good wear out of it and it shrunk to the size of a t shirt after I washed it and dried it on low heat.


Super comfortable dress - I am 5'5' and the dress hemline is just above the knee - perfect length...


Very tight across the chest. Any larger though and it would look to big. It's ok for the price. Not sure how it is going to be after washing.


Super cute dress. I have fairly large boobs, and was worried about looking super frumpy in this shift. Turned out super cute! Itâ€™s a great dress to continue wearing all summer long.


The dress was too short and I was going to use as a tunic. But the top is tight and the neckline way too high. I gave it to my 13 yr old. I really don't like the fit on her either. Oh well


I like the other colors better. This one was a little thin. You can see through it.


Very cute dress but runs kind of big. I ordered a medium and was swimming in it! Sadly I returned it but might order a small in the future. Liked the material though (not really a cotton- more of a poly blend).


Really cute, awesome color and fabric, but cut way too small thru the shoulders and bust.
