I like this little number very much.


Love! True to size. And falls perfectly! Complements the first day I wore it ğŸ¤—


I really love this dress. I got one for me and my mom. It's comfortable and pretty. However for me, it fit pretty true to size. Some reviews are saying it fits too big but I found it fits pretty true.


Love the dress!!


My daughter lived it. Fit great.


This is a very cute dress BUT it runs VERY small.  I wear a 3x.  Most the time I can wear a 2x.  I ordered a 3x but it fit like a xl.  Cute but too small.


Fits perfect and true to size. I love this dress it's great to just throw on or dress up. I will be wearing it a lot this summer.


This is my new favorite dress! I got a medium and am 5'4", about 140 lbs. It is super comfortable and I love how thick the material is. I'll probably air dry it though, because it feels like it could shrink. If things go sour when I wash it I'll update my review, but for now I am OBSESSED.


Currently wearing it with vans for a day out here she and it looks super cool, but I could also definitely wear this with heels and a blazer for date night!


Im 5â€™5 and the medium is too short - but that may be an age related issue.  â€˜â€˜This is a nice looking dress and great fabric


the neckline is a lot tighter than shown on the model. the sleeves are smaller as well. The material, thankfully, is VERY stretchy.


SO COMFORTABLE!!!  Love the fabric too--better than t-shirt. Got raving compliments!
