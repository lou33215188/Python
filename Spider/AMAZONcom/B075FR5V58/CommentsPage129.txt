Cute, but the arms are a little tight.  (Common problem for me.)  I wish I'd gone a size up, but I keeping it.


Too short


I like the dress but it is a bit snug and shorter than expected so I wear it with leggings overall I'm happy with it.


Fits as expected. Colors are duller than expected.


I love it thxağŸ˜�


It fit well, I ordered based on reviews. Fabric is good and thick, but stains easily and the stain I got won't come off


Love this dress! Fits exactly like I hoped it would is is great quality for the price!


Just the tiniest bit too short! Still love to just throw it on. Perfect casual dress.


I had really high hopes for this dress, but I didn't like the way it fit me.  The quality and fabric were really nice, but there is zero shape to this dress.  I don't think it's very flattering on curvy girls because, as we know all too well, once it hits the boob area it just cascades off into a tent shape. I have a big bust and a big booty, but my waist goes in, and if there's no shape to the dress, I look huge because the seam isn't taken in to show off my waist.  I probably could've paired with a belt, but I'm not crazy about that look and don't want to have to make the dress fit me the way it already should.  If you're into the incredibly flowy look, go for it!  However, I think this style is for smaller-busted, more petite women.


Great fabric, perfect fit perfect length, adorable on !
