Cute and comfortable. Haven't washed it yet.


So cute!!


Exactly what I was looking for. Fitted on top, shapeless on the bottom.


Material is way to thin and it is way to small.


Super comfortable & fits well


Love it! The color is really cool and fits as expected.


Snug at arms.


It's a bit tighter around the chest than what I expected, but all in all I love this one.  It goes great with jeans or shorts, and would be a great swimsuit cover up.  It's like a long t-shirt (and feels like that as well).  Not at all see through and good quality material.  I'm overall very happy with this purchase.


Very pretty a little small around the top.


Size was not consistent with normal size range.
