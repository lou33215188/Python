Too short. Uncomfortable.


I have fat arms so it was a little tight


really like it because so comfortable.......


Beautiful Summer dress. I love it!


I ordered a size XL. It was a tight fit across the bust and in the arms.


it was good


Purchased as a gift but didn't know it was Asian sizing, very small! Color was great but way to small!!  Will be returning!!


Teen Daughter loved the color and material


Just got it in the mail and it fits perfect. I got an XL just to be safe and glad I did. It is snug on the top and flares out a little on the bottom but overall I'm super happy with this purchase. I'm 5"2 and the dress hits right above the knee. ❤️❤️


Size  is smaller than US standard
