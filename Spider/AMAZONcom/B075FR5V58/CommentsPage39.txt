It's a cute dress, it fits as expected meaning it's not too small or too large it's just a bit short for me and I'm only 5'4.  I don't feel comfortable bending down in it so I wear cropped legging under.  Maybe it's just me, overall I thought it was cute.


A favorite casual t-shirt of mine on those days when I want to be kind of lazy...but not too slouchy looking. Material is nice - it's not the soft texture you would cuddle up to, but it's comfortable nonetheless and seems sturdy.


This is a very cute dress that I wore with leggings.  It fit as expected and washed well.


I was not impressed with this dress. I did not like the way it fit. The fabric was soft but looked like it might keep the wrinkles.


Great material, cute colors, but too short, as a rubenesque woman, you will need leggings.


I totally love this brand of dresses. They are comfortable, fit great, and are well made. I highly recommend if you are looking for casual comfortable.


I took a chance on this dress hoping that it wouldn't be too short.  I'm 5' 7" and it's just an inch or two too short for my liking.  It hangs more like a nightgown than a dress, but it's a nice think material and the color is adorable.  I haven't washed it yet, but I hope it holds up.


Took 2 stars off for the sizing which must be for children and not adults.  To say it's on the small side is a huge understatement.  Too bad because it is really cute.  I might give it to my tween-age niece...


It just doesn't look good in person....which saddens me as the picture is adorable.


I LOVE this dress! It's so comfortable. I ordered a large based on the recommendations, but I usually wear an extra large. An extra large probably would have been fine too, maybe a little less tight on the bust/back. I want to order this in like five more colors!
