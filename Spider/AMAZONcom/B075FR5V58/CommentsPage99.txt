Not for tall women. I am 6ft, I ordered an xxl it fit fine but waaaaay to short. Can not be worn. Cute though! I gave it to a short friend.


I love the tunic. It is easy to take care and lightweight cotton for the summer. You can dress it up and go out, or dress it down and enjoy that that it is cotton and  lightweight in the bot Bermuda Summer


The colors are nice. But it is too tight in the arms/chest and way too short to wear as a dress.


usually wear a large but ordered extra large just to be safe, dress was skin tight- had to return it.


love the dress and the fit was perfect


This dress is perfection! It is super soft and comfortable but looks nice enough to wear to work or a night out! There was a strong smell out of the package, but I love this dress!


Loved the dress in general but just wish it had more breast room.


Comfy dress; colors are quite dull, not even close to the colors on the picture.


This is a quality piece and the colors are beautiful but itâ€™s a bit snug especially in the arms.


I loved this dress and it fit everywhere, but it was too short. I'm going to order a larger size a see it it works better.
