It fits perfectly and I love it.


I wear a size 10/12 but because It was an Asian product, I ordered an x-large and it was still too small.  I will be returning it and not reordering.


I love this dress! So cute! I got many compliments on it!


Cute, colors seem correct. Very very short


Cute comfortable garment. Too short to wear as a dress so I'll use t as a tunic instead..


Like it very much


Perfect summer lounge dress!


Great dress to just throw on! Flattering for all body types!


Love this dress! Exactly as pictured. Can't wait to wear it this summer!


I will use this product often. Love the color, fit, comfort and everything about it. Can dress it up or down.
