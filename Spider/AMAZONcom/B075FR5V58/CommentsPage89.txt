Came with stain on front.  Fabric smells weird


nice and soft


Too small in the shoulders.other than that I love it.


SO cute!  A ;little short but great summer time dress and cover up.


I like it. It is well made and the slightly flared shape works on me.


True to color and size. Washes well.


As a plus size woman it's so hard to find cute and comfy summer dresses. This was a god sent!!! Obsessed with it. Just wish it came in more colors for the ombr√©


It fanned out at the bottom way more than what the picture shows. Other than that, it fits, there is just way to much fabric :(  I still like it okay and will wear it around the house and while hanging on the deck.


I. Expected it to be softer and not so clingy....I sent back. Hope I get reimbursed.


It's very cute. The material is the kind where if you tug it it will show the pinching though, and it's a very short dress so don't buy if you're uncomfortable in shorter stuff. It was suppose to be a cute trendy dress to wear to work, but now it's a beach/pool cover up.
