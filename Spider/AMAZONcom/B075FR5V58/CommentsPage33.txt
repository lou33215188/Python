Love this dress! I ordered my size based on the size chart, and it fits perfectly! I love the length, and the color is exactly as pictured in the photo. For the price, it was a great buy!


Too tight on my arms, but I'm not returning. If I lose a few lbs I can wear it. Very loose in the waist. I may give to goodwill. Might look right on another body.


Really low maintenance, adorable summer dress. I wash cold and hang to dry, color and fit is still perfect. I'll be pairing it with legging and boots and sweaters in just a few short weeks!


The quality of this dress is better than I expected. I love the colors and how soft the fabric is. I did frond the top part and arms to be small and tighter than I would like. I usually wear a large in most tops, but I think and XL would have fit my chest and shoulders better.


Perfect fit.  Not too short as many dresses this style tend to be.  I am 5'7" and it comes to about 2" above the knee.  Fabric is soft and hangs well.  Don't dry.


I get a lot of compliments wearing this. I have it in the blue ombré and green ombré. They’re so comfy!


The dress itself is really cute, but cheaply made.  I am curvy and ordered a XXL.  It was the size of MAYBE a medium.  I should have looked at the size chart, but I assumed.  Good luck if you order this one :(


This is a beautiful dress. The arms were a little tight for me (my arms are 16" at the widest) but the rest fit perfectly.


Wife loves it.  Say's its soft and very comfortable


Loved it! But extremely small. Ordered a 3x and I do t hi k it would even be big enough for x-large, likely equal to a size medium. Disappointed, because I really liked it.
