This is what the it looks like straight out the package (no ironing). Nothing about this fabric looks or feels cheap. It's a lot nicer than I expected. Looks great on well endowed women. I'm 5'4, size 14 pant, 38G bra & ordered a large (I know, I was surprised it fit too lol) Perfect for a stroll on the boardwalk with my ladies or a laid back Summer lunch date.


I adore this dress! I am 5' 3" and 154 lbs. Most of my extra weight is in my mid section (welcome to middle age!) and I knew I didn't want it to cling to that area so I ordered an XL. It fits perfectly! It appears well made - nice stitching with no loose threads. Lightweight but not see through, it's perfect for running summer time errands.


Very cute dress. I'm 220, so I'm of course leery of online sizing. I ordered the 3X, since I'm 5'4, 42D. It fits fine. It isn't too short for me, as it hits right above my knee. It's a little snug up top but it's that material that you can stretch out yourself. It's a cute summer dress. I'm only knocking a star because it came damp for some reason, and the smell was awful. No clue what's up with that. I just washed it in cold water and lined dried and it's fine.


This material is very comfy and the dress is great! The length and fit are appropriate for the office (casual) - it wasn't form fitting or too short. I wear a size 10/12 and a large fit nicely.


I love itğŸ˜�


Love it! The colors are very soft and pretty. The stock photo is exactly what you get! Im 5'4", 175, 38DD and the large fit me just fine. I almost didn't get it because there isnt an XL available. I think the sleeves and chest area are the tightest,  but still not bad.


Very cute dress and fits well. Forgiving and stretchy dress. Fabric is t-shirt material but pretty thick. Ordered small and I'm 5'3" and 135 lbs.


I ordered this dress in a size small.  My measurements are 32B/26/38 and I am 117 pounds.  The fit is perfect for me.  I like the tie-dye effect, it makes this dress more interesting than just a plain t-shirt dress.  I m 5'2", and the length is perfect on me.  The fabric feels comfortable, but strong and durable, too.  I think it's going to hold up well for washing and wear.


Pretty but has holes in it ! Seams are not connecting with fabric !


What a great find! This is just a plain t-shirt dress and fits just like tshirt dress should. I was actually very surprised at how much I liked it in person. Love the ombre dye job. I ordered and XL (38 D & size 16 pant) and it fit great. I could have sized down, but I figured with washing it may shrink and I'd rather be safe an sorry. I have other t-shirt style dresses that I wear to work during the hot summer months and they are perfect. I've found that the material does stretch a bit while wearing. Highly recommend!
