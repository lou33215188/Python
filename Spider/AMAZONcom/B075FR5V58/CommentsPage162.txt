Love this dress! Fits perfectly and so comfy.


The sleeve are to tight..


I'm 5'2", 36 C, 41 hips and bought the medium. Fits beautifully. The material is higher quality than normal cotton tee. It has almost a silky feel to it. The colors are really vibrant. It's going to be so fun to wear this for the summer season!


Crazy shortb


Way too small.


Love this dress. Pretty much exactly as it appears in the photos, but I'd say it runs a little small for a supposedly loose fitting dress. If you're at all concerned about it being too tight I'd get a size up. For reference, I usually buy a size small-medium in shirts and dresses, I'm 5'9" and around 158lb. I bought a large because I wanted to make sure it was long and flowy enough and it fits perfectly. Will be wearing this all the time, super cute either alone or with leggings underneath.


Sleeves fit a bit snugg, otherwise the garment fits great. Very comfortable for lounging even on cool days.


So comfy, great colors just as shown! Love it.


Ugly! Nothing like the Picture.


I Love this dress, it's perfect, I ordered a large and I am 5"2 and weigh 170 pounds and it fits perfectly.
