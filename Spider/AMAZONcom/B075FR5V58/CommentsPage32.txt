It's ok.  But the neckline is a bit higher than it appears in this photo so it pretty much looks like I'm wearing a trashbag.  sigh  But perhaps you'll have better luck, are not 5'10" and weighing 140 pounds.  But I'll still plan to wear it to the pool.  (To the manufacturer.. neckline needs to be cut a bit lower! Just a bit...)


super soft and a nice fitted on top but not tight and hides my midsection nicely due to the ombre color. Bought size XXL i'm a size 14-16 most of my weight in my midsection


Flattering fit, especially with a postpartum belly. The fabric is decent quality and the color is attractive advertised in the product picture. Unfortunately did not hold up well beyond a few washes.


Really cute and comfortable, longer than a shirt but shorter than a dress.  Looks great with leggings!  Nice cotton fabric.


Love this ombre color. I ordered a large because I'm 28 weeks pregnant and I wanted enough room for my bump but able to wear it after the baby and its perfect


The dress is cute, comfy, and fit as expected. I love the teal and blue ombré effect. I was disappointed because the bottom seam had some tearing where the fabric is folded over, very cheaply made.


Very cute inexpensive dress that feels and looks expensive !!! Got compliments on first day wearing ... I’m ordering another one in a different color !!!


Love the color fade, but it's snug across the bust.  I ordered according to their size chart and went with largest size.  I'll keep it, but prefer a looser fit.


The material is very stretchy, almost like a thick swimsuit material. I will use it for a swimsuit cover-up. I would classify the one I bought  more as a long shirt than a dress.


It's great material.  It's cotton not that cheap thin material you'd expect.  It did come a little big.  I'm petite and got a small and it could definitely be smaller but none the less really cute.
