My teen daughter love this! Fits perfectly and so cute with a long necklace.


Just wore this simple and comfortable dress and got a few compliaments on it!! Win! Bought the blue one and it looks so pretty. Wore it with some white converse to dress it down. I am 5'1 and I'm 130 pounds. Fit perfectly. Has a flowy look which I love.


Great little T shirt dress. Soft fabric fits great. Actually a friend saw it and ordered two for herself.


so comfy and perfect length! These are such a good price! will def be getting more! super cute with summer sandals, and very forgiving even for those with some extra weight!


Very cute and comfy, has no tag though so which way is front and which way is back?


Go up 2 size maybe 3...


Super soft, color is cute..


The fabric is smooth and stretchy and does not seem very cotton-y, but it is very comfortable and fits well.  It's a great deal for the price.


Nice design as I expected but it's too big. I normally wear XS so ordered XS. It's like a size 2 or S although the label says XS.


I can still wear it but I look like Im wearing a men's tshirt :(


I received so many compliments on this dress the first time I wore it. It is a nice heavy weight fabric. I am 5'1 and the length is perfect. It is hard to find a t shirt dress that is the right length for petites. Most are too long. The ombre is very different and cool.


I absolutely love this dress! I wasn't sure what to expect because it was cheap, but when I received it I was very pleased. The material doesn't feel cheap, its thick and not see through.  I bought 4 different colors because it is so comfortable and I love wearing them!
