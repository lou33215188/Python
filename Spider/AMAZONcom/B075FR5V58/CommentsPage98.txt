I wear a medium in most clothing, but ordered a large after reading the reviews. The arms and chest arm are smaller than normal, but the large fit me great.


Quality was good, but it was way too small and I even ordered it a size larger:(


This dress is sooooooo comfortable!!


Color and size not as depicted. I returned it.


Cute; soft material, fits perfectly, and it is really comfortable.


I wore it with blue leggings and felt very cute :)


Order 2 sizes larger than what you normally order


It's a bit small in my chest for me (36DDD) but it fits great everywhere else! I can still wear it comfortably but it's a little snug!


Love it! Very comfortable!


The colors turned out better than expected. Fit is perfect, easy to wear  day and a few accessories and straight into night. Great summer dress!
