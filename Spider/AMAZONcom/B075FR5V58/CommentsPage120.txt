Cute.


I've gotten lots of compliments. My husband REALLY likes it.


I use it as a beach coverup. I do have to be careful when applying sunblock because it will spot; but it comes out easily with a quick little rinse with soap and water.


I'm 5'4" and it hits a couple inches above my knees - probably a little longer than the model in the picture, but not enough to look frumpy.


Some reviewers complain that it's too loose.  I think it's fine.  Whether you're fabulously toned or carrying a little extra, it flows nicely.


I ordered an extra size up and still to small even after following the recommendations.


Love it!


Comfortable and cute, fit as expected. I'm short, curvy, and well-endowed and it is a flattering cut with just enough stretch.I think I'll be wearing this one all summer!


LOVE LOVE LOVE


Very comfortable and pretty dress.


Super cute! Not too short (I am 5’11 with long legs). Material is a little stretchy, very comfortable.


IT’s a little wide at the bottom but I lole the material a lot!


Simple yet flattering. This dress is comfortable and I get lots of compliments whenever I wear it.


Love this t-shirt tunic.  One of my new favorites!
