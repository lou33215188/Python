Good Quality fabric but runs very small, get at least one size larger than usual.


Way too small. I wear XL, ordered a 3x and it is just too small to wear.


This item fits small through the bust.  I ordered accrding to size chart but after ordering twice to get one to fit I won't order another.


bust is a little small


Love it! It's perfect with Capri leggings and covers my pregnant belly! The colors are true to the photo, too.


Really cute and comfortable


I ordered several sizes larger as it said in the remarks and it was still way too tight and the length of a tee shirt. I was really looking forward to wearing this.  What a joke!!!


Cute dress, very tight at the arm holes.


Love this dress. So pretty and comfortable. Wore it to a party and received so many compliments.


I never write reviews but I LOVE this dress! Just got it today and it was exactly what I was looking for. Not too short, not too long, loose and comfy yet super cute!! The material is so soft, but not thin which I don't like. Great dress!!
