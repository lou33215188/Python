I'm only giving 2 stars cause the colors are cute and true to picture. I'm 5'3, 115lbs and I ordered a small and it looks like a night gown, it's way too wide even for a t shirt dress. Not flattering at all. Maybe it's not for thin people.


Snug in sleves.


I wish it just was a little longer and would of reached the top of my knees so I didn't have to wear leggings underneath.


I'm 5'3 135# 34B and the small fit great! Love the ombre colors!! Soft and comfy!


Love it, it's so cute, i ordered more in different colors.


This dress is basically a big tee shirt.  Not flattering, stiff material, and high neckline (not a scoop like in the picture.  Give it 2 stars for the pretty colors.


LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tunic!!!  I wish the other colors were available in the 3x.  I love the material.  My favorite tunic by far.


I loveeeeedd this dress. it was beautiful and good quality. I was afraid it would look nothing like the picture, but it really does! I cannot wait to wear it to the beach! I've already received so many compliments on it and I plan on purchasing more in different colors.


I also love this dress it is made very well and starting although again because I am only 5'2" it is too long and a little too big I am wondering as well if this will shrink if I wash it in hot water and dry it?? Or should I return it?


Was a little small in the bust area. Good value!
