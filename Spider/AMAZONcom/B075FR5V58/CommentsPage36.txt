Nice shape. Slightly tight across bust. Material feels like a dry fit shirt so I hope it will feel nice in warm weather. More like a long shirt than a dress. I'll be wearing it with leggings for sure.


Nice looking dress, but sizing too small


Horrible fit.  Looks nothing like this.


Cute style. Threads on one seam are a bit loose (easily fixed), but overall great deal for a cute, lightweight dress to wear with leggings.


It's okay - kid of bag-like.  I like it for wearing around while grocery shopping or taking the dog for a walk.  I'm a little chunky, so of course it looks better on the model!


This dress is adorable! Fits perfectly (not too loose, but not completely shapeless either) - perfect casual Summer dress!


Cute, good quality. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. I am tall (a little under 6 ft) and it is definitely a mini dress, but not too short.


I just got the dress and so far it's a win. Did arrive smelling like chemicals but a quick wash fixed that issue. I'm 6ft, 36DDD, size 8 and I ordered a large. It is really short and hits right above my finger tips. I bought this for the beach so length isn't an issue.


Your size chart is incorrect. Because I relied upon it...my daughter was furious when I explained I didn't order it small to try to make fun of her. I wrapped it as a token but WILL be returning and have to try to "guesstimate" which size she actually is for exchange Very cute dress for a small junior, not a medium women's size!


Super comfortable, and looks similar to the photo. I was cautious after reading some other posts that the dress was tight in the chest- I went with the small. I am usually a size 2 or 4 and the small was too big on me. I have a full chest, and the dress still hangs off me. Size down.
