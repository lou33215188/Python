Love this easy slip on dress


Love the dress  the colors are pretty the material is soft washes easily has not shrunk fits as expected


Just as cute in person as on the model (is that overconfident? Haha). The material is stretchy and good quality!


Very comfy and casual. Received lots of compliments! I'm 5'0" 105 lbs, got an XS. Fits like a shift dress on me


Very comfortable dress. The ambre effect was a bit darker than shown. The aqua top is more of a darker teal and the bottom a steel blue.


Super cute. Wearing it now with capris. Love the colors!! So pleased.


Love it!


cute!!!


Loved the colors! The top was way too small, by 3-4 sizes. Gave to my daughter who wears a large (I wear 2x-3x).


Very good quality. Nicely made.
