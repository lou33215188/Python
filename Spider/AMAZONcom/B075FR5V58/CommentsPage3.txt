I ordered this to wear as a tunic since I am not one to wear short skirts/dresses unless they are skorts.  That said, this is long enough that in a casual setting like an outdoor party, I might just wear this without the leggings since it falls just about 2 inches above my knee - not really a short  short dress like some. Everyone's body is different (longer or shorter torso, etc.) so your experience may be different.  I measured the dress (while it was laying flat) and the distance from armpit curve to hem was just under 28" - in case that helps folks to gauge how this dress will work for them. I generally wear a medium or large shirt, depending on cut and manufacturer and this fits perfectly. I don't have skinny little arms and the sleeves fit well - though I will need to dry this on gentle or I might find them a bit tight if there is any shrinkage during washing/drying. (I'll try to come back with an update after I launder this garment.)


Color is exactly as pictured/expected (I would describe this as a bright army green with a light navy blue ombre border.) Material is soft, like the lighter weight t-shirts I like to sleep in, so very comfortable. Overall, I am very pleased.  For the price this can't be beat. Not too fond of the other color choices, or I might order some more. A white with a navy blue ombre border would be nice...


I really like this dress. I ordered an XL but wish I had gotten a L. I am 5'9, sz 14, 38DD and it fit well but wish it wasn't quite so baggy. It is not long enough to be a dress for me but is a great tunic. I love the colors so much. Great tunic.


I ADORE this dress. I bought it with this denim jacket and the boots for a date. Sorry it's covered, however, I couldn't be happier. It fit perfectly and has comfy fabric, i can't wait until i get paid so i can buy another!


I typically wear a 2x. I purchased a 3x due to the type of material. It was STILL small. Also, the one I received had something spilt on the bottom. Not sure what it was, and it came in a ziplock bag with no tags. Pretty sure I was given someone else's return  :(


I have never been led so astray by Amazon reviews before. I bought this for a casual event and let's just say it is getting returned and now I have to find something else quickly!


I was shocked when I opened the package to find a literal t-shirt. I tried it on hoping it was deceptive... I'm only 5'4" and it didn't even cover my butt cheeks entirely. Also, kind of bit picky but the colour is not really the same as pictured. A bit more green.


Very bummed!


:(


Like others have written, the material and quality of this dress are great. The color looks exactly as pictured. It is a super comfortable dress to wear on hot summer days. Writing this review mostly to give a reference for size. I am 5'3", weigh 128 lbs, and wear a bra size 34DD. Because I'm larger in the chest area, I ordered a medium. Were it not for that I would definitely been better off buying this in size small - for anyone who is even one bra size smaller than me with a similar height to weight ratio, I'd recommend a small. The medium fits me perfectly in the chest area, although the sleeves and rest of it is a bit more loose fitting on me than I would like. I will just wear it with a belt to cinch it in at the waist.


Love it ğŸ˜�


Love this dress! Fits relatively loose and comfy for summer. I'm 5'5, 200lbs, 38DD, and the large fit perfectly!


I love how stretchy the material is, and like other reviewers stated, it is a good compromise between thin and thick. Not so thick that it will be hot but also not so thin that when it stretches will look sheer. I ordered a 3xl and I am very top heavy, 5'8" and 225 lbs, this dress was tight in the bust but large and loose fitting everywhere else. For normal or smaller busted plus sized women, this dress would not fit so snugly up top. It's extremely comfortable and the color is true to the picture as well. I would order again if they made printed dresses.


Cute, really comfy. If you have larger arms the sleeves may be tight.


There was something weird about my dress. On both the front and back, there is a diamond shaped imprint with some adhesive looking stuff, like there was some kind of decoration that had been removed.


I'm 5'5", 135lbs, 34B and got the medium.
