I really wanted to love this dress but the cut is off. The neck line is cut too small so it doesn't fit well across the chest and pulls. If the neckline was cut a little differently it would be perfect. The material on this dress is much heavier than the Tie Dye Ombre Dress, which I absolutely love! I normally wear a size 6 and the length on the small was perfect but the top portion was too tight so the small didn't fit right and I suspect the medium will be too long so I returned the dress.


This dress fits like a glove and the material is thick enough so that you don't see anything you wouldn't want seen.


Wonderful dress! Have worn as a beach cover up and also to run errands - very comfortable!


Too tight all over.


Sent back.  Runs small and the sleeves are very tight!


Looks frumpy


Lightweight.  Perfect for summer!


Nice product, Very satisfied.


Fun color ...I wore with leggings


Cold wash and line dry.


Too short on me to be a dress. However it is really cute so I'll wear it with some skinny jeans
