I love this dress but I need to return it b/c it's too small.


Great quality


Our daughter loves this soft T-shirt dress.


It's ok , runs a little small


It is comfortable


Ordered larger size but too small. Runs very small


Cute dress, fits well and very comfortable to put on after the pool.


Wasn't wowed by it so I returned it. The fit seemed a little off and the neckline seemed tight but would be cute with a belt.


LOVED the dress, so soft, cute colors. The only issue I had was the size, and maybe I didn't read the size chart properly. I returned the dress but ordered another in a new size!


Love this dress/cover up.  Nice material and washes beautifully!
