it's an oversized shirt, so that's why I selected somewhat large. I went in knowing this, wanting an oversized shirt. Hence; the "T - Shirt Dress" Description. It's ADORABLE w a cute pair of leggings!!! Love it!!!


LOVE this dress. I am 5'4, 170 pounds, 44D and I normally wear a L or XL in anything. The XL fit me perfectly! Glad I didn't go with the L or it might have been a little too tight in the chest. Highly recommend!


I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress! It was such a great price and is exactly as described. I am 5'3 (on a good hair day), 129 lbs and ordered a small. Fits great.


The fabric doesn't wrinkle, it packs well, and is appropriate both as a beach cover-up and a casual summer dress that is nice enough to go to dinner in!  The color is beautiful too.  I love this dress.


Great top, excellent price. Super comfy. Sizing was a bit tight in the shoulders but I have broad shoulders. Plenty of room everywhere else. I wear this a lot. Colors are great.


Beautiful color as pictured (sage green to blue) and the material is a very comfortable cotton/stretch blend but at 5'8 with a little bit of a booty this was more of a long t-shirt than dress. Would absolutely need to wear with shorts. Returned.


I had to return for a size larger because it clung a little more than I like but it fits great and has a good amount of stretch. Really comfortable and cute.


I'm 5'6", 128 lbs, ordered a small and this thing is HUGE on me.  Way, way too big.  I'm returning it, which is sad because I like the color and fabric.


Very cute. I’m usually a medium and the medium fit well. It’s mesnt to be flowy. Good price for a cute, casual, summer dress I can see myself getting a lot of wear out of.


Super cute summer dress - can be worn with shorts beneath, unless you like SHORT dresses.  Works as a swimsuit cover up, too.  Could transition to fall with leggings.  Inexpensive, good for travel!
