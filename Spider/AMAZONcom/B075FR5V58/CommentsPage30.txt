Love this dress. Fit perfectly and looks great!  I bought the small and am 5'6" 130lbs. for reference.  Great dress for casual or can dress up.  Highly recommend!


Very cute.would be perfect with leggings.I ordered my size and my own fault , I didnt realize it was junior sizes.it will be a Christmas present for a friend.


Love this dress!  I am 5 ' 5" and about 160lbs. and ordered a large.  Fits perfect.  I will use it as a swimsuit cover up.  Perfect.


I was expecting a shorter tunic like dress.  It fits snugger than I thought it was on top, but it does fit.  If you have a larger bust, go up a size.  I am 5-3 and it goes to my knees.  I bought the 2 x.


I love this dress, so comfortable! I think it's really cute, but my husband said it resembles a nightgown :-) I do not think so at all!


Loved the color and the material, but sadly the cut was not suitable for me. I returned the item.


Love this dress! The material is way higher quality than I expected for this price. I am 5'4" size 14 and bought an XL and it fits perfectly.


I love the color and material... but the arms are very small.


Very unhappy with the fit. In the XXL size the fit was way to small across the shoulder and through the arms. I was very disappointed. Gave it to my much  smaller child. Wont buy from this seller again.


Super cute. And after reading the reviews I ordered two sizes larger than usual. I ordered a 4x instead of a 2x. It fits fine but ITS NOT A DRESS!! It come right to my thigh! It'll be cute with leggings during fall!
