Great dress! Super soft material! A little short (I'm 5'2" and it is short on me).


I loved it so much! Its so perfect for summer. Unfortunately a hurricane swept mine away BUT it really is fantastic. Would buy again if i was in a hot country again!


This dress is adorable. I am 5'1 and I purchased the small. The dress goes maybe an inch above my knees. The material of this dress is like a t-shirt, it's very comfortable.


I love this dress.. I was so happy with it and washed and hung dry just like all of my clothes. Super cute I recommend


Love this dress. Bought an xl and it fits perfect. Can't wait to wear it.


Update: I bought two more of these, the lilac xl for myself and multi 3x for my sis in law. And to my surprise the 3x and xl are the same.ğŸ˜¦ I am so disappointed cause my sis in law loved my dress so I bought it as a gift for her. Going to return.


comfy.for casual or dress up with pearl strand or as you wish..dress speaks for itself and fits perfectly..


I love this simple summer dress. I get lots of compliments when I wear it and can't believe this is only about $10!


Nice fabric but very small throu bust and arms. Had to return. Order larger than you wear normally.


Mine is a little tight but I still really like the comfort and pattern.


It is so beautiful! Love the color. It is exactly the same with what I expected. Happy with my purchase.
