Love this! It's comfy and the perfect fit!


For my cruises!


This dress is so comfy and perfect for spring and summer weather. Great length too!


Very wide right at the chest.


Not true to size.


OK


Bought for my wife. She loves the dress. Kind of like under armor fabric. Thin like material. She said it feels real good when wearing it.


This is a cute run around town dress for the price. I am normaly a 16-18 and this fits just tight in the breast area- you may want to size up.


I ordered a 3x and it was pretty tight and it was pretty short i wouldn't wear it out in public. I'm gonna keep it as a night shirt I guess.


Love this dress! Bought it for a trip to San Diego and it was so cute! Great value
