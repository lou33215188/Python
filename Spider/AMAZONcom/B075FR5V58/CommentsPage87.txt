Very nice fabric. Relatively lightweight without being see-through.


Computer dress


i really wanted to like this dress,


its super cute, but its just too loose.


i'm 5'2, 145, i got the large, and i feel like i should have gotten the medium.


still a very cute dress, paired with boots or sandals, perfect little day dress.


Feels silly writing a review about a t-shirt dress but I love this dress. I'm 5'3 and it hits above my knees l. I get tons of compliments (again, odd for a t-shirt dress) but the fabric is amazing! It's thick and not clingy but also doesn't look tent-like. I love it!


Fun


stiff and rough fabric


Way to big, very disappointed! The material is nice and soft but so Big.


i hope that eventually they get my size in all the colors because i am obsessed with this dress. i get a million compliments everytime i wear this!


Love this dress it fits great and is light weight


I love this dress! It has a comfortable fit & the colors on the dress are as shown.
