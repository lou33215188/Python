Love it! So comfortable and cute.


Beautiful. Runs to size don't buy larger. Quality material beautiful ombr√©


It was OK but the colors are faded.  Why buy a new dress that is already faded?


This is very cute and soft, but shorter than expected. It looks as short as it does on the model, but I'm only 5'4".


Love this dress.. Fits as expected. I'm 5'1 and 175lbs I ordered a medium. I hand washed and let air dry. I want every color. :)


Very comfortable and cute
