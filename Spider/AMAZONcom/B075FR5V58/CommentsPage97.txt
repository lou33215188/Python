Really cute on a hanger but a little too big and somewhat unflattering


Arms very tight and way too short on me


Cute dress.  A little smaller that I had imagined, but I still like it.


Cute print but stiff material that isn't flowy so it's just kinda there.


Love it I have another one in a different color.


Great dress. Very comfortable


Not very flattering for a thin frame.


Love this dress, so cute. Was extremely bummed when I accidentally ruined it with grease stains...alas.


I knew I was taking a risk on if this would fit. But since I am quite busty, it fit like a tee shirt instead of a dress. Also the neckline was too high and if just fit oddly on me. Seemed like okay quality, just wasn't the right garment for me.
