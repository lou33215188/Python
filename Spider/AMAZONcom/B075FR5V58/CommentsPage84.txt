Perfect length. I'm 4'8" and it hits right above the knees. I did size up because they tend to shrink in the wash.


I've gotten a million compliments on this dress. I was afraid that it would arrive and be too short. I'm 5'3" and it was just long enough so that I didn't need leggings.


Great casual throw on dress


Fits nicely . Good summer dress


I got this dress in a size larger then I normally wear because I didn't want it skin tight. I LOVE IT!! It's soft, moves easily and feels so comfortable. I will be buying more of these


Great little dress to just throw on or to wear as swim suit cover up


Suuuuch a perfect comfy dress


Very comfortable and true to size.


Small but ok


love it
