Ok flattering


Absolutely Perfect!  Will definitely be ordering another!


Cute dress and seems like pretty good quality. Sizing runs big. I'm 5'6" and weigh about 130 (32D, 28" waist). I ordered a medium and it's a bit large. I'm still going to keep it and wear it as a cover-up.


Absolutely love this dress! Fit is great and fabric is breathable. Looks just like the picture! Can't wait to take this to the beach. Will be purchasing from ROMWE again in the future.


Gift


I get tons of compliments on this dress!


Cute, but a little short for an older woman


The Hem is uneven, seriously shorter in the back. I'm sorry the construction is flawed since I really like the dress other than that.


runs small and is tight in the shoulders and arms I am sending it back.  Also the fabric isn't as soft as expected and the color was more green than shown.


Item as described, color as pictured; dress is very soft and somewhat short. Arrived promptly.
