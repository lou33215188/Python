Way way small. Pretty & looks comfortable but very small.


It's a nice dress, but it was quite bulky.  I was expecting something a little bit slimmer.


cheap materials


I like it, but have to wear it as a shirt and not a dress lol...its cute tho.


Cute and comfy, i think mine shrunk a little from washer/dryer


Too small and the color was kinda weird. I kept to give to a smaller cousin.


It's not great but is wearable


The colors are beautiful. It fit slightly smaller than I expected but the dress is beautiful.


Fits like a t shirt. I'm 5'8 and i can't wear it alone.


Super thick material. Perfect for fall!
