This should be a great dress to wear to the beach.


I'm 5'9" 28" waist, a small would fit better than the medium I got. But overall it's cute!


Love this. So comfortable. Fabric is soft and flexible


It runs a bit large for me. XS feels like S. But quality is good.


I love the color, but it rises up and chokes your neck like a boy's shirt.


I am short and it is short on me.  Neck a little higher than I expected.  Good $, good color, comfy...


Comfortable and cool summer wear for casual days just wash and wear.


The colors are beautiful. The material has an appropriate amount of stretch to it.  The dress is way too small. It would fit the average 5th grader. My usual size is a small, and this simply did not fit. I’m guessing my size in this dress would be a large, but I’m not taking that chance. Returning it.


Cheap material, but is very comfy.


Fits like a dream! So soft and I got an amazing amount of complements!  I cannot say ANY thing bad about it.
