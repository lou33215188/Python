This item fits a little snug in my shoulder/arm/chest area.  I am a pretty stocky build though.  I am 5'3", 180lbs and very hour- glass shaped.  The top is a little snug, and the bottom is very generous.  I wear a 38DDD size in chest though-so I am sure that comes into play also.  I love the style of the dress though.


I really liked this dress, but I bought the wrong size. I am 5'3" and 175 lbs and, while the size L did fit, it was a lot snugger than I prefer. Also, the arms were super tight on me, which was disappointing because they are the reason I bought the dress. The fabric is stretchy and clingy, but feels thicker than some of the dresses that I bought with it. I intend to repurchase in a larger size.


I bought an XL, when I normally wear a M, it is a great fit as 2 sizes larger worked out perfect, it fits loose as it looks on the model.  I recommend ordering 2 sizes up, it worked for me, the fabric is stretchy and you can not see through it. It would be good for any occasion, dressed up or down, even as a beach cover-up. It looks like it will wash and hang to dry perfectly.  I am 5'2", 125 lbs. it falls to just cover my knees.  Juli, age 63


I read all reviews, and was slightly cautious when ordering this - but I loved the ombrÃ© look, so I took the plunge. I'm certainly glad I did! I sized up one, because reviews indicated that it ran small. I definitely like the fit, because I sized up. It's a bit baggy, which I like, but still has some shape. Very forgiving in the belly. I'm 5'10 and 180 lbs. I saw some reviewers stating that this dress was short... it is, but it certainly covers everything it needs to. I wouldn't wear it to work, but for a night out the length is just fine! Would order again.


I'm a size 18 with really big arms. I'm 5 9'. This fit like a short cute casual dress. No way I could wear heels with this because it'd be way too short but I love this. Just enough stretch for my arms to get in comfortably. Any smaller and it'd be a tunic top and too small for my arms. Definitely take a chance on this item because it's really cute blue green color. Good quality in my option. I plan on hand washing and air drying. ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


After reading a lot of the comments I decided to go with a L just in case the M didn't work. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when I got the product because basically I have to wear it as a top. It is definitely not a a dress, I'm only 5'4Â¨ and it barely covers my butt. The material and the color are nice but the style and execution should be modified. I would not buy again.


This is super comfortable, very flattering in the stomach area and very soft! I ordered a large, I'm 5'7 150lbs so I always worry about dresses being too short and this hits a little below mid thigh...perfect length! I am going to buy all the colors! Love this!


I'm 5'7" and a size 14. I got an XL in greenish to bluish ombre, and it's great! The arms are a little snug, but the fabric is thick and stretchy. It hits just above my knee. I'm buying more in different colors.


First off, this dress is very comfortable!  The quality of the fabric and construction is amazing.  The color is exactly as the photo, although mine is more of an ombre and less of a tiedye look, but I like it anyway!


I am 5'1", 125 lbs and the small seems to swallow me. The fabric is somewhat thick and is a little stiff, so it doesn't move or flow well.  I washed it a few times to try to loosen it up, but it still seems a bit stiff.  I tried to belt it, but it bunches in weird areas.  I'm still going to wear it for the sake of comfort, but It may not be the most flattering on petite frames.  I might try to take in the side seams a teeny bit to reduce the bulkiness a tad.


For the price, I would consider purchasing again in a different color!


I wanted to like this dress. First off, the fabric is stiff which makes the bottom stick out in a weird way. I thought that washing would help soften it, but it did not and now I cannot return it. The medium fit fine except for the arms.  (I'm 5'5", 130lbs and 34B) The sleeves are cut in a strange way. They fit around my bicep, but they feel too small from my armpit to my shoulders, and this causes the dress to ride up anytime you move your arms. I will wear it around the house, but I don't think I would wear this out.
