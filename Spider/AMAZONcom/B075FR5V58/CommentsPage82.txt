Just a bit loose.


Great tunic! Very comfortable, like a t-shirt. The material is very nicely made and perfect for lounging or getting dressed up! I'm 5'4, 180 lbs and the XL fits perfectly. I wear it with leggings.


Too thin


perfect for  causal day


Love this dress for casual wear. It is a bit short for work (I’m 5’6 155 lbs).


Top is very tight and I ordered one size larger but overall it's what I was looking for.


Great for a casual summer day?  Washes like a dream.


Not comfortable or breathable fabric. Doesn’t have the dip dyed look and is way wider than the pic


Too small it's very short


Shorter than elected, but fun and comfy.
