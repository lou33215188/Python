Disappointing fit.


It's tight at the top, even though I bought a large, my usual size.


Super cute and good quality


This is my go-to dress, I love it. Color is true to picture. Length and weight are perfect for summer.


Love! a little tight in the bust and i ordered my usual size.


I ordered an XL and it was too short and too tight on my body. I am 5'5 and around 170lbs. Normally I don't have problems with dresses like this, but the fabric was just too stiff.


not enough chest room and arms were tight


I ordered the XXL, it runs a little small on the top and it a very short dress.  This is great for the beach or to wear with leggings.


The color is perfect, the dress is insanely soft which is a must for me as I have a sensitive skin condition where I can't wear certain clothing because of it. All in all I'll probably buy it again.


Ordered  size XS. Fabric  is very soft like  a  favorite  t shirt .  Neckline  is a little  different  than  pictured...not as scooped . ..more straight  across . I am  only  5 foot tall, so dress  is also not quite  as  short as shown .  Fun  dress  for a casual  summer  day.
