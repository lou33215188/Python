Order a size larger If you don't want a super tight fit dress. Really love this and for the price you can't go wrong.


I liked this dress for the most part but it flares out at the end so it wasn't what I was going for. Good material though.


Cute just too small. Not really a swing dress.


I love everything about this dress!!!


love it!


Nice simple dress, alittle short


I did not like the colour nor the fit. It looked faded and old to me. I understand that the fit was supposed to be a little loose, but it seemed too cloaky for my size.


Super cute. Not too long or too short.


you have to be built like a Christmas tree to get a true fit, there is no room in the arms or across the chest. Tried 3 sizes and none fit like they should.  All going back.


love it
