Fabric is super soft, color is fantastic, disappointed in fit as too small.


I ordered a large,but fit like a small. Like the color style. Disappointed.


OMG, this dress. I saw it on a Buzzfeed video and instantly went looking for it. I'm not disappointed! The fabric isn't too thin or thick, and the dress can be easily dressed up or down. I'd buy again!


Love it.


Really liked it, but didn't was so tight across the bust.  Sent it back immediately.


Cute. I think I will buy another color.


Looks great on her!!


Cuter than the photo.  Great material gorgeous color.  It's short.


Not really what i expected but i kept


I bought this larger than my normal size because I was worried about the length and I was right. The dress is shorter than I'm accustomed to wearing. The fabric and color are really nice and I'm going to keep the dress and wear it with leggings.
