Dress is shaped oddly. Not sure ill wear it.


Good quality but came with a misstitch


Giving this a one star rating was me being generous...


Not a true 3x


Not for thin people.. looks very large and unflattering


Returned....didn't like the fit.


Cute.. very comfy


Fit as expected. Really cute and great for the summer.


I gave this one to my smaller sister.  :)


Was a whole by the collar that I had to repair ğŸ˜Ÿ
