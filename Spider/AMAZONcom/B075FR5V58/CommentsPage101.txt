Color is nice (I ordered the green/blue ombre). Great value for the price and the perfect comfy casual dress.


Not good for thin people. Goes really BIG... The color and the design are really cute.


Very cute, flowy...but be forewarned, it shows sweat SO easily! Still kept me cool, though, while out on a long city walk and great fit for a plus size girl :)


Pretty but runs very small 2xl fits like an xl.


Nice material, breathable. Good quality, a little short. But fits perfectly, I bought a size large.


How are there not a ton of reviews about how awesome this dress is?? It's simple yet chic, soft, the color is exactly as pictured, and it's just the right length - I'm 5'5" and it comes to a little above my knees (that model must be really tall). Also, to help with sizing, the large fit me perfectly and I weigh 140. It's totally flattering on and everyone who sees me in it wants one. I've told them, lucky Amazon find. At this price and quality, if there were more colors I'd be collecting them. Fast shipping also. Yay!!


Really cute dress. Fits as expected. Get lots of compliments when I wear it!


Loved the shirt but size was no where near a 3x.


Way to small and chokes the neck.


really really small
