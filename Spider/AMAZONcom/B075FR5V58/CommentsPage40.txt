The tunic is made of fabric that feels very strange, like plastic. I ordered one size up and it was very tight. Returning it.


Nice comfy cotton. Good quality for the price. I got an extra small and I am 5' tall and 110 pounds.


the Tunic says its a 3X but its no where near a 3X, I gave it away. Sometimes things are cut smaller. Very disappointed!


Doesn't really look like the picture. Similar, but not the same.  I ordered 3 different shirts.  Said they were made in the US. Two of them were.  This one was made in China.  It was smaller than the other two.


tight in the arms and chest, order up one size than normal.Neckline is much tighter and higher than shown on the model.


Fits well, I'm 5'6" and have a round booty, it's still not too short for work. Loads of compliments on the green-blue version, and I am quite pleased with it.


This dress was too tight and short, not flowy as seen in the picture. I do not recommend if you are curvy or plus size unless you like things tight.


The dress is pretty, but it is REALLY short.  I ordered a medium and I returned it because it is so short - I am only 5'2".


Very nice comfy dress, just be aware it fits snugly so if you are the  loose style lover get it 1 size bigger


Fabric is on the thicker, solid side, but feels good against skin. I am a short hourglass figure and find the cut flattering. Good value for price.
