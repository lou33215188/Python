Returned. Have lots of clothes of the size I ordered. This is definitely undersized ‼️


A little long for me at 5' tall. But the fabric is comfy.


Cute dress. What I expected after reading all other reviews. Dress is short (mid thigh-I'm 5'-3") but that's the style these days.


Absolutely adorable!  I wore this with capri leggings and I received a ton of complements at work!


Very cute on, nice material n comfy


Nice dress - figure flattering - May need slip only reason not a five star,


Love it. It is so soft!!!


I loved this color but it was a little short.


Love love love! Ordered one size down and it fit perfect! Wish they had solid colors too


Love the gradations in the colors of blue.  I do not really like the fit.
