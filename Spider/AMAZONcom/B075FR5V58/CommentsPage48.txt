A lovely dress for summer casual wear.The color is as exactly in the picture.Small size fits perrfectly for my weight 110 lbs and length for me at 5'.2" is just above the knee. The quality of the material is excellent, thick t'shirt material. Straight out of the package ready to wear with needing iorning.This dress is fantastic value for money and I would recommend it as a great purchase. Hopefully, they will make it in more colors soon.


The fit was as expected (I ordered a L and XL) but BOTH were strangely made and NOT flattering.  I returned both.


This dress is really cute, fits well, and is not too short (I'm 5'8", so that's rare). But be warned: it shows sweat very easily...


Loved this dress.  It's like wearing a cozy night shirt.


This is a great dress for the price. The quality is good and looks/fits as shown in the picture. people mention this product all the time


Absolutely love it! Im 5’3” and 165Lbs. I ordered an Extra Large and it fits perfect. Its loose fitting but not baggy!


It is a nice dress, good material but was too short for me. I'm only 5'4" and it was not appropriate for much more than a bathing suit coverup.


It’s incredibly comfortable and colors are vibrant as expected, just note the neckline is a bit more constricted compared to the picture. My product was a true crewneck neck line.


Much smaller than described.  Love the dress, the color and the fabric.  I would order at least two sizes larger based on the dress I received.


The colors are great. It's runs a little wide. I'm on the smaller side so it's a little overwhelming.
