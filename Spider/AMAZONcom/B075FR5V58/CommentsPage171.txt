This dress fits perfectly, the colors are great and it is very comfortable.


It was too small so I returned it; however, I would have returned it anyway because it did not seem to be good material and the colors were very drab.


Wasn't big on the quality so I gave it away.


Ordered 3xl fits my 120 lb daughter perfectly


This was a good buy, but the material did not convince me I would not pay $12 for it, good I just paid $3


SMALL ğŸ˜¡ Will likely shrink when washed & dryer. Ugh!! Cute dress to use as a swimsuit cover up.


Like the color and style but it does run small for an extra large.


Really comfortable but should have ordered a medium! I am bigger chested and just needed some more room!


So comfortable and cute. I highly recommend.


Love this dress, however I order a c small because I'm a bit petite and it was still a bit big. Overall it's was a good buy.
