To clingy, wanted a looser flow.


Great dress! I am in love! I usually between XS-S, and XS fitted just right without being too short.


Perfect colors. A Medium+ or a super snug Large. Fabric isn't horrible but could be more softer. It truly is beautiful, versatile and flattering.


Supposed to be 5x.  More like a 1x.


I have had so many compliments when I am wearing this dress.


2x is more like a large to x large.


Runs very Small. Too tight in the shoulders.


I really like the thickness of this fabric. Not too thick or thin. Not see through at all. Also like the length. Much better than others Ive purchased here.


A little bit shorter than I wanted it to be, it would be fine to wear to the beach or with leggings.


Love this dress! I'm 5'3 and 140 lbs. I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. I've gotten tons of compliments on this dress. It's extremely comfortable and I know I'll be wearing it a lot this summer!
