Bought this for my daughter. We love it. So nice and comfy.


I like this one a lot.


Dreary color in person.


Love this dress! I am 5'4 and 130 lbs. I can wear it as a dress without it feeling too short. It will also look cute with leggings and a denim jacket in the fall. I ordered a medium and it fits well.


Fits well


Was very disappointed in this, both in size and appearance.  I returned it for a refund.


It was cute but I'm 5'9" and it was way too short.


I love this dress so much I'm buying it every color. Haha


cute shirt dress, but didn't like fit on me.  Returning


my wife likes it very much
