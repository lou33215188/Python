I ordered an XS based on my height and it was just a tad snug across the shoulders and chest.  So I gave it to my daughter and ordered a SMALL for myself.  The fabric is a nice heavy but smooth feeling cotton and I LOVE the colors!


Cute for around the house but it's very short, and I'm short, so I thought it would be a little longer on me. The material is a little stiff also, even after a few washes.


Love everything about this. It runs small so order up a size or two and you won't be disappointed. The color fade from green to blue is adorable.


I was definitely skeptical about buying a dress off of amazon. I had bought a sweater last year for Christmas and the measurements were way off, but this dress was a pleasant surprise. Plus, I trust the writers at BuzzFeed and when this dress was listed as a "must-have" I had to have it!


People, make sure to take your measurements, or at least have a guess to make sure they're right.


I love the dress.  Only gave 4 stars because it is slightly short.  I'm


5'7" and wear a large.  I'm not comfortable in very short dresses - to someone else it might be perfect.  Makes a great swimsuit cover up though!


Itâ€™s a pretty dress but the quality is not there. It snagged on everything!


Great t-shirt material, very comfortable, well made, holds up well after washing and line drying. Good length - I wear it with leggings or capri leggings, I only wish there were more color options, I would buy more.


great material and a good look.  it runs way lager.


I bought a medium, I should have sized down, it fits a little big. I am 5'3" bust 35" waist 31" hip 371/2". I think the shirt is just okay.


Awful awful dress! It's more like a shirt and there's no tags that even show up what brand it is the size was off by about three sizes and my "dress" came with 2-3 oil stains on it that won't come out. DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS. It is a total scam.
