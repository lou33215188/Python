Very soft and comfortable.


Love this dress! Was so excited that they released more color options!


Assumed size ordered was women's as listed. Disappointed


Super cute dress and color but way to small. Fit my my daughter who wears a 12/14 in girls.


Comfy casual dress. I am typically a12/14 and the large fits perfectly!


Love it


Cute but too small.


I want all colors!


Is okay.
