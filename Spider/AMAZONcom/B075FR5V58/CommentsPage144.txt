It's a really cute dress! Flares out a little more than I'd like but still really cute!


Very comfortable


It's okay !!


buying every color


shorter than expected


Very cute and comfy dress for the price.


Love this dress! Comfortable,  love the fabric!


My daughter loved it.


Fabric - good comfy stretchable soft


Stitches double lines which is good


The stiches in the neck is always an issue but they did a great job


Color wise same as the website


Bottom little too flare for me but thats the design which is good for summer


Super cute dress... comfortable!
