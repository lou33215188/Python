This was as described and met all my expectations. It's very comfortable and fitted up top but has a nice flaired waist. I'm 5'3" and 150 pounds, 36D and the medium fits great.


as I read everybody's reviews prior to placing my order, I was still hesitant.  I'm so glad I took a chance.  Very flattering - heavier weight than most t-shirt dresses, so it lays very nice.  Can totally be dressed up or down.


This teal dress exceeded my expectations!


I really love this dress.  i think i would've preferred if it was a little tighter.


Fits nicely.  Perfect for petite stature.


The material was a lot higher quality than I expected. I ordered a medium with some trepidation, but it fits well and is even a little roomy. Clearly runs large. It's the perfect length to wear casually or on casual days to work.


The item should becalled top or tunic, but not dress. It's very short.


Super cute and great color!!


looks great as a dress or with leggings


Cute. VERY short, more like a long shirt than a tunic. I am 5'11, and found that it didn't hit me in quite the right places. The crew neck is also extremely high
