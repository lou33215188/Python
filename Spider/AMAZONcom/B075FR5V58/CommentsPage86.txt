Very cute and flowy! It's light and perfect for a summer's day. No complaints about the fit or material.


5X only if you are talking youth not womens sizes . Thankfully my granddaughter liked it for a sleepshirt.


Good.


I really like this dress! Do size up, and it runs a bit small. I only went one size up and it fits pretty well. Thicker fabric then I thought it would be, and much better quality so that makes me happy! As a 5'10 girl, the dress is a little short, but will be perfect for going to the beach and back yard bbq's. Buy this! You won't regret it.


nice top lays nice.


So comfy!!


Love this dress I'm 5'2 150 size medium and it's fitted on top and flares out fits perfect.....very comfortable will buy another one.


Great fabric and color. I like the length as well. I know it's trendy to have short short sleeves on women's clothing but I wish the sleeves were about 2 inches longer. I am constantly pulling them out of my armpits.


Love this dress!


It runs small
