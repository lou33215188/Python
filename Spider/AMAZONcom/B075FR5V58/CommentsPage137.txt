I ordered a xlg and it fit like a small or med.


I wear a 2x and I got a 4x so it would be super loose. It's almost fitted. ğŸ˜³


Material comfortable, on smaller side. Wearing as pajamas. Would buy again.


A little big but the wife is happy


Super cute on my L frame. Perfect for summer!


I'm complimented on this dress every time I wear it.


My daughter loves wearing this tunic dress . You can dress it up or look casual .


Larger than expected


Ordered my regular size and I wouldn't even try to put this on...would never get it off.


Love this dress! Great quality! And super comfortable! I'll be buying more!
