Cute dress, but it runs short.  Torso fits as expected.  But for tall girls like me, just be aware it is going to be on the shorter side.


Love this dress, the colors are perfect and fabric isn't cheap feeling. I ordered a XXL and it fit me perfectly. I'm extremely large chested so this was a pleasant surprise. It's very flattering on my curves and isn't too short. Only wish there was more colors in the XXL size!


This is hands down just an amazing dresss. Color is great, fabric feels soft and not cheap, cut is as pictured. ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


Inconsistent fit between colors. I bought this dress in two colors. This blue one is smaller and shorter than the green one. The green one fits as expected.


Love the material and the way it feels.  Very comfortable! Love it!


Very nice material. Very cute. Highly recommended.


I ordered a medium, and returned it and ordered a small.  It is a super cute dress and even the small has a looser fit.  It is comfy though and I love it.  Great length.


I get lots of compliments on this dress. I ordered large because I wanted to be sure it fit and I'm glad I did.


If this dress came in multiple colors, I would buy every single one. I'm in love.


I liked it, but the size was too skimpy.  I need an extra large.  My printer is out of ink and I have to find a way to darken the label to send it back.  I'm working on that.  When I get it sent back, just send me an extra large, please.
