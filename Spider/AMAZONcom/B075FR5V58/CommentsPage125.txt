This is my new favorite dress! It is a little short and fits perfectly after I sized up. Washes well.


Nice but runs small


Very cute and falls nicely. Only complaint is that it doesn't really breathe like most summer dresses


It's cute!


I love this dress! I get so many compliments. I'm 5'1, 160 with a D cup and the large fits great in the shoulders and arms.


Yet dress didn't fit not sure what size guidelines they were using. Had to return it


Love, love, love.......so comfy and quality made.


This dress is very nice, with beautiful colors. It does fit slightly smaller than expected, so you may want to order a size larger.


It is good, but right after me, the price is down to $11.99. I paid $18.99.


adorable dress, nice fit and nice material
