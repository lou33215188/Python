So cute, exactly as pictured


Comfortable and pretty!


I LOVE this dress. It is a perfect length and the colors in the fabric blend very nicely. I want more of these!


Too tight around the chest.


T-shirt dress is very poorly constructed. The fit is small. Guess it will be alright to wear in the house, but not out. Just cheap looking.


Nice dress... But it runs way too small... I ordered Xlaege and it fit like a medium... I was disappointed.


I'm going to buy other colors. Love this dress. Comfortable, well made, an amazing price!


A little tighter in the chest area than other shirts of similar shape.


I'm 5'2", 150lbs and I got it in Large which fit me perfectly. The fabric is soft but thick. It had a weird perfume smell to it when I first got it and an odd stain (I thought some dye from another dress wore off on it) in the front of the dress but nothing a good wash couldn't fix.


I'm about a size 14 and I ordered the 2x and 3x, because I was worried it would run small.They both fit, but the 3x was a bit longer and more roomy in the arms. Pretty good dress for the price and the color is exactly how it looks in the picture. Dark blue fading into a green.
