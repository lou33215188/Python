This is a summer staple. Cute flats and sunglasses and you are ready to go. I am 5'4 and 146 and I ordersd the large b/c I have larger arms. Length is perfect: short enough to be cool and flirty but long enough to be appropriate on me. The color is so pretty! A stranger in a checkout line complimented me and made my day. Buy it ğŸ˜Š


I was worried that it wouldn't fit me, but I think this runs a bit big. It's perfect- so fun and swingy and casual. I've been apprehensive about buying clothes off Amazon and this was actually my first time doing that- and I love this little dress.


Cool and comfy and cute I love it I wore it twice ,got compliments both times!  Their eyebrows rose, when I said Amazon $16 ! I plan on ordering a few more sundresses Amazon is the best !


So it looks nice...but the material is the type of material that you CANNOT SWEAT IN! God forbid moisture hits this thing because it'll show...and it's REALLY obvious.


I'm a 36DD and this fit snug but that's fine, it doesn't look terrible. I'm glad I bought the XL. I like the fabric and the colors are beautiful. Very happy


I was worried about how this was going to fit, but I'm pleasantly surprised. I normally wear an XL, but ordered a 2X. I'm glad I did. It's a bit snug in the chest, but fits well otherwise. This dress is SOFT. Like my favorite t-shirt soft. The color is really nice and after three washes still looks new.


I still like the dress even though a 3x, which is usually roomy on me (size 20-22), was rather tight. The dress is 95% cotton so I took a chance. I washed it, stretched it, and hung it up to dry. The dress stretched nicely and fits perfectly now. Love tbe fabric and the length goes well with leggings.


I really like this little dress....it is neat...little small around the arms for me..but that isn't the dress' fault, I have ROUND arms.  So what I did was cut the sleeves in a fringe pattern and now it is perfect...Yes I would order another.


Lovely dress and color, but it's pretty short. I am 5'7" and I ordered a large (I'm not super-busty either), and it is pretty short. It is fingertip length, but that is pretty short on me because of my height. It's a risky dress to wear around my 3 small children (I try not to show my underwear in public-hah!).


This dress is absolutely adorable, and I get tons of compliments when I wear it!  I sized up (I normally wear a medium and got a large), and it fits perfectly...I think the medium would have been too short (I'm 5'5" but have very long legs).
