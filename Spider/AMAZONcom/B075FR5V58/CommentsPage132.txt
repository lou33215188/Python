Love this dress! Cute and fits the way I hoped.


True to size. Very cute and simple dress. Not too short and the material is soft and very comfortable. Great buy!


Item fit perfect and it is super cute!


Ordered a size up and the dress is still too short to wear out.


Highly recommend. Material is heavy enough not to feel flimsy and soft enough to wear all day.


So comfortable! It's really versatile too. You can dress it up or down!


great


Gorgeous top/dress.


Nice dress!


Runs a little small in the chest/arms and was a little short, but fits well overall.
