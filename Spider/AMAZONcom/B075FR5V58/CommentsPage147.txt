Very cute but about two sizes two small


Nice soft material! Looks just like it does online :)


I really like it.  Even though it is a bit small it is ok


Nice quality!


Fits snug through the shoulders but is comfy and nice material.


Fit great


Too short for me, I got a size large and I'm 5'6"


I saw this dress on a Buzzfeed list of great dresses on Amazon and it definitely lives up to the hype.  It's crazy cheap but actually good quality.  I got at least 5 compliments when I wore it for the first time.  Other people have said in their reviews that the top is a little tighter than the bottom which was true for me as well but not an issue in how it fit.  Mine has no markings at all in terms of tags so you know it's that good sketchy stuff from some random country.  And I mean that in the best way possible


So cute and comfy ! Runs a little big


Came on time and fits right!
