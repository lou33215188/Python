Love this cute dress.  It is not as short on me (I'm 5'3") as it is in the woman in the picture, but that's better for me.


I'm 160lbs, 5'3", 34C or D, and the medium fits perfectly-flows but not blousy and hits a few inches above my knees but not too short. Highly recommend!


The dress does look exactly like the photos and fits well, but it arrived with a stain. It looks like the same type of bleach stain that was mentioned in other reviews. I will be returning.


Cute dress.  The dress shrank around the armpit area after a couple of wash.  But I will still wear it.  It will only last for one season.


I love this dress! Cheap and so cute! I'm 5'5'' 150 pounds and I ordered a Large. It fits great!!


Very pretty...size expected!


Really cute dress for just bopping around in.  Even out to dinner or lunch .


Super cute but small tight fit. I probably won't wear it as much as I had hoped.


Very sexy


Love it, comfortable
