The fabric seems to show stains more than most.  I'm not sure why.  I have to treat every spot I get on the material.


super soft, color is perfect. Fit exactly as I thought it would. The material is also good quality!!! would buy again !


Fabric Is So Soft, Fits Great


Very cute dress for my daughter. Excellent value for the price. Washes well, great for travel.


Return the first one and order the next size and the next size doesn't fit any better than the one I sent back to the second one is going back to


Cute and comfy. I'm 5'4" 100lbs and XS fits loosely. Pretty colors and nice fabric.


It's cute for the price. It's a little short for my taste.


Dress is perfect! The fabric hangs nicely with a good weight cotton. Does not wrinkle or cling to you as some fabrics do.


Ordering my second one!


Truly love the colors; it was perfect for my beach days.  I ordered a large afraid a medium would be too tight.  Lenghtwise it fit great.  It was in the mid section that looked a bit wide.


So comfortable and cute.
