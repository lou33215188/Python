Very simple and flattering...not sure how long the coloring will last, but seems great so far considering the price. Easy and cute go-to!


Probably wont wear.  I will give it away.


Had to give it to my teenage daughter because it was WAY TOO SHORT for ME to wear as a dress.  It looks nice on HER though!


I ordered a L but the arms were way too tight (i have big arms) even though the rest of the dress fits well and is very flowly. I'm sad that I have to return it.


I'm 5'4 and 138lbs, curvy in the hips and small boobs- dress fit perfectly.  I usually wear Medium and that's what I ordered and it was great.  Color is true to picture, I'll be ordering more!


My favorite dress ever !!!!!!!!


Great fabric, doesn't feel cheap, and a great value. Bought to use as a swimsuit coverup and will work perfectly for that.


Comfy T-shirt dress. Used as a maternity dress.


Fits very well and best of all because of the high hemline, I find it to be very slimming.


Bought this dress for my daughter and she loves it.  Fit was just as expected.  Quality was as expected.
