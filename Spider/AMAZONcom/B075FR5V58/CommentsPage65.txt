Perfectly soft and comfortable! It goes with everything and looks great with a belt. Definitely buying more in the future


great color,comfortable, well made, thanks


Beautiful ombre design and the material is really nice!


It's cute but the material is really thin so it shows every pic. I got a size bigger too which was perfect. Cute dress in all.


Color and texture good.  I will be using as a gift.


I ordered the short ombre dress and it fits fine, but it is very short in the back. It's odd because the front is a normal length, but the back isn't. Not sure what's up with that, but I still wore it with some leggings the other day and it looked cute.


The fabric is good and it fits great!!


i nabbed a medium & it fit just perfectly. i do prefer that my shirts/dresses are much baggier, so if that's what you're looking for go ahead & get a size bigger. i love the gradient of this cute little piece. very comfortable as well! i'm very pleased with it.


Cute


Perfect fit for my daughter.  She is 5'2 and this dress is long enough to meet dress code at school.  Great color too!
