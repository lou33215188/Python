Fits great! Very comfortable.


Adorable and flattering. Medium was too tight around my chest and arms so I gave it to my sister and am ordering a large instead. I am 5'6 150 lbs wearing a 36 C bra for reference.


Great simple dress. I can be really casual and comfy in this. The simple yet cute style that can be played up or down


Would be great in different material, like cotton


This dress is both comfy and cute!  It is a very cheap price for high quality.  I have washed in a few times and no shrinkage has occurred.  Highly recommend!


Little tight shoulders


Love the colors but it's snug around my chest. I'll have to stick to wearing it around the house or send it back.


love it, I am 5'7  I ordered  medium size it is a little bit too short for my taste. Will get another one size L :)


I ordered an extra large and it fit fine everywhere but my arms, squeezes them. I'm 5'11 so I have to wear leggings with it because it is too short.


If not to small it's like the top is a little bit small but it ok.but  I love it . I want more perfect for summer.
