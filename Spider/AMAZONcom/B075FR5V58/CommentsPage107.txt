the neckline is very high like a crew t shirt or sweatshirt, the cut is very A-line.


Comfy, soft material. The true color is just as vibrant as the picture. However, the material is very sensitive to anything you get on it, so watch out for water splashes or deodorant streaks.


I loved the fit of this dress but there was a huge hole in it when I took it out of the bag! Going to try to order another because it feels so comfy.


Runs small


Dress turned out to be very triangle shaped & not flattering.


Super cute! A little short on me but love the colors!


The color on this dress is beautiful and just as pictured. It is kind of a stretchy material, thicker than cottony tee shirt material, which is what I expected. It is still a beautiful dress.


Very cute dress but definitely smaller than "normal" sizes. I wear a 1X or 2X and ordered a 2X just to be safe. Was still too small so ended up giving to my stepdaughter that normally wears a L or XL.


I ordered the smallest size and it just swallowed me. I had to return it.


Great dress! Soft fabric, sturdy seams, not too short (and I'm a tall gal!). Very nice.
