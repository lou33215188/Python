The dress is cute and fits to size, except it's too short.  I'm 5'3" and it fits 3 inches above my knee.


Great for the price! Just a little shorter than I would have liked. I'm only 5'2


Cute but not high quality.


I love it


Loved this dress! Comfortable and can wear for many different occasions.


Nice!


Cute. Kinda stiff fabric . Shorter than expected. Might not want to dry in dryer


Runs small but over all can't beat the price.


This dress is so cute. I have some tummy but this dress is surprisingly flattering! Love it. Fits great!


A little short and I'm 5'5 but nice material, great color
