Cute but XL fits my XS Granddaughter!


Fits pretty well. A bit tight in the chest arm area but felt great and looks good.  It even isn't too long on my 4'11" height.


A little snug through the bust line and sleeves. Wish it was a couple inches longer. Other than that very comfortable.


Cute shirt. Nice quality material. A little small through chest


Bought for my Granddaughter she absolutely loved it


Love the colors and material but I am 5'10" and it's very short. I am planning to keep and wear it as a tunic with leggings.


great shirt dress for the price!


Very billowy


If you have boobs at all, this "dress" is at best a short shirt.


Fits perfect , material is a nice weight.
