Love this dress! Cute and comfy!  You can dress it up with a necklace and cute sandals or wear as a t-shirt dress.  Going to order in a different color too!


this is my perfect summer dress


Love it! Exactly what I was looking for. Very comfortable! Looks great! Love the color. True to size. Great for a warm day.


runs small, great color though


This t-shirt dress was roomy without making me look like I had on a tent! The fabric is also forgiving! I'm looking into buying another dress in a different color.


I'm a teacher and only 5'1 and it is a tad short for me to be comfortable wearing it to work.  But it will be a great summer dress.


So comfortable and cute. You can dress it up with a jacket/belt or wear it to bed, either way it works and the color is exactly as pictured.


The product is much smaller than advertised and does not fit.  I guess I will have to donate it and will not buy from this seller again.


So comfortable. A very lightweight tee shirt material. I'm 5'5" and about 130lbs and it fits just like the models in the picture.


Can hardly tell front from back.
