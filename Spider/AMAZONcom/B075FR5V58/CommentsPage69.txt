Very comfortable and it travels easily because it's so light.  It was perfect for my recent beach vacation.  I received several compliments on it.


I like the shape, color and length.  I have now ordered one in another color.


Nice product.  It ran a little small through the bust.


Loved this dress! Fit me perfectly!


Cute


cute little dress was way too small and I ordered a large for size 14-16!  I wanted it to be extra roomy.  I'll give it to my daughter.  Price was right.


Too large at bottom, but I will open the hem at sides, seam it down, cut off extra fabric, then hen back up.


Nice quality t-shirt dress, just too tight through arms and bust. The dress ran a little smaller than I anticipated.


I love it, but it shows every drop of water. Don't wash your hands, do dishes, or walk too close to a sprinkler when wearing it, it's like hypercolor.


It fits great!


Love this tee for so many reasons. It is now my favorite!! Love the fit, comfort, and material.
