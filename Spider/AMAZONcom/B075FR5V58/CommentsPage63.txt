The top is a little tight.  It is also pretty short on my 5'7" frame.  I ordered a medium.  I was torn between a medium and a large.  I didn't want it to be "tenty" though, so I went with the medium.  The color is gorgeous, though.


My wife loved the dress. It is a perfect fit. This made for an enjoyable Mothers Day.


Thin fabric.


Cute and made well but very small through arms, shoulders, and chest.  I bought it larger than I wear anticipating it would be on the smaller side and it was still too small.  Very disappointed because I really liked it otherwise.


Received many compliments! Very comfy yet makes you look like your dressed up! Ordered more


for the price this is the best t-shirt dress I ever had so far. the fabric feels high quality too.


Love this dress. Great for the lake


I love these with my leggings. Its comfortable just a little heavy for summer.


A little loose but I throw everything in the dryer. Looking forward to wearing it.


Great for coverup or casual dress
