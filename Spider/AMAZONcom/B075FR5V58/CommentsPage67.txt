Beautiful color and nice texture. It fit me more or less as expected. I definitely need to wear this with leggings, though.


I love this dress. It fits me perfectly! Very flowy and cute.


I'm 5'7" and somehow this was wayyyyyyyy too short. I'm keeping to wear at the beach. If you're a teacher or a mom this is maybe a no-go for every day.


I wish it was longer! Its so cute, well made and really comfy, but its short y'all.. especially if you've got a booty that already raises it.


Great value, I wore this all the time on vacation! So cute and comfy.


Thought it was be a little shorter, more like a t-shirt dress. However this is a literal dress, don't really need pants undertake. I'm 5'7 and 180 and I got a medium I believe. Otherwise I love it. Very nice material.


The dress is very nice and made well, however, it's very tight in the shoulder and breast area. From the waist down it's a lovely swing dress with plenty of room for my hips. I am smaller in the breast area, so I was disappointed in the fit. Sorry, I will have to return.


Love style, color and look. No so much the fabric. Too stiff. Hopefully soften after wash. 5'3 / 130 / 34D


Great, comfortable fit! Casual dress that my daughter wears to church on days that she doesn't want to really dress up. Very cute!


Very cute and comfortable dress. It's a good stretchy material. I'm 5'8 and 170 lbs., and the dress is a little short on me. I ordered a large. It fits a little tight in the shoulders, but fine in the chest area. An XL possibly would be better for someone who's tall I'd suggest.
