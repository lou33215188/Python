Cute but ran small, sent it back.


Runs really small through the shoulders and bust. Ordered my usual size. Returning it.


Super cute, good material, but definitely too big, despite ordering the smallest size. I'm 5 foot nothing, 117 pounds. The length is perfect but it's definitely too wide. Not just "cute and loose fit" wide, but kinda awkward wide. If you have a small frame, this probably isn't for you.


This tunic is a nice quality cotton blend and is very comfy.  I like the simplicity of the blended two colors.


Way too small but easily returned for a no hassle refund.


I really like the color, I ordered a small but I still had to take it to an alteration to fit just right.


Great color and fit. Can be dressed up or down.


Cute tunic if you're 6 feet or taller.  Have to wear leggings or all your goodies will show.  Only thing that really bugs is that the sleeves are like cap sleeves on me.  The joys of being tall I guess.


The dress was of good quality and the colors look just like the picture. I think it runs just a tiny bit small for those who have a large chest.


Nice Dress, and Fit well
