way way too small.


It ok.. I love the color. But it fits a little snug.


Smaller in the shoulders and tapers out, very cute though. And it fits the rest of my body just fine


Some loose string near a seam, but otherwise a very nice tunic.


Fits very nice. Nice feeling fabric. I am a 36DDD, 5'5, and 180


great summer dress-- a little longer than what I expected


Loved the dress. Fits nicely. Glad I ordered it.


Seriously my favorite. Fits to just above the knee. Perfect summer dress!


I'm returning it.


Way smaller than expected! Cute dress though.
