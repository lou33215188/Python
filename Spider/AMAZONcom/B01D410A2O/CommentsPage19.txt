I'm just really heartbroken this didn't fit me. I'm a size 3 in Torrid (Which is 3XL) which was what this was advertised as here on the site, and when I got it it just didn't fit. I'm still crying over it honestly because I just loved the look and feel of this dress a lot and it was soul crushingly awful to have it just not be able to zip up when I had it on because I really liked how I looked in it.


I wish they could go a size higher. It also could have been the cut, this is meant for women who have relatively average frames and I'm a bigger girl.


It's a pretty piece, and I hope whoever else buys one falls in love with it like I did.


This dress is fabulous! I am 5'8" and normally wear a 6 or 8, so I ordered a medium and it for perfectly. The fabric is a nice polished cotton that washes and irons beautifully. I wore it for by husband's Christmas work party and I received compliments all night long. I paired it with an antique pearl brooch and black petticoat, which really takes this dress over the top!


This dress was lovely! The color was spot on and looked perfect with a petticoat underneath. The only trouble I had was zipping it up myself. It seemed to snag somewhere in the back when I tried to do it myself.


After reading reviews about the fit, I ordered a 2x and that was great for me. I LOVE THIS DRESS! The fabric weight is nice, zipper in the back moves nicely, and shoulders fit just right. I bought it for a party, along with a purple petticoat,  but it was so cute, I wore it to work with this lavender bolero.


Zipper broke on first time zipping up and it wasn't because it was to small. Poor quality very disappointed.


Bought this for my friend's birthday and fits her great. Color is beautiful and true to screen. She is a solid 12/14 but has a 36G  chest which makes it almost impossible to get the sizing correct. 4 stars as it fits just right and looks great but will need to be dry cleaned, any washing will definitely shrink it and it will no longer fit over the breast.


I bought this dress to wear to my office Christmas luncheon - It is ok, i am a small or xs - I bought a small and it fits perfectly.  Expected the material to be a little more thicker for the fall weather.  I will need to do a good ironing job on it - as it comes wrinkled and i think that is attributed to the type of fabric used.


I absolutely love this dress. Loved it so much that I bought it in 2 colors and will order additional colors. Might be an idea for my birthday dinner and photos ğŸ¤” I received so many compliments on this dress. The petticoat sets this dress off so please do yourself a favor and add one. You will not be disappointed. I have the Navy blue and the coral which were both paired with a grey wedding shash and grey petticoat also purchased from Amazon. My dresses were true to size and the perfect length.


I am in Love with the dress!!!..Quick delivery..The material is somewhat thin, but nothing a slip cant fix..I am 5'6.5 ((5'7)) and 175 lbs..Fairly Small mid section, 38C cup and thick thighs lol..I usually wear a 10/12 ish in dresses so after looking at the reviews I almost ordered an XL but Im glad I didnt!!..I ordered a L and it  is actually a tad bit big at the top bc Im not that endowed, plenty room in the neck area, and theres room at the waist..It is a beautiful fit and I am definitely  going to order more!!


Super cute and fun dress. Great quality and materials. The length is perfect, I am 5â€™9â€� for reference. My measurements are 42-36-42 and Iâ€™m 180lbs. The large fits great. I paired it with a red petticoat for some volume, a black cardigan and some casual canvas shoes for a laid back look. Was very comfortable.
