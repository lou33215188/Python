People can't believe Amazon sells such stinkin cute dresses! Love the thick 100% cotton!! And this is definitely true to size, I'm between a medium and a large so the large was perfect for me. You don't need a slip because it's so thick, but I always wear one because where I live it's windy! Unless I want a Marilyn moment! Not! Lol. For $25 it's was a steal and so unique! Oh and I gets compliments all the time, so feminine and sweet! Five stars!


I never buy on line because you never know what to expect.  I really love this dress.  I am a 38dd bust and an xx-large fit great.  I think I probably could have done a x-large but the xx-large is great. I have room to move.  I bought the petticoat to go underneath and it is fabulous.  I was expecting a cheap material but it is a really good thick material.  I will buy in other colors.  Very cute. Sorry I didn't include pictures I tried it on when I was sick just to try it.


This dress is absolutely perfect! It's beautiful, well fitting, nicely constructed, bold colors, HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I did purchase a petticoat to wear under and it completes it. I cannot wait to wear it.


Amazing dress !!! I bought this dress for my son's wedding. I received so many compliments on how pretty this dress was.I also purchased the Rockabilly Petticoat Net Underskirt that was perfect and really made the dress classy and beautiful.


I just received my dress and tried it on and it was an absolute perfect fit! i was kind of skeptical that it may be too tight or too short seeing as am curvy but it was perfect and i cant wait to wear it. The size chart helped me get a good estimate of what size range i should go with and it worked out well for me; I would definitely order another dress.


Gorgeous retro dress. Wish the material was a bit thicker so it didn't wrinkle as easily. Very flattering on.


I LOVE this dress! I brought it to wear for Easter but I'm definitely buying more. I'm 5"4, 190 lbs and 38D. I brought a XL. It fits exactly how I want (not snug). I could go down a size as well. I'm going to get as many as I can ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


This dress is impossible to iron, no matter how long or what I used I could not get it to look professional. I thought I achieved it then I put my coat on and no... more wrinkles. I would have returned it, had I not worn it. It's pretty, but the material is cheap. When I wore leggings/tights with the garment it would cling to them and ride up, which at a dinner party with friends and family is not what you want.


Great dress! I am 5ft 7in about 135 lbs with a C bust. This dress comes about to my knees. It fits just right. The fabric is cotton with a bit of stretch so its not terribly wrinkly. Very comfortable and not see though.


This dress is super cute on, very flattering to your figure and just looks classy.  Cotton blend has a little stretch but not very much, I ordered 1 size up and glad I did.  I tried on with a petticoat and it looks fabulous!!!!
