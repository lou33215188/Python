I love the pattern. What a beautiful dress. Unfortunately, my shoulders are too wide for it and I'm abit too overweight for it (285lb, 5"1ft). I missed the deadline to return it so if I can't resell it I'll just give it to my little sister.


Actually, I'm lying. I love this dress too much to return it or to resell it. I'll lose some weight so I can wear it next year for my 20th birthday. I MAY resell it if it gets too big.


Like that will ever happen, LMAO.


My granddaughter loved it.  She was looking for something for her Confirmation and everything she saw was either low on top and very short.  She started looking on line with her mom and then me and she loved the vintage style dresses.  We picked several and then had to pare down to two.  It was hard, but she did it.  She picked the blue one and a polka dot blue dress.  Both looked great , but the blue fit better on the top.


Really disappointed this didn't fit as well as I thought it would.  It is far too large around the busy area but too tight around the waist.


Gorgeous. My daughter looked great and loved the dress. She's tall and slender therefore I paired it with a white full slip- petticoat.


I got so many compliments from unknown people in Disney land ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š


I'm about a size 12, 36H chest.


I bought the XL- fits SO well.


The fabric is very stiff and needs a good ironing on arrival.


The sleeves are a half cap sleeve- so I'll have to wear something else with it to cover my armpits.


The sash does not have loops to hold it in place


I'm about 5'2" and it comes to just below my knees


The color isn't holding up as well as I would like. Its a nice dress, well cut, etc but doesn't have a lot of staying power.  Maybe if you used special detergent and washed it gentle and cold it would last longer.  I don't have time to devote to extra laundry tasks, so this dress isn't for me


I am usually a 1-2x. I tried the 2x and it was too small, so I went up to a 3x. It fits perfectly! It is lovely, well-made, excellent fabric, and the pattern is so cute. I plan on getting it in other sizes too! A must for women of all sizes. Very flattering.


I bought a large because I am a 14 pant size (usa) but a 36 bust (usa) and it fit well everywhere, it wasn't even too big in the chest area. It is not as soft as it looks, but it is a nice fabric. No built in slip (I bought the black dress with red flowers), but the dress is thick and dark enough that one isn't needed. The skirt falls just below knee length while standing. Great dress!


I received the dress in a nice plastic bag marked with the brand name, which is very nice to see. The dress came very wrinkled. The material is a lot nicer than what I had expected at that price, which was a nice surprise. I ordered a medium, I'm 5'4" and around 120 lbs, and the dress fit nicely. It was a bit loose, but just enough so to make it comfortable. This will make a great dress to wear to perform for an upcoming music recital. Overall, I'm very impressed with the quality of the dress and am certainly looking forward to ordering it in more colours.


P.S The dress looks MUCH better with a petticoat.
