Was really bummed when this didnâ€™t fit. Love the color and the cut was just too small in the bust.


Love this dress!!!! It was perfect and if youâ€™re looking for something simple and cute this is it!  I will be purchasing more colors.


The color, fabric  and model are perfect however the size is not. I bought a size medium but it looks like a extra smallğŸ˜©. So sad that I can't wear it.


Perfect and delivered on time


Perfect for my daughters Minnie Mouse dance costume!


Beautiful


So retro and feminine.  My teenager feels like a vintage beauty in this.


Beautiful. quality material . good for the price . to get it to flow like the pic.. you need the tutu under skirt.. sold separately.


My daughter selected this dress for her graduation.  The material was comfortable for her.
