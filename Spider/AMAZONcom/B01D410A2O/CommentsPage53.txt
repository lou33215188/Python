Perfect! Fit exactly as expected and I've gotten tons of compliments on it. High quality materials as well.


I am so glad I bought my regular size. I love this dress. It is so pretty! I feel transported to the 50’s. It’s perfect with it without a petticoat.


My daughter bought this dress to wear to her school's spring formal and she loves it.  She wanted to look like the character "Miraculous Ladybug" and this dress is perfect. The dress arrived on time and fits her small frame perfectly.


I did order next size up based on others reviews and it fit by doing this.  I can usually wear a medium 8-10, but I ordered a large just in case.  The large turned out perfect and very fitted.


I got a 3x (the 2x was out of stock), but I'M GLAD THAT I DID!!! It was very comfortable in the mid section. It was slightly big in the neck and bust area, but nothing your seamstress couldn't fix with a quick tacking. I highly recommend purchasing a petticoat for the full flare!!! So many compliments! For reference: I'm 4'10" and normally wear a dress size of 14.


I do like this dress but the way it looks in the picture is not how it actually looks and the zipper is hard to get up.


Beautiful dress! I just couldn't adjust to it being on me.


I've gained a lot of weight this last year and it was so nice to wear something that was truly flattering again. Made my waist appear small and my figure proportionate. Got tons of compliments


Cute dress but need to order next size.  Ordered it for my mother.


Dress fit fine. Material has some extra stretch to it. Overall satisfied with it. Got it for my class reunion and I think it will work out fine.
