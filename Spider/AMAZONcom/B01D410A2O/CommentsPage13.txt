I wore the red with small black dots for my company Christmas party and got so many compliments!  Paired it with a black petticoat, skinny black belt, and black patent leather Mary Janes.  Very classy, and I felt like the ultimate princess.  I way overestimated the size and bought a medium; 5'3", 34c, 4/6, def needed a small.  I also bought the black/purple roses, can't wait for a chance to wear that one!  I'll have to update with a pic then.


This is my second dress from this particular line. They have great designs and they are made from the same material. They are lightweight dresses that have great flow, they don't cling to the body. The dress provides an hour glass shape to those of us (me) who are shaped like rectangles which is highly appreciated.


The fit runs a little small. I normally wear a 18-22 size on top. I have a larger bust and bought it in a 3X. I would Definietly measure yourself under the bust area (where we are known to have back fat) because that is the place that fits most snug.


For 30 dollars this is a nice quality dress. I see it lasting (a year) as long as you wash gentle cycle, Never put it in the dryer and don't do anything to active to bust a sem.


I would have loved this dress if not for a couple things.  I wear a size 18 dress, 38DD, 5'6".


So my first complaint is that the dress would ride up along the waist and i had to keep pulling it down.  Also, that little fold of skin that happens on some women, where the breast and armpit meet, was very visible in the dress.  Maybe with a cardigan it would work? Also the sash was not really long enough for the larger size to create the bow.


This dress came in within two days. I had already ordered one for my daughter and liked the style enough to order one for myself.  I am 5ft 6in, size 10, and wear a 36 C.  I ordered the Large and it fits great, and I love the length.  It is hard to find modest dresses these days and it came right below my knee.  If you are looking for a cute dress for the summer, this one is a great one.


I am 5'1", size 6/8. 36c. The medium fit well. If I was bigger on top I would need the large. The style is very flattering for most shapes. It hit me below the knee.


I didn't use a petticoat and it looked good like that. I have more of an hourglass shape and that's why I think I didn't need one. Plus I am over 40 and it would start to look more like a costume for me if I used a petticoat, if that makes sense.


I wore this to a religious services but it would work for a wedding, career, date night, party , etc, depending on shoes and accessories and color you choose.


My husband LOVED the dress and I got bunches of compliments. I bought coral and it was a true medium coral. Husband asked me to get another one in blue and I was eyeing the brown and white one. So I may end up getting 2 more.


I wore a nude bra and smoother under, no slip,  and I think the fabric was thick enough. Not too see thru. I'd be careful with the lighter colors though. It also didn't gather around my legs while I was walking.


Very pretty, very flattering, and very comfortable.


Even though we took the measurements the dress was somewhat small.  I suggest to buy half a size or a full size bigger as it is much easier to take it in than it is to let out the seams as there is not much space to do this with.


The fabric is not too thick.  The seams are pretty sturdy.  The length on the dress that we bought was below the knee.  Perfect for church.  My mom usually wears a Medium and we bought a Large just in case.


I purchased this dress in size 2X and it fits as expected. I would recommend that if you are going for the look in the pictures, you purchase a petticoat as I did to get the full effect of the 50's vintage look. It was just breath-taking! My husband loves it too. I love vintage looks and I will be "slaying" this look on Mother's Day 2018.


While I'm not a large girl, I do wear a size 14 normally (which is considered plus size everywhere now which is extremely disheartening) going by the size chart only I ordered a size XXL. It fits as expected from the size chart, tho it is a little too big for me. I'm 5'4 and it is a little bit long, but I'm not wearing it with the petticoat. I will likely purchase on more colors or styles if this wears nice long term. Fabric is soft and it looks well made. If you are a handy seamstress it can easily be tailored to fit better.


I love it! Good material. Great price. Beautiful ! I'm going to be buying more of these ğŸ˜ƒ


The dress wasn't as nice as I expected it to be. I read tons of reviews and looked at the photos and everyone seemed very pleased with it so I was super excited. Maybe it was the color I chose but it definitely seemed more frumpy than I am comfortable with. The color is a true color though.
