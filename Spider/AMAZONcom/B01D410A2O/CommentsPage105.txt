I want to return it I am too short for it to look good on me


Great material and fit


Beautiful dress, comfortable and fits as expected, stick to the size chart.


Looks great!  Fit as expected.  Did need ironing.  Havenâ€™t seen how it comes through the was yet, but was perfect for 1950s party.  Recommend buying separate slip for fullness


Beautiful


Diva Outfit!!!!


Returned! Torso to small!


This dress is made for large chested women. I would guess you have to be a D-cup or bigger to fit this dress without alterations.


Love this dress it's true to its color. I got the color burgundy. I got a large it fit around my waist great but on the chest area it was a little big just had to wash it and dry it. In the future I will be purchasing another one. And the shipping was fast.


Fit is so cute! Better than expected. I'm 5'8 and it hits right above my knee cap, which is a tiny bit shorter than I like with a full skirt like this, but it's so cute that I kept it anyway.
