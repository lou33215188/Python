Great dress. Super cute.  Fit great. Small complaint,  it had  2 loose threads I had to fix (cut) one at the waist line the other at the bottom.  Other than that, perfect


This dress made me so happy. Comfy and so pretty. I love it.


Cut not applicable to American women.  It was a plus but cut more like a standard size 9 if we were to buy it in a store here.  Very disappointed because the style was adorable and color was great.


The dress is cute in the picture but if you are a thicker girl it doesn't look as cute on. The dress was too small in the stomach hip area and the "bow" that comes with it does NOT actually fold like a bow it can either be a loose sash or a tight small little awkward looking bow I think the amount of fabric that is made to be a bow is the same amount whether its a small or a xxxl that you order. I loved the color and had it been a smidge bigger I would have made it work but it just looked awful on me.


Love this dress!! My daughter looks amazing in it. It is nicely tailored and well made.


Absolutely adorable dress


The dress was too tight in the bust area. Definitely not a good style for C or D cup.


Runs a little small but pretty dress.


The dress is really cute, but you might want to go up one size. Overall, I'd buy it again in a different color.


Want zip due to not being sewn on correctly. Disappointed. Had to put in shop to get zipper replaced. ğŸ˜¢
