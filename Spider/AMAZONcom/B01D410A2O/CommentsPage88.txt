Beautiful Dress Love It


I am 5'2", 120#, 34 B and a medium fit me perfectly. Added the petticoat for fluff and the 50's style was a hit. Actually, the dress is so nice I will wear out to a nice dinner or to work on a dressier day (other than pants!)


I loved it.  I haven't wore it yet since it is short sleeves but it fit well when I tried it on. I wear size 12, purchased Large and it fit fine.


Love this dress! Bought the skull pattern, which is so sneaky subtle. Zipper is on the back on this one. Included fabric belt is removable, no belt loops on dress. A contrasting stretchy belt I had worked better for me.


Super Cute, fun dress. Ot is versatile, too. You can wear it to the office, party or anywhere in between.


Excellent all the way in every aspect.


Adorable. Washing instructions a little difficult as dry clean only, but that is no big deal. Beautiful material. Order a size larger than you wear as it fits small.


So pretty.
