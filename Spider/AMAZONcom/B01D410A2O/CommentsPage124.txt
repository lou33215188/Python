Super cute!! Fits as expected. I paired it with a petticoat for extra flair.


Not flattering on a full figured woman.  The waistline feel right on the belly button.  Material was also stiff so that when you raise your arms the whole dress rides up.  When you put your arms down the dress stays up at your chin.


beautiful dress fits perfectly!


This dress was so much better than I expected, it fit perfectly according to the size chart. I would definitely recommend this poduct.


Beautiful dress!


I got this for my friend for her bday and she loves it!


There was an issue with the zipper so it was returned.


Beautiful and perfect for Easter


The fabric looks very cheap


Fits great. Shoulders are perfect and larger in the waist;
