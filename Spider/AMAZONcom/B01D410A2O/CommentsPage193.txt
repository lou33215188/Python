In my opinion, this fits true to size. Buy a petticoat and you'll appreciate the beauty of this dress. The material is not bad at all. Can't wait to wear this in one of the holiday parties I got lined up!


this dress is beautiful and fits like a glove. i am on the 22 side of 22/24. it's beautiful. dry clean/hand wash only.


It wasn't exactly what I was expecting. The material was very stiff. It was alright for the price.


The dress was not as the picture and description said it would be


Lovethe style,  fit & quality!


The material is very thin!


Beautiful. Size was not consistent with the large Iâ€™m accustomed to.


Purchased for my mother. She likes the dress however, a size up would have been best.


I love it! It fits great....will buy again.


They look awesome thank you !!!
