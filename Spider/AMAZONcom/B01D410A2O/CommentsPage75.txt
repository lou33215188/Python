130 pounds &5.2. Size M. Fits great.


Beautiful dress, but I bought it a size too big expecting the sizes to run small. Dress is true to size. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because I didn't want to wear a can can under it and the dress part, to me, had too much fabric.


Nice , well made for the price.. runs 1-2 sizes small if your top heavy... delivered sooner than I expected


I normally wear a small. I got a small and a medium. Small fits perfectly. A little long on me but I'm 5'0" which is kind of expected. Very cute dress!


nice for price


Product package is not good and it came damaged. The size is also too small not what I expected


I like it


I love the color and the size fits perfectly.  I received it two days after ordering.


Instead of medium, as a size 10, I chose size 12. Great fit and bright, summer yellow. love it.


I am very pleased so far with this!!
