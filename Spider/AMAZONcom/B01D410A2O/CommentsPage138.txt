Absolutely perfect for my 10 year old granddaughter's chorus concert.


The dress is good quality.  But the it is somewhat small even when you followed their size chart.


ordered 1x was way too small more like a  size 10 or 12


Love the material and style


The dress is just perfect . No complain at all.


Zipper is not good quality.


Item shipped fast! Dress made me look bigger than I am. The style and color just wasnâ€™t for me.


Poor quality


The dress was very nice however; ran small.  I will not be able to wear it for what I needed it for.  Will consider returning it.


Loved the style and color. The dress was a little smaller than expected, but still fit.
