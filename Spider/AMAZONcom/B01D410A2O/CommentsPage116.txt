This was extremely cheaply made. Poor quality fabric and zipper. I returned it and would never recommend it to anyone else.


Fits perfectly. I usually wear a 2x, so I ordered up at 3x. The only thing thatâ€™s not perfect is that the belt is too short to tie into a bow like in the listing.


Beautiful in every way!!


Wish it came with a solid color belt,that's the only thing I would change.


I'm a size 14 in pants and a xxl fit perfect.


Love it, wore to take family pictures and received so many compliments. Dress is totally worth it


Beautiful dress. I had to go up a size.


My product came with a broke zipper. Needed to have the dress for a banquet. I do not recommend buying.


I ordered the blue dress and the color is perfect. The fabric is thin but I bought a petticoat and solved the problem. The dress came before expected and in good conditions. Overall I like the dress.


I would recommend ordering a size or 2 up. Use the sizing guide. other than the fit it is a super cute well made dress


Beautiful dress and perfect fit!


Wow. This dress is so cute -- It fits perfect! I purchased the red/black polka dot for Christmas along with the petticoat -- can't wait for the holidays to wear it.
