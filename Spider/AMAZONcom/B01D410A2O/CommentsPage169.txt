I went by the Amazon size chart not the one included by the pictures and that was a better fit. It can be worn without the petticoat but it definitely looks a lot more elegant like in the photo once you use the volume underskirt or petticoat (not included but in my opinion worth the buy). I love the dress, the color, style and fabric are just what I wanted. It's comfortable and I got lots of compliments.


I felt like a blooming rose. I love my dress.


I absolutely love this dress!
