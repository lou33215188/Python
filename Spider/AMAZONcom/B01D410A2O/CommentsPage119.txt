Just received my dress, tried it on right away and was floored by the fit, the fabric, and the quality of the sewing. Will probably be buying it in as many colors as I can. Love it!!!


Fit perfect arrived on time and it was beautiful.


Purchased for my mom.  It fit her well and complemented her skin tone.


The dress fit fine and was well made.  My daughter loved it and we had a lot of compliments at the father-daughter dance.  Thanks!


I really like the dress. I ordered a size larger than I usually wear because other reviews stated it runs a little small and I am very happy with the fit.  It does need a good ironing when you receive it.


Great dress, exactly right for the time period and very comfortable and well fitting.


Great dress but has to be dry cleaned. Be aware of that but very cute!


This dress is very nice,I like that.my husband alsoğŸ˜�
