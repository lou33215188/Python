Great quality and perfect fit!! The price is great for the cutest dress ever!


Color and size just as expected, love this dress!


Fabulous!


Adorable and a bit stretchy, fit wonderfully. The zipper only held out for a few wears though


Very cute vintage look. I paired it with a petticoat to give it a fuller look and it is adorable


Great dress! Looks great with a petticoat underneath.  Definitely order at least 1 size larger than norMal as this dress does run small.
