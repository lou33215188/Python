was beautiful on my daughter!! fit as expected!! nice quality material. looks like picture!


I LOVE this dress. I originally ordered in black and then decided to try the polka dots. Wore it to a wedding with red heels and it was a big hit!! It's super light and comfortable.


This is extremely small.....I wear  2x an d  i order a 3x. Still way to small...order another dress an d ordered 5x. Still doesn't fit....Loved both dresses but too too small.


The fit was perfect. I am 5'8" and normally wear a 14 to 16 and ordered the 2X. It fit like a glove and I love the look. Wearing this to the opera coming up as I have always loved this style but never have tried it. Glad I did. I will be ordering a few more in different colors.


Love everything about this dress. The color and pattern. It fit just right.


Dress fit perfect , although had some problems with the zipper.  It's a bit hard to unzip, was worried it would break if pulled to hard.


The color of the dress is just as beautiful and rich as it is in the picture.  The dress fit just as ordered.


I like it, it fit fine, just didnt feel comfortable in it. I returned b/c It just wasnt for me personally doesnt mean it wouldnt be for someone else. I went another route from the same company and loved and kept the dress for the wedding i will be attending in May.


Fits perfectly on me (and I'm a very small person). The fabric is a bit on the thin side (if you're wearing bright colors underneath, it may show through) but other than that, it's perfectly fine!


THIS DRESS IS AN ABSOLUTE WINNER!!!  I am a plus size woman (18-20) and I had to but a 3 XL and it fir perfectly.  I got many compliments on the look and the style of the dress.  I have purchased the blue and white, brown and white, & black and white.  I will be purchasing more colors soon.
