Love the product, would for sure by it again.


The dress is cute, but the upper part and the arms are cut really weird. I got a small and the dress fits, but it was tight across the chest and I could not move my arms. The material was a little cheap too.


Bit to short for 5'8" women


I was surprised by the nice weight of the cotton fabric. I was disappointed by the weird fit: way too big in the shoulders but fine at the waist and hips. The waistline seemed to dip from back to front too.


not worth the money


Felt like very cheap material when putting on. Very stiff and wrinkled. Stays wrinkled. I expected a little more from the fabric. Yes it's stretchy and somewhat comfortable, but I thought it could've been better. Still iffy on how I feel about the dress.


I’m 5’3, 117 pounds, 34A and I got an XSMALL it’s perfect


It's a very cute dress, but it was a little too large in the bust for me. It also wrinkles kind of easily, but overall, I think it's worth the purchase.


lovely fit and quality


It fits great. But... the back part by the neck is cut way too far up and hits the back of my head. Had to get it adjusted professionally and that cost more than the dress. Next time I will by a low cut in the neck line
