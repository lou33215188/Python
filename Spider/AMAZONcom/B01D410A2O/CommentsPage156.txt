Great value and fits as expected. I will be using to wear as Minnie Mouse!


Totally impressed! Love the stretchy material!!


The dress was the perfect color. Sadly the bust area was very small, so it was returned.


Please with my purchase!


Absolutely love the dress. Fits great makes me feel great while wearing it. Very comfortable and fun dress.


Love it! Will order this dress in different colors.


Love It!


I’m 5’5 and 138 pounds and the medium fits perfect?


It just didn't fit me in the shoulders, but the rest of the dress did.


Great fabric. Beautiful dress, just a bit too snug.
