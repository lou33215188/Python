I'm 5'3", 170 lbs, Bust 41, Waist 35 and Hips 43. The hem line comes just below my knee. I ordered the Royal Blue. It's vibrant, gorgeous and appears just as it does online. The material is a little thinner than I would have wanted but comfortable. It's form fitting and a little tight in the bust. I probably should have gone up one size for a little more room. It flatters my curves and hides my stomach. This is a great versatile dress for work or casual wear. And the price is great too. Photos coming soon.


love it!!
