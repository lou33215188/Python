Adorable dress. My daughter used for a 50s theme party but you could wear it anytime. Itâ€™s very nice!


I love this dress and I plan on ordering so many more I ordered an xl thinking to myself what have I done I should have gotten an 2xl but I ordered without looking over the details again but the xl worked perfectly!!!! I was concerned but not anymore and thanks to all those that took pics and left details as to the size.. My dress size varies but the xl was excellent


Just received this dress. I ordered the one with a black background with the red cherries and green leaves and white flowers.


Very well made.


A tiny bit on the stiff side, not a flowy material, but very pretty.


I wear a size 12 jeans pants and 14 dresses.


I ordered XL and fits correct. Not snug at all.


I am almost 5.7 and weigh 185 pounds.


The length hits my knees.


A good buy.


Fantastic dress! A bit sheer with the white and blue flower print but not bad at all. I would highly recommend it.


I purchased a 3X in purple and it is beautiful.  A little snug on the top, I am a 38D, but it looks great. I am 5â€™9â€� and weigh 230lbs.  I wear it with a black petticoat,  a narrow black belt and black heels,


loved it.. received a lot of compliments. I ordered a size up and im glad I did. I have enough room for comfort and it wasn't big..im about a l/xl and I ordered an xl


I love the color on this. I got the green one. It was a bit big on me, but I think the smaller one may be too small.


The belt works well for that.


The cut is great, a nice, plain but vintage look that you can dress up or down.  I'm worried the fabric will wrinkle quickly.  It's thin and kind of starchy.


Lovely dress! I ordered a large. I normally wear 10-12 in dresses and if fits perfectly.


Fit as I expected. An XXL fits like a size 14. Super cute. Took it out of the package and wore it to work.
