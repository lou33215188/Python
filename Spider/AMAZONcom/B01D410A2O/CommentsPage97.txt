Thin material so wrinkles very very easily


It arrived way sooner than expected, it is a great fitting dress; I got the petty coat to go with it in black and it really completes the dress! Very happy with the quality of the garment!


She loves it! Fits great.


This was a gift for my daughter, she absolutely loves this dress, and we are trying to find more....


Nice for the price.


Beautiful dress for Spring


Love my dress. Must buy


Very cute dress!  Fits great, plenty of space in the shoulders (which is the whole reason I moved up to medium).  However, the print is not what is shown in the photo.  All the dots are the same size.


I just received this dress in the mail.  It fits perfect.  I measured myself and used the sizing chart. This dress is very flattering.  I will be buying another.


The zipper gets stuck right at the seam in the waist. I returned it.
