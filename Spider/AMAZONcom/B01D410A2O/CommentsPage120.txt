Waste of money n time. ....


Made the perfect scarlet overkill


I like this dress very much.  It was somewhat small but fitting.  I just like a little looseness in my dresses.  Overall, I would buy a similar dress.


The dress is ok, but they make it seemed like it comes flowy opened like the picture a little dissapointed


Not good material. It looked unflattering. Way too much space for cleavage area especially for a size small


Super cute dress. My daughter is a size 12 and she wear this in a 2xl


Great fit!!! Beautiful dress and itâ€™s very comfortable.


The color is very vibrant and it does get compliments. A STAND OUT!


Actually made nicely. I didn't read the material before purchasing.  But it's still nice soft material.  Definitely need the petticoat.


Great dress. Fits as expected. Does wrinkle somewhat easily, but material is nice (and has a little give). Purchased in another color.
