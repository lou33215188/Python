Runs extremely small in the chest area. I wear a 22 and size 44 DD the 3X is way too small in the chest area.


So chic! I love the style and the color.  It may look pink pink but it is actually slightly more on the side of coral.


This is a beautiful dress. The waist is a little small but it is a little uncomfortable in the arms and waist.


It was very cute but way to small. It was my fault. I didnâ€™t read his you need to order sizes up.


i feel great in this dress and receive so many compliments when i wear this dress. it does need to be dry cleaned and ironed but that's ok!


Love the dress... I just didn't pay attention to the fact the belt/bow isn't attached. Have to make sure to steam, and didn't realize it was also dry clean only.


Lovely dress! I was nervous about sizing but it seems I picked right. I got a M for the dress and I'm 5'2'', 126 lbs. I chose the size based entirely on my waist, and it fits lovely. I am going to have to take it in in the bust, but I anticipated that because I'm small-breasted, and it looks like the darts will be easy to adjust.


It's okay wasn't the best dress in the world it worked for what I needed it for which was a funeral


I absolutely love this dress. Fits perfectly. Can be worn all year


I love the material. I love this dress. I got lots of compliments when I wore it to church. I bought a petticoat to go under it. The dress looks nice. I bought a large.  Usually I wear a medium, but I've also put on a little weight. The dress fits perfect. I'm glad I got a large.
