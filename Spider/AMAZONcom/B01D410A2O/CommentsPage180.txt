Larger than expected, but very quick delivery.


I love it.


Great dress! Get compliments all the time!


Fills well. Looks great. Wish they had more styles...


It's so pretty! I will be ordering more colors soon.


It is stiff, dull, not soft and I don't like the cut of these purple ones, does NOT look like the dress that is displayed. Maybe it just needs ironing! I purchased these dresses for my praise and worship team. Since they are mostly TEEN girls, they said that these are some ugly dresses lol, they are NOT ugly to me, but I can honestly say that it is the worst of ALL my MANY 1950's vintage dresses. This material is so cheap and thinner than ALL of my other cotton vintage dresses!


This is a great value. Fit true to size.


Loved it!


Love it!
