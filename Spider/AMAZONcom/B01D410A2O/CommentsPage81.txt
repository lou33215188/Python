The dress is not made in the best of quality. The material is too thin. The color is pretty.


Lots of compliments. Very comfortable.


Dress fitted but was a lil snug in the breast area i wear a 40DD and had order a 2X i would say go like two sizes up from your regular XL just for comfort if your big breasted because normally i wear an XL BUT GET A 2X FOR COMFORT AND A PETTIE COAT FOR EXTRA POOF


I'm 5'8" and 175lbs, and a 36D, and this dress in large fit me perfectly. Is very wrinkly after washing, but was a perfect dress for a retro party I attended, and I will likely wear this dress all summer too!


Ordeed a small for my 13 year old 115 pound daughter. Fits her perfect. She says material is stretchy.  Belt is seperate piece which  I never read before. Perfect for wedding in March!


The material doesn't lay very smoothly and it's really baggy on top.  If you're busty, this will be a great dress.


So cute! The cut on the neck is a bit weird but I wore a shawl with it and it looked just fine.


Simply elegant....


Cheap fabric. I'd've returned it but it was too late since it was a birthday present.


Love the dress!!!!  Fit was as I expected and near perfect.  Just a little taking in at the bust but I expected that.  Pairing the dress with a full petticoat and some funky 50's style jewelry.  Can't wait to wear it for my 50's event!
