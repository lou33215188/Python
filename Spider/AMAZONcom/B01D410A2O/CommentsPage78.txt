perfect! I loveit it give an hour glass figure ! for a big girl like me it cute !


Got it for this weekend and I will be buying again


Everybody love the dress the keep asking were I got it from, I told them I got it from amazon, they were suppose. I love wearing the dress perfect fit. I purchase a different color soon.


I ordered this dress in 2 sizes larger than what I normally wear and it fits great. I am size 14/16.


The dress is beautiful and very well made, but mine didn’t come with a belt, and I don’t have time to return it and get a new one before the party I’ve bought this dress to attend.


Somewhat small around the mid chest


Prefect fit for my daughter


The chest area was very generous in fabric, not ideal for a medium size girl. Nice quality


Absolutely adorable dress but very tight in the rib cage area. I am 5’1 and 110 lbs and purchased a small. I would have exchanged it for the size up if the dress wasn’t extremely see through.


I absoulty love this dress! The fit is amazing and the fabric feels soft and sturdy. I want more!
