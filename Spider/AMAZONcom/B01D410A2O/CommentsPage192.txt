Gorgeous dress. Thank you! Size runs small so but it larger than you normally would. Great customer service!


I got it I green 3x ...Normally wear 22 Wayyyy too small


Love Love Love this dress. I purchased an XS and it's a perfect fit and oh so classy. I received so many compliments!


It's a good dress. Fit and style were good; however, the wrinkles are VERY difficult to iron out. I spent more that an hour trying to get all the wrinkles out but I couldn't.


I ordered 2, they were for my daughters for a wedding. One fit my older daughter great. The other was too large but was delivered dirty. It had white and oily spots on the top of the skirt. Not impressed.


THIS DRESS WAS MARVELOUS!!! I was so nervous about the color, but it turned out BEAUTIFUL!! The chest was just a tiny bit to big, but I'm small chested and expected it to be, still looked wonderful!! I'm probably going to buy more.


My daughter loves this dress


I purchased the black red rose and I am not sure the picture did it justice, the color seems brighter and richer in the picture but some how the actual color of the dress is much paler.


I absolutely love it!!!


Dress not as shown. Fabric was thin and of lower quality. The skirt fell flat; it did not have the natural flare as was expected.
