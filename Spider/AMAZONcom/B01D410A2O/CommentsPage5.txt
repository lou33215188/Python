Love, love, love this dress! Iâ€™m 5â€™4 and 125lbs and ordered the navy in a size small. I usually wear between a 2-4, and sometimes a 6 so I was worried about the bust being too small, but it fits like a glove! I read through so many reviews of those of similar size and went with my gut. Will definitely be buying in different colors!


*Update


I wore the dress for 10+ hours, and aside from it wrinkling from constantly moving and sitting down on it, I still have no complaints. Washed it in cold water, hung it to dry and cleaned up just like new.


This dress fit beautifully, I received so many compliments on it, it was a Mother's day gift from my Mom. I'm 5'8 and wear a 16 comfortably so I ordered a 2XL. I have the short length petticoat on under it to give it a balloon look but not so puffed out.Very light cotton material, great buy for the money.


This is the best dress I've ordered thus far. I am extremely satisfied with dress. I sacrificed and cut the top layer from my petticoat. The big poof was an injustice to this dress. The ruffles on the dress fall perfect and looks exactly like the photo with a single layer petticoat. Thank you dressystar.


I ordered an XS green dress. The green's a cross between kelly green and evergreen and is a bit more muted than I'd hoped, but it's still an okay color. And yes, you will absolutely need an iron if you own this dress.


For reference, I'm 5'5", 105 lbs, 34A, 25" waist, and 35" hips.


I'm giving the dress 3 stars because the boob area is massive and this dress will definitely need to be resized if I decide to keep it (the waist will need down-sizing as well). After trying on the dress with my normal bra, I put a gel bra on that bumps me up to a C and over that wore a padded camisole. I was at least a D and still had a bit of room in the chest area of this extra small dress. This is great I guess if you have big boobs but are otherwise small, but most of us XS people aren't naturally like that. As others have mentioned as well, zipping/unzipping this dress by yourself requires mad contortionist skills. I can manage it, but it's a bit of a pain in the butt, especially with the padded bras on.


The pictures below are of me wearing the dress with my regular bra. The "air boobs" created solely by the fabric design surprisingly don't look as odd as one might imagine, but still, movement or the weight of a sweater smashes them down a bit awkwardly. I wasn't sure whether I should go with or without the petticoat before purchasing based on other reviews, so I've also included a picture for comparison of me wearing the dress with the Retro Dress Petticoat, 25" Length Underskirt for Women JS56-1 (S,Black). It was too long and far too poofy for my liking, but others may prefer that look. I've already got a bit of a butt, so the petticoat was just too much in my opinion (my backside looked like I was going for the 1800's style butt-bump). It's difficult to see the toulle sticking out about 3" from the bottom of the dress since it blends-in with the blanket on my bed, but it's there if you look at my legs. I'm sure you could cut it back if it's not your thing either.


What an amazing dress!  I love the cut, the fit, the fabric, everything!  The sleeves are a little restricting but I have large shoulders so that's on me.  I'm 5'4" 120# and a size 4/6 and the small fits perfectly.  Enough skirt for a petticoat.  Love the high neckline too.  Will buy more!


I wore this dress for a work event and it was as perfect. Very modest length and appropriate for what I needed. I did have trouble with it riding up, but it wasn't too big of a deal. The sash isn't big enough to tie a bow on the size I got. I'm 5'8'' and 170 lbs. Size XL


This is an awesome purchase, if taken in the correct perspective. First, the price is by far the biggest plus and also an indication of what your expectations of this dress should be. Second, the dress is well made and comes with a sash for you to tie into a bow. I want to stress that you have to know how to tie a bow if you want the dress to come close to what you see in the picture. Third, be forgiving regarding the actual color of the dress. I ordered purple and it does not look nearly as deep purple as in the picture (or even other people's pictures) for that matter. Overall this is a good buy for someone who is looking to increase their dress inventory. It will require ironing, so not something to just throw on and go.


I purchased a petticoat to go under it and I love, love, love the effect. I plan to purchase more of these dresses for your every day events. You can definitely accessorize it up and create a more dramatic look. If just purchasing the dress and wearing nothing under to give it volume, know that it will not look like the picture. The dress falls on your body and has no lining.


I am usually a 16 in dresses, 38DD and purchased a 3X. It fits perfectly to me, which means fitted from the waist up.


I used this dress as a costume (Minnie Mouse) and loved it. It was very comfortable to wear through Disneyland for an extended amount of time. I'm definitely going to purchase a solid color to add to my dress collection. There is a bit of stretch in it to fit a larger variety of body types - and also accommodates those (like me) whose weight fluctuates depending on the time of month. ğŸ™ˆ


I'm 5'2" and between 122-127lbs, and the length comes a couple inches below my knees. I have fairly muscular arms from packing around a 30lb 15 month old son, and the sleeve holes were not at all constricting for me.


I do want to note: after washing and drying on a regular cycle, it does need to be ironed. The dress isn't super wrinkly, it just doesn't have as crisp of a look, especially the hem. The belt does come out of the dryer wrinkly. I don't mind ironing it though, I like it that much.


The dress is gorgeous : it is beautifully cut and fits perfectly. I'm 5'2 for about 120lbs (size S bought), the hem arrives just below my knee without the petticoat. The waistline of the dress is above the normal waistline and is around the lower ribcage.


It has been washed and has not shrunk in the process. It definitely needs ironing before each use. I haven't noticed it going up when walking and it definitely didn't catch on my tights. So glad I bought 2 of them in different colours!


Love the fabric
