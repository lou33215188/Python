This dress was purchased for my 16 year-old daughter. She is 5'3", 32, 26, 31 125lbs with a long torso and the small fit perfectly. The length hit right at the knees. We paired it with a 24" long petticoat, size small. The fabric is of nice weight to wear year round. She is totally in love with it and wants more!


Not perfect but it's very beautiful. I think it worth the price.


Ordered for my 12 yr old.  Looking for a dress that wasn't too grown-up and modest; we were both pleased!!  Followed the sizing chart and the small size fit her perfectly.  Will definitely order more in the future!!


The  size small dress was beautiful, unfortunately it was to small for my wife. Just couldn't get the dress zipped in the back. My wife is small framed about 120 pounds but still didn't fit.


I wish the material was a little softer, but the style is great!


Cute dress but done in a flat cotton fabric. Wrinkles easily. No sheen. No starch or sateen feel.


This dress is quality material and fits great


The zipper sticks a bit at the waist where the skirt meets the bodice. Nothing a little beeswax can't fix.


I bought this dress for my girlfriend last week. First time she wore it out she got about 100 compliments. It fits her perfectly.


I love this dress. It fits perfectly. I would buy it again if I had to. Theyou use good fabric material for this dress. I received so many complaints for wearing it.
