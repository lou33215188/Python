Very nice product, my wife really loves it.  Very modest length (She's 5'2") hits top of the calf.


My daughter loves this dress! It fits nicely amd looks gorgeous. It arrived on time also (very important for last minute shoppers. Lol)


The bust is way too big. It pooched, the neck line gaped. The waist is nearly too small. Very weird sizing. I read other reviews saying the sizes ran small, so I ordered an XXL. My daughter is 11! I don't even wear an XXL! I returned it. Very disappointed. 1 star for the ease of returning it.


We knew to order a size larger, this fits my wife very well. Very pleased!


Love it and it is well made.  The fabric hung well and the size was accurate. I would recommend this dress.


Bought it for my daughter for my husbands retirement party. She hasn't worn it yet but she's tried it on and it fits really nice! I bought a size small, she normally wears a juniors size 3. Will post pics later. Very true to size. A little long on her but I was expecting it. Planning on getting a petticoat to put under.


Product is not US sized. My wife wears a Med/LG off the rack from Macys, Belk and JCP.


Sizing was on point once you follow the size chart. Beautiful dress and excellent quality. Very nice packaging as well.


I ordered the size based on the bust measurement and it fit perfectly.


My daughter loved it.
