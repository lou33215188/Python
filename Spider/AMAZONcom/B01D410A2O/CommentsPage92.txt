Absolutely Adorable!


Very nice dress.  It was difficult to pick a size based on the chart but I went larger so I could always take it in.  Fabric is nice and it will need a slip


I order a XXXL I usaly were a XL and it was still to small. This dress was not made any one with Boobs it might  have got if I wasn't as gifted lol.


Cute dress, but wish it was a little longer. My daughter won't have much wear in it. The dress looks much prettier in the picture.


The skull print is my favorite dress if all time!!! however, the zipper catches in one spot every time (after maybe 5 times of wearing). i have to get someone to zip it up and it takes some time and patience.


I wore this on the plane and I was a **KNOCK OUT**!! I pared it with a black shrug and a cute open toe bow black heel


Very pretty dress and it's scratches a little bit to help the fit


Love this dress.


I bought this dress for my mom and she loves it. I order her an XL because her waist line is a size 35. The dress fits perfectly, she has a little extra breathing room which is what she likes it fits and looks beautifully on her. I would order from this seller again.


Cute dress. Quality good for the price. Wore it with a black crinoline pettyskirt to a 50's themed party. Great for dancing. Took away one star because it ran a little small.
