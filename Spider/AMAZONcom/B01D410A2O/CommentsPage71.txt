Daughter loved the dress.  It is well made and is flattering on.


Love these dresses!


Perfect


The dress is a pretty color but the material feels very cheap.


was a bit big for my daughter.


I'm so in love with this dress & need every color! It showed up as expected, but at 9:30pm. This bad boy fit like a glove. I felt like doing my makeup and cleaning house, like a proper 50's wife! Fabric is good & the cut is flattering. This dress is on point!


Didn't like the material.. Too much cotton and not enough spandex like the yellow, white and black vintage dress.


Very nice and comfortable dress.


Ewww looks like a bad costume


Beautiful dress in person. Nice weight material and perfect knee length. Just enough stretch if you need it.  Love this dress.
