Nice fit.  Thinner fabric than I expected, but works fine.  Good value for the money.  From a large busted woman the 3xxx fit well.


Love this dress! It's a classic and gorgeous!


The size chart is accurate.


Dress is very cute but it is cut at a smaller size so get the dress in 1 or 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear


Really cute and fits to size, I’m 5’4 and 140 and ordered a medium and it fits great. The only downside is the zipper is awful and almost impossible to zip past the middle seam.


A wonderful, stylish dress. Did not expect much, when we ordered it. But it looks great!


Very flattering style!


The dress itself is beautiful but the sizes are not true to size. I'm a x-large - 2xx at any store I shop at. I ordered a 3xx to be on the safe side and it's way to small, looks like a medium that's labeled 3xx.


Love the fit and fabric of this dress.  Pursuant to earlier reviews, I ordered up one size and the dress fits perfect.


Adorable dress and well made.  Pleased with purchase.  Daughter wears a size 2 and small fit well


Great stretchy fabric. Fits me, by a little snug. The sizes run small IMO, but the quality is good and the dress is adorable and flattering :)
