Great dress. Light but not sheer.


A beautiful dress. I did buy a puffy slip for it.


This dress looks so cute on. I received so many compliments whenever I wear it. I'll be ordering more colors.


Love the color! Fit was a little loose in the shoulders and arms, but otherwise perfectly!


Good quality


My wife loves it, sized as expected and looks great


The dress felt like it was made of a cheaper material, almost like a tablecloth and as a little small, but I do adore the way it looks.The zipper was a problem too.The stitching on the zipper was messed up and had to be cut to avoid the zipper from getting caught on the seams.


I'm not sure how some people got such a good fit out of this dress. I'm 200 lbs and typically wear an XL, but read it was a bit small so I got XXL. It was snug in the middle and awkwardly big in the neckline. I thought (and my husband agreed) that it looked like dressy scrubs.


A good dress, just a little big in the chest area.


Perfect fit, and the description was spot on. Highly recommend the tutu under skirt, it really added a pop for flair.
