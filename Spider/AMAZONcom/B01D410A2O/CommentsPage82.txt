It fit my mom a little tight but still looked great on her!


Adorable!  I used the provided measurements to decide on the size and it fit perfectly. I bought a new petticoat for underneath it, and I got a ton of compliments. Unfortunately, it does have to be ironed each time after washing. I hate ironing, but I love this dress!


I weigh 215lbs and my height is 5’7”. I ordered this dress in a XXL(2X) for a church function. The delivery was perfect and it looks exactly like I expected it to. I was a bit worried about the bow that was on the picture but I was relieved that it was an optional ribbon.


I think it runs true to size. I read someone else comment and it said the dress runs small and it doesn't.


This dress was purchased for my 15 year old daughter and looks fabulous.  Absolutely stunning.


This is a nice dress. I usually wear a size 2 or 4, however I ordered a medium and it fit well. I am very pleased with this purchase. I gave it a 4 star only due to the somewhat small sizing but I do recommend this highly.


Love the flirty feel.


It was for my niece and she liked it


Embarrassing.. The zipper broke during I wear in the wedding party. I wonder if I can get money back.


Beautiful just a bit small.
