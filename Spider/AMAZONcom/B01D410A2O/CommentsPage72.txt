There was a horrible odor on this dress that 2 days of airing out didn't put a dent in. I didn't even try it on because I couldn't get past the smell. Cute concept though.


Just like the photo. Paired with a red leather belt and black petticoat. Compliments the shape of the dress and gives an authentic rockabilly feel.


thin material but if I was smaller would be perfect


Love the materials and love the fit!


Absolutely love this dress,  gonna order in different colors so cute!


Way smaller size than advertised!  Fits more like a size 14 or 16 women instead of the 3X purchased and advertised.  Cannot give it to person it was intended for due to sizing problems. However, the dress is very cute and will be giving it to a size 14 women instead.


I love this dress & want it in every color. I was worried about it being too small but it actually fit perfectly. I read one star reviews and people say sometimes the zipper messes up. Iâ€™m hoping that does not happen but so far so good.


Fits well, I wear it with a petticoat and it is just as cute as the photograph.


The material is cheap, and the fit is okay but I would buy bigger than what you normally wear.


So pretty!!!!!! Love it.
