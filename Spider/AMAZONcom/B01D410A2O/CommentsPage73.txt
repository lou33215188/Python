Fits perfect!!!  Very comfy.


I always wear an 8 and the medium fit perfectly - snug at the middle but flares out just right. I'm 5'11 and this was still long enough to get to the knee.


Loved the material. Wasn't expecting a belt. I got my normal size of 3xl but maybe I'm bloated but it's kinda snug across the chest area. Wearing it to my 1st Kentucky Derby so I got time to drop 5 lbs ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚


I purchase this dress for a sorority event. At first I was not sure about purchasing this dress. It arrived in a very timely manner and it fix perfect.


Too small and cut for someone without boobs.


Was not what the picture showed. Quite disappointed ğŸ˜”


very good


The cut and style are even better than the picture. An incredibly well made and classic looking dress.


All i really wear during the summer to work is dresses,so this is amazing.


Brought for my jr bridesmaids. They fit perfectly!
