Fabric is thin enough to be seen through and requires a lining but other wise beautiful the fit is perfect


This dress is wonderful. Well made with a good structured cloth. I'm very happy with my purchase. I just ordered another ,only in blue!!


It's a pretty dress.  It fits very small so you have to order twice what you would normally order.  It has a very tiny waist.  I had to return it unfortunately.


Nice for the price.  The fabric is thick and seems to be of good quality.  The fit was good


The small seemed rather big and I did not wear this to the event I wanted too as it looked more like a costume I would wear to a sock hop. Really long and a petticoat would be needed.


Can't fit into it yet, but too pretty to return.  Good incentive to lose some weight!


Wore to 2 weddings today....got compliments----comfortable.....but wrinkles easily...


Cute cotton dress, great quality and wonderful patten! Belt is not attacked like some dresses like to do.


My granddaughter wore it to her uncle's wedding and got lots of compliments! It fit perfectly and was very cute. Should have a link to a crinoline slip which is needed to make the skirt stick out like the picture. Otherwise it was perfect!


Received this dress, washed in delicate cycle, removed from wash and had 1 hole in the front and a snag in another area.  Bought this for my daughter's birthday but ended up throwing it away because of the hole which couldn't be repaired, so she never got to wear it. This dress was a waste of my money.
