True to size ,and very comfie


Dress fits fine. However the zipper does stick just a little bit.


Excellent fit. Drapes well over shoulders. Slightly stretchy fabric. Very good quality tailoring and finishing.


The material is really rough and the neckline too high. The size was no where near correct.


Sending back asap.


Not true to size, I bought this for a funeral and I couldn't fit into the largest size


Cute fit, very form


Fitting if you got curves

Super cute! but be warned that the bow must be tied yourself.
