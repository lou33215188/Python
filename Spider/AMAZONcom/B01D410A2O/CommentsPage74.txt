Very pretty looks nice on Happy with it


Dress was nice, but the zipper would get stuck.


I should have gone 2 sizes up. The dress is way too small so I'm stuck with a dress that I can't use


Wore this for my citizenship ceremony, and everyinebcomplimented me!  The dress is beautiful made and true to size.


Gorgeous dress, well made. Only problem is a bit of a stuck zipper but that may be my fault. Good weight fabric too. Sadly I ordered it too large not remembering I lost weight recently and have to return it and wait until my size is back in stock.


It came a lot faster than we expected


The The dress was just a little bit too big in the breast area but if it everywhere else for my wife we got the extra small size but my wife loves the dress still we plan on buying more from this company


nice


Perfect fit


VERY BEAUTIFUL DRESS.  SO MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WORE IT.


I bought this dress as a back up for a Christmas party. The other dress was 3x more. I bought a size bigger ( I usually wear a small ) and glad I did. I love the comfort and fit soooo much better. Looked amazing on. Was totally surprised. Wore this dress to the party and got so many complements.
