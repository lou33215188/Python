Love the color, but material was thin but price is well worth it even for just one wear.


Absolutely love it. I did wear a petticoat for more volume. Received lot of compliments about the dress.


Purty Dress got so many compliments


Cute but runs a solid size smaller than normal.


I am very happy with this dress.  I ordered another one in a different color.  I like the way that it flares even without the underskirt.


Very nice dress. Great quality. You will have to iron it every time you wear it.


Does not look as advertised and fabric feels really cheap. (To be expected a little from the price tbh)


A very nice dress at a very reasonable price.


The material,  I thought it would have a much richer look,  but other wise the size fits great as expected


Made of a good quality, somewhat stretchy fabric giving it great movement. Very pleased!
