Amazing and beautiful. Fit perfectly! My daughter wore this to a swing dance. Couldn’t be happier with this purchase!


Fits like a glove! Love this dress! I have gotten lots of compliments on it and will definitely order again in different colors.


Great quality craftsmanship and fabric.


For a small price this dress looks so pretty. I am size medium and I ordered size medium.  Fits perfect.


Purchased as a gift.


The zipper in the back kind of gave out and won't zip up all the way after three times of wearing it.and its a little see through.


Cute but runs small in the bust area.


Perfect fit


This item broke before I even got to try it on. As I was zipping it up, the cheap zipper pull snapped right in two! Cheaply made!


I love this dress. It’ll the material is thin but structured. It fits perfect. I wore it to a wedding and it was a hit!


Love love love super cute the quality of the dress maker is so beautifully sewn I will be ordering more soon!!
