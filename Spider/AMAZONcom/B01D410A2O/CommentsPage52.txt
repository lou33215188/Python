I love this dress and it fits perfect....Love the color,,,, gives you a nice shape look... I order a XL ,,, fits just the way I like it


The material isn't very forgiving :3, but I loved the pattern! Unfortunately, it runs very small. I bought a 3X and it was STILL too tiny. I usually wear a 1-2X.


As described. More teal than described but that's a good thing.


I couldn't get enough of myself in this dress! Sooo flattering. Added to my favorites list in my wardrobe.


I could not have asked for a better fitting dress. I am very happy with this dress I will be buying more in other colors.


The yellow is not a soft yellow like in the picture but a bit more of a mustardy yellow.


I was very impressed with the fit,style and quality i do have a crinoline that i wore underneath mine which added fullness but not to the point where it was costumey,received a lot of compliments


Awesome dress & a favorite of my wife.  Just love the bow to tie!


This dress was nothing like the picture. It is even a different material than it looks. This is the only thing that I’ve gotten from Amazon that isn’t just what I needed but this just wasn’t at all like the picture. I still love Amazon though!


Gorgeous, tons of compliments! Wore the crinoline underneath and looked adorable. I'm 5'3" and 140 lbs - the large fit perfectly
