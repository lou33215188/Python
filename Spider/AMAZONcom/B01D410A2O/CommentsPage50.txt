Itâ€™s pretty, well-constructed and I love it! Pairing with a crinoline slip.


My daughter absolutely loves these dresses. This is the second one we've ordered and they are superb! Definitely can find wonderful Colorado and the price is SO right!!!


Dress just came today it was very nice but the zipper was faulty. The dress was not tight on me and I had a lot of room to zip up the dress but the zipper just kept getting stuck on the same spot and it wouldn't go up.


Love this dress. Got multiple compliments. Will order in another color.


Love the dress. Fits as expected and is cotton. Would recommend purchase.


I love the dress. It's a little snug, but I have time to slim down for my event


The dress is well enough made for the price. The fabric is fully opaque but a cheaper quality (not bad though).  The seams are well done and style is great.  It fit perfectly. Go by the chart they post!


Wore this for Christmas, and it was lovely. Washes and dries very well without losing shape.


Beautiful cut, fabric has a sheen and love the fit. But the belt should not have a center seam, make it hard to tie bow at the back.
