This dress was well worth the money. I'm 5'7, 120 lbs, and wear a 34D. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly. I feel like if you were flat chested you would have a hard time filling out the bust but it works great for me!


Perfect fit...so figure flattering. I wore this on a cruise and got time of compliments.  Looks gorgeous with a crinoline petticoat.


Beautiful dress. I felt beautiful wearing it. It was a little tight in the waist but luckily it is stretchy. Try the next size up.


I really like this dress. I'm almost 8 months pregnant and it fits me so well. It does fit snug but a comfortable snug. IDK it's weird. I will be buying more. I believe it fits as expected. I think the size was pretty accurate. It also stretched a little which was perfect. Not too little not too much. ğŸ˜Š


This is truly a cute little black dress I purchased a petticoat to go under it. I've grain some weight so I'm in a 14/16 right now so I ordered a Xl I'm also a 38ddd it fit perfectly I'm planning to wear this dress to my nephew wedding.


I love this dress! It looks like it won't fit until I get it on. It fits great and looks great with the petticoat I also bought. So happy!!


I wore this for a New Year's celebration with a gold bolero and matching shoes. This dress is very comfortable.  it is a good buy!


Beautiful color and gorgeous silhouette, mine looked better without my tulle skirt underneath. HOWEVER the material wrinkled soooo easily.... After sitting down for a brief moment, it was so wrinkled in the back and front part of the skirt that I had to keep my jacket on the entire day. Not happy about that.


This was slightly smaller than expected and does not flare as depicted in the picture.  However I elected to keep it.


Looks really good. It is made well and the fabric feels great. If you want the shape like in the picture, you will need to wear a petticoat with it. I'm usually a size 16 and the 3x fit great. I need one in every color/ print now.
