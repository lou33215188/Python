fits funny


Perfect fit for a 1950s era play.


Dress too small for size ordered.


smaller than expected


Too loose in the chest. Had to get it altered


I even went up a size because other comments mentioned it being small, and it was still to small.


Love this dress! Itâ€™s adorable, fits great, and is super comfy! I get tons of compliments every time I wear it.


This dress came and looked nothing like the picture. I am disappointed and sending it back.ğŸ˜£


The dress is pretty. Doesnâ€™t fit me as I was hoping. Itâ€™s a bit baggy around the neck and. Little long for my height.


Beautiful dress! Fits perfectly. Size was according to my measurements. I got a petticoat to wear under it to give the skirt volume. I recommend this to anyone getting this dress. Can't wait to wear it this weekend!
