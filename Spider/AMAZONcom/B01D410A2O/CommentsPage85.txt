Really cute, bright and vivid color. Good quality material.


Not at all the color I expected. More orange/coral than pink.


looked very nice I ordered this for my daughter for our family reunion banquet and it was a hit.


I guess I am just in a weird size range. The 2x was too tight around the arms and midsection. The 3x looked boxy! I really want to love this dress because it looked good on so many ladies.


They dress is amazing. The material is great and the color is true to the picture.


Loved this dress. I bought a 3X and it fits perfect runs a tad bit small so make sure to go a size up but definitely will be ordering more.


OMG! This dress is adorable and fits just perfect, and not an inch more! There is no stretch to the fabric. I wear 12 to 14 so I ordered the large.


Thin material


couldnt pull over my head and i wear always a size 8 this fit more like a 2


super cute! Basic quality as far as it is just the dress, no lining.  But, the fabric itself is nice and soft.  It has some spandex in the fabric so it is a little stretchy which makes it comfortable.
