Not at all what i expected... if you are well endowed up top, donâ€™t get this dress because it wont zip up!


Beautiful, vintage looking dress!  I got so many compliments wearing it.


Dress is true to size I love it!


very cute ,bought the petticoat and the scarf and glasses set,  fits and looks great,  rocking  the 50's nite at the dance.


Fit was good, color as expected. It does come very wrinkled due to the packaging, but that can be fixed with a little ironing.


I love my dress


Beautiful dress but slightly large for my daughter. Unfortunately, there is no size small in stock or we would exchange it. My mom will take it in a bit and then she can wear it.


I bough a tutu skirt for it and it looks perfect, it fits perfect.


Glad I got a size bigger. Looks great and fits perfectly! Love it!


A perfect summer dress - lightweight, unlined and breathable.  Looks expensive once the wrinkles are ironed out.  The petticoat underskirt is a must.
