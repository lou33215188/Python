As long as you follow the measurement chart the dress fits PERFECTLY! Looks so good and is made from good material. Worth the buy definitely.


Great dress! I ordered a large and it fit well (5"3, 177 lbs). I wore the dress to a funeral and received so many compliments!!!


Just surprised how well this dress was made! Looking femine and classy in it!


And I took Size M, it sits perfect, I'm pretty busty 5'5", about 130 lb


good color but didn't fit well


The fit is very comfortable .


I purchased a 3X thinking that there would be more room in the bust since I usually wear a 2X and have a larger bust. In the end it will wear okay, but I wish it would have been more true to size.


Great dress, however, I am having to return the dress simply because it is to tight in the chest area and tooooo short in the back for a lady with a nice size rump.....


This dress is the perfect vintage find! The price is right and the fit is very flattering! There are no ruffles or toule underneath leaving plenty of options for a completely straight slip or a nice puffy skirt to give you a 50's look. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!


Very cute!


Really cute. Went by the size chart and just fits but feel if went up a size itâ€™s be too big. Zipper is really tough though.
