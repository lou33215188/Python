Beautiful dress. I bought an extra small for my daughter ( she’s 12) it was too big on her, but she is tiny. We are going to keep it. I would recommend it.


Bought the dress for low cost not knowing what to expect (my first Amazon order). Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the stiff fabric, cheap make & overall poor quality. Returned the dress the same day it arrived. I’ll be sticking with Macy’s for future dresses and will not be ordering clothing from Amazon again.


This worked beautifully in the Guys and Dolls production I did.  Very Satisfied!!!!!!!!


This dress is very cheaply made. The fabric is very thin and see through. Not happy, sent it back. Not worth the money.


This is a great dress. After reading the reviews, I ordered two sizes up but it was too big. I had to get it altered. I guess one size up would have been great.


I got tons of compliments on this dress!  The fit was great!  The material was hard to iron, but that is my only complaint.  Wore it to church and can't wait to wear it again and accent with other fun colors!


Did not hang properly on my one daughter and the material seemed more like curtain material.  Looks better in picture than in person.  So cute looking online.  Was sad it didn't work out.


This dress is well made.thought it would look and feel cheap but it fits great.bought in an Xl and it fits perfect.I am 5" 4 and wear usually wear a size 14/Xl 38DD.it drops midway on the knee and the arms for well. I will purchase again.


Very cute dress; the fabric and print are great.  I ordered a 3X, typically wear a 2X and I am struggling to get it zipped.  The zipper is also delicate.


I'm between a size 12 and ordered an XL based on the reviews and it a little big but managable. My friend gave me the same exact dress in print, size large and it fit perfectly. Will be returning the XL for a L.
