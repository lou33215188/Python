Lovely dress need to order one size bigger


Knew it would be smaller from the other reviews so I sized up! Will be beautiful for Christmas pics â™¡


This dress fits prefect and looks great on me.


Fantastic...wore it to a wedding and brought the house down...black vintage bag and black gloves....WOW


This dress fits perfectly and is adorable! I am 5'5", 135 lbs and after some debate with myself, I ended up ordering the small. I'm so glad I did, It's very comfortable:)


I ordered this to wear at a stage production we were doing, I ordered a petticoat separately. I love this little dress so much it is adorable! So much that I have worn it to church and know I will be my money's worth out of this one. I bought it as a costume and will keep it as a staple!


I bought this for my 11 year old grand daughter, she loves it!


Great material, beautiful color


Super elegant, well made dress. Love it


Love the dress. The petticoat that went with it was a little to long for the dress and had to alter. It would have been great if the petticoat came in petite to go with the average dress.


Great party or costume dress.  Good quality.  Even though the top was very small, tight fight, I was able to squeeze into it and the zipper was very sturdy.
