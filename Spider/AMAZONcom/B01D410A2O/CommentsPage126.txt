It fits, I have large breast and hips, my waist it's quiet small. The dress it's a bit large on the waist area but that's just because of the way my body is. The belt helps


Perfect for my Minnie Mouse costume :)


I love the style of this dress the material is nice and it has a comfort fit


The merchandise looks different in person.


❤️ Love love love


Fits about two sizes small by American standards.


Looked great on my daughter


Runs on the small size


Material and flare is not what I expected but fits well.


I really like the dresses I bought and the company overall. I got a 2XXL and it fits like a glove. Next time I buy, I know to go one size bigger just for movement and comfort.
