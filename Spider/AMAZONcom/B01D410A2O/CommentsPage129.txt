My granddaughter loves this dress


The fit was wonderful.  It was as if I had ordered a custom made dress.  Looks great and is a lightweight material.  Looking forward to purchasing another dress in this style!


This dress is beautiful. I'm 5'3 and my size is 34DD, is perfect.


The dress is a nice fit however, it promised to come with a belt as pictured that never came. Very disappointed when I opened the package.


I do like it, but it is small.  Does not fit size 18.


The dress worked out well for what I wanted to use it for! Thought it was a bit tight, but ok!


wore it for my grandmas wedding with all of my cousins matching and they were very great quality and overall very beautiful dresses!


It is a good dress. I was happy with the quality. The color wasn't quite what I was looking for so I returned it.


The dress was fine, I just didn't like it on me.


This is the first purchase that I have made online that actually fit the way it is supposed to fit! I love this dress. I will definitely order a few more in different colors!
