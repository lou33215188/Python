Exceeded expectations. Nice material.


Love it! Very good quality


I bought this dress for my daughter. It fit her perfectly. She's very picky. She absolutely loves it.


Great, flattering fit (bought for tween daughter). Great price, as well.


I love this dress so much! I am going to wear it for my husband'a work Christmas party in December.


Way too small


Very ptetty


Love the material, and dress. It was a bit large to me. I'm 5ft 1 and 125 lbs. am pear shaped so it was roomy in the bust area


The material was a little thin but overall good for the price.


This dress was horrible the material feels like paper not a good choice
