I bought this as a gift and even though she measured when it came it didn't fit. Disappointed in their instructions and sizing charts


Extremely disappointed with the make. The dress is beautiful itself and it fits perfect but while I was inspecting it, I realized the thread was already coming apart and now I'm afraid to wear it or wash it bc I think it'll just unravel all together


This Vintage 1950s Retro dress made me feel as cute as Sandra Dee and Doris Day all rolled into one (1)! Hugs my curves, lets me breathe and makes me feel just like a movie star!


Very nice and modest dress. I got a M and it fits me (I am 135 pounds). Nice length. Only thing I didnâ€™t like about it was that I had to hand wash and the color did come off a bit. But other than that it was pretty nice.


Beautiful summer dress. Light material but perfect for hot summer days. Fit was perfect and love the style and color. Price fantastic am ordering more.


Great product. I ordered several sizes small to 3X and it was perfect! I will definitely order again.


It's a nice blue , will require dry cleaning steaming as it's very wrinkle , it's a nice dress wanted the material a bit more elegant but I know what I paid so no complaints .


It fit a bit looser on me than I expected, but it's very cute and flattering.


Cute and lovey dress. Very 60ish and I love that style. It's light and it's wash and wear!!


This dress is very cute. I got a small fits perfectly  I'm 54 and about 120. My friend asked if I sent in my mesurments to get this dress.
