Light weight fabric with a little give to it. I love this dress!


This dress was as vibrant as in the picture. It was comfortable and I love it.


Absolutely love this dress and itâ€™s great material


El size  small que exactamente


I loved the dress but I did have to go up a size which made it a perfect fit. Everybody loved the dress as well.


The dress is even prettier in person


I should have brought a bigger size.


Great with or without the petticoat.


Based in feedback we keep it would run small so we went up a size ad it fit perfectly.


The dress fits fine around the waist but the chest and shoulders were to larger. Overall the dress looks and feels nice (especially the skirt).
