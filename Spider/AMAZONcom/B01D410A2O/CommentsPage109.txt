This dress is simply lovely looks plain but fits well nice cotton material looks with petty coat


The dress looks good, I wasn't a real fan of the material though. The material looked liked a school uniform material. it fitted great and the price was good.


Had to get an Easter dress last minute and this was perfect! The fit was nice and appropriate and waa comfortable!! Will be purchasing I'm other colors


I ordered one, and it was too small, so i ordered another one size larger. It's cute. For under $30....hey! I also ordered a crinolin to go underneath.


Dress was fine, but did not come with the belt


Lovely dress!  Fits as expected.


I love the fit of the dress however I was disappointed with the color not being as vibrant as the picture.


I love the dress.  Very well done and looks quite flattering on.  The only downside is that it is dry clean only, otherwise it would have been a total 5 star rating


Wrinkles if left folded but otherwise a great quick find for a last min prom need.


The dress was to big but itâ€™s beautiful
