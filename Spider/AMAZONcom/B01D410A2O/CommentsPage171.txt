Good stuff!


Nice dresse


Low quality wrinkly mess


The dress didn't have the straps around the waist to hold the belt in place...


Fits great! Love it!


Loved it!!! Fits as expected.


Love this dress so flattering


A little big in the top but otherwise beautiful.


Cute dress and style, but it runs small.


Great ..but I am 5.9 and could be longer
