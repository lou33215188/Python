nice fit, love the print, happy with dress


This dress is adorable! Bought it to wear as a halloween costume, but it would work well as a dancing dress or special occasion. I did end up returning it because it was too tight, although i expected that might be the case. Pre baby I was a size 2, 110 lbs, 10months later size 4, 120 lbs.5"4.  I tried a small. It did fit, I could get it zipped and everything, length just right, just a tad too tight in the middle. Returned for a different style and size M. For the price it was perfect! I definitely recommend this dress.


It fit great and looked great


The dress didn’t fit likenI wanted it too


Exactly as it’s pictured. Fit as expected


I recommend order a size bigger then you think, other then that the dress is beautiful and as describe.


Simply beautiful and fit a little snug but nice dress.


Dress was nice, nice thick material but the fit wasn't right for me.
