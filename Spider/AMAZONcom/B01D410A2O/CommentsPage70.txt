The dress came with zip off and also a dirty marks in the back by the behind of the dress.Not impress at all.would like a refund or a dress send back to me.


The dress is cute, but just does not look that great on me I think. I am only 5' tall. the torso comes very high to my neck so it just does not look right on me. I'm sure it would look fantastic on a tall person. I'm going to keep it for a costume rather than a going out or day dress which I was hoping for.


beautiful!


Great dress that can be dressed up or down!  I just wish it had pockets!


So cute! Love the color and the style.


Great fitting dress and made well.


I wear a size 20 in US sizes (230lbs, 5'3", size 40C bra) and purchased an XXXL in this dress.  I thought it fit well in the waist and hips but was too big in the top.  I washed it, hoping for it to shrink and all the right places.  It did shrink (only in the top and overall length) a bit and had I been intending to wear the dress as it was, would have been sufficient for a cute rockabilly sun dress.  (I, however, purchased it to be a part of a cosplay outfit so I actually ended up just cutting the top portion off anyhow.)


Cute dress and great material! Not too short or long :) if you wear a skater skirt underneath it can serve as a crinoline to puff out the dress a bit. Fits perfectly for size 0


Beautiful flattering fit.  Well made.


Good fit, color doesn't fade, I've bought a few of this style.
