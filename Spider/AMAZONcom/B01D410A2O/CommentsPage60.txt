Brought 3x, and it was way to small.material fine. Would have returned but don't want the hassle.


Nice dress,  bought  a size larger and it fits perfect! Using it for special occasions with dressy sandals.


Nice quality dress.  Size large fit me perfectly. My measurements are 38-31-41. I'm 5'7.


Sleeve shown in photo is not the sleeve on the dress.


OMG got so many compliments on this beautiful dress. I have a few diffeerent styles and colors and i am enjoying my new look


Fits really great. Looks so nice on. Have to make your own bow, it isn't stuck on there, you wrap around and tie it.


Bought it for my wife as a gift and she loves it.


The material is kind of cheap,  but worst of all,  the purple is Barney the Dinosaur purple.


This is my favorite dress now.  It is beautiful and feels good on.  I am trying not to buy them all, so cute.


Loved it so much I ordered another color!  Nice fit and very comfortable.
