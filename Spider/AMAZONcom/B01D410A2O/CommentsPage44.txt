My daughter loves thus dress! It is super cute and looks great on her. This fabric that this dress is made from seems very sturdy. Time will tell!


Oh my! I never thought I'd love this 50s look, but it is so flattering and the print distracts from any specific body faults I might think I have. I look good even my husband unprompted said her loved the look. ğŸ˜‰


I was not over the moon for this one upon receipt, because the material is soooo light.  So Light it rides up a little when I walk.  On the other hand, I got compliments from co-workers all day.  I was still receiving compliments the day after.  My co-workers loved it more than me.


I'm in love with this dress! I'm 5' 7" and where a 16-18 size and so I got XXL and it fit me perfectly! I wanted a dress that will transition between seasons and I think I found it. The cap sleeves are adorable and the belt could be used as a headband. I love it!


This dress is lovely!! At first I didnâ€™t know how it would fit so I just ordered a size I thought would work and it did! Usually itâ€™s a guessing game online when it comes to ordering my size but this time my â€œguessesâ€� worked. Iâ€™m 5â€™3 107lbs 34/24.5/26. They shipped very fast. The only thing I would recommend is to make sure you iron the dress once you receive it because it does come folded up.


I was looking for a dress for a semi-formal graduation event, and, as I'm allergic to rayon and polyester, my options were limited in the stores. I was very happy to find this dress (as was my skin!). It fit pretty well, was modest and classy, and flattered my figure. The material is nice too!


It is a little small but I have some medical issue's that cause swelling.  When that goes down my dress will fit!


I like this dress a lot.  The material is slightly thin and runs small.  I had to return it and order a medium.  The color is exactly as pictured.  Can't wait to receive the medium and hope it fits.


I adore this dress! It fits as if itâ€™s been made specifically for me. It is a good, sturdy material and comfortable. Very flattering and feminine. I own 3 in this style and I get many compliments. I highly recommend - especially for the price.


Pretty dress, just not for my body type, if you have broader shoulders this may not work for you, i have to return it.
