Runs slightly small then expected but still fit fine. This is a very nice flowing dress and makes for a great Minnie mous costume.


Very nice and lot of compliments especially the color


Fit perfectly. People said i look like a baby dollğŸ˜�.


Great fit. Great fabric!!!! Very very comfortable! Love this style dress!


I went by the measurements. However it wasnâ€™t accurate in my case. Way too small, but cute, so I was disappointed.


Very nice dress overall.  The only downside is that it does wrinkle up and needs to be ironed before wearing.


Great dress


One side of the top was too large and the other side was too small. Will be returning. Plus zipper was hard to zip up and down. Disappointed because I like the dress.


The dress is so pretty and bring the good shape, i choose the right size i like it so much and it very recommended for you


Excellent! Fits perfectly. My wife is very happy!
