Gorgeous color! Perfect fit! Many compliments!


This dress is so flattering! It could definitely be worn with a petticoat-plenty of material. A beautiful shade of green-not sure why it's called army green. I would definitely buy another item from Dressystar!


Perfect for 50's Party.  Looking forward to wearing it.


I love the dress and the color.


Beautiful dress and great quality. I bought the wrong size but plan to exchange for another one.


I bought this dress for my daughter, very beautiful dress.


This dress is amazing!


Love the pattern and material.  Unfortunately the bust area is still too big.  Had to return it.


True to color, very pretty.


Well made.


Flattering cut.
