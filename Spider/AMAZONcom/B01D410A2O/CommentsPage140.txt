I love this dress!


Very pleased with the fit and quality of the garment. The dress was just what we were looking for.


Dress fit perfect and came right on time. Easy to iron and wear


Great dress, perfect color, size is good.


Don't be put off by the fullness of the skirt.  It is not that full.  Drapes very nicely.


Such a cute dress and so reasonably priced! Fits great, as expected!


Order at least 2 sizes above what the site says


very pretty! fits great, and long enough. i'm 5'6 and it comes half way down my knees. thin enough fabric to wear in summer! will be buying in different colours!!!!


Loved it. Fit perfect. Lots of compliments at work as we celebrated the "50" day of school.


Beautiful dress but have problems with the zipper.
