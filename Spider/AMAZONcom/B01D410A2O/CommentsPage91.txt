Great color and cute style.  Arrived quickly.


Fit perfectly; my daughter was very pleased.


This dress was absolutely adorable. I wore it to my friend's wedding and received so many compliments on it. I would definitely order another dress but in several colors!!!


dress fits really well, the only con is that it is fairly thin fabric, not see through though.


Very pretty, arm holes not to tight.


The dress is cute for my daughter.  However very disappointed it arrived and is missing the bow.  One of the main reasons my daughter liked the dress.  Cannot get in contact with seller to get replacement.


Wore it for my college graduation and it was a little tight but nothing that a pair of spanx and sucking it in wouldn't cure. I looked and felt great which is all that mattered.


Liked style and Quality of Dress. Just uncomfortably small at top even though I measured myself several times before ordering This is why I hesitate ordering clothes online.


Great dress, stretchy enough fabric.  It hangs really nice.  I bought a black belt to go with it, I thought when I put it on the matching belt just got lost.  There are not any loopholes for the belt.


Good quality
