Not true to the size chart


Very cute dress and it fits nice


Fit was a little large in the top but otherwise it was great


I am very happy with this dress.  Love the fit, color and length.


Beautiful dress! I bought a extra large (I usually fit in a large) and it was perfect and comfortable. I got so much compliments on Easter. I plan on purchasing more in different patterns.‚ù§


Pretty, fitted at the top. Not thick at all, perfect for spring & summer!


Over rated! Fabric looks extremely dull and seems to have shrunk a bit after the first wash.


MY STYLE
