Just as expected! Used for engagement photos on the beach and it was just absolutely perfect :)


got so many compliments....semi stretch! love it


Sooo pretty, and fits like a glove. Well made. I'm beyond pleased with this dress!


Great dress, make sure you go buy the size guide.


Very cute on without the belt.


The dress is almost perfect, the hips fit nicely and the skirt is the perfect length. I am 5'6" and weigh 115 lbs. sadly it seems the bust was designed for someone who's got larger assets than myself, which is pretty much most people seeing as I'm a 32A. Over all the dress is fantastic


Fit is great but the green pictured is much darker, wish I would have noticed that the color name was "army green" even though the picture does not reflect that.


I liked the color and fit - looked just like the picture---although the fabric seemed a bit flimsy and VERY wrinkled ....but you get what you pay for. Green is my favorite color......so it was good for me. Not sure how it will wash, however.


I saved this dress for one of my granddaughters for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Fits perfectly too.


Wow could not do any better then this nice smooth fit :):)
