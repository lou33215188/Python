Its so pretty. The dress runs small I ordered one size up. Compliments my waist well


Love this dress. My only issue was the zipper had a slight curve in it, so getting it zipped was a bit of a struggle. Not sure if I will ever wear it again, but it was nice for the occasion! (work photo day)


I got so many compliments in this dress! I wore a crinoline slip underneath to add fullness. The fabric is stiff so it needs to be steamed before wearing. Definitely a great dress for the price.


this dress is so cute! My daughter loves vintage clothing and lives this dress. It looks adorable on her.


So cute!! I wear a petticoat with it and get lots of compliments!!


Awesome dress! Make sure you purchase a petticoat though to complete the true 50's look. Would also look great without the petticoat as an everyday dress. Very happy with this purchase!


fits small.


Great feeling fabric, great fit and comfortable!  Looks great too, what more could you want?
