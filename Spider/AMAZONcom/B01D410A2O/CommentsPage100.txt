I bought this dress for my daughter in law. She loves it.


I would have liked a material that wasn't so glossy but otherwise I am pleased with the dress with the exception of the hem line and bodice. See other comments.


Nice dress online. In person, Dress looks cheaply made. I measured myself and the dress is not true to size.


Love this dress.  Looks great on but does run a little small in the chest, which is no problem for me but if you have a little more up top you may want to go a little bigger.


Beautiful dress! Love the green color got lots of compliments on the color. Dress fit perfectly, will defiantly order in another color!


It fit great! It’s made of a nice quality material that is a little stretchy. I usually wear a 4-6 and am 5’3”, so I ordered a small and it fit nicely.


Very cute dress. A little tight in the waist.


I really like this dress however I was surprised to see it was too big in the chest area as I have a large bust.


I was super impressed by the quality of the material and the design of the dress! Really fabulous!


I didn't care for the polka dots on me, however, it fit my daughter nearly perfectly except it was a bit short waisted, otherwise, adorable!
