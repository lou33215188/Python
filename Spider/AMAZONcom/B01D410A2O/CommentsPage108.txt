Cheap material, badly made clothes, totally different from the picture. Not worth the price shocks!!


dress fit perfect and received compliments.


Wore it last weekend to a vintage retirement party and received a ton of compliments...it was comfortable and I danced all night!


I ordered a XL. I had to return it. I looked like a dress for a 5 year old.


Gorgeous dress. Perfect fit! I love it!

really comfortable and very very reasonable for the quality of the dress !


buy the slip to make the dress even more fun.


Im in love with my dress!!!! Very beautiful and confortable. Fit great.


This dress is very well made and cute for the price. Unfortunately I had to send it back because I think the color is too bold for where I want to wear it. You wonâ€™t be disappointed!


I received so many good compliments on this dress! It fits exactly as expected and it was SO comfortable. Overall a wonderful purchase and I will be purchasing from this company again.
