Love this dress! I ordered a medium (my usual size) and it fits well (I'm 5'8" and an athletic 155 lbs). The dress is very figure flattering and I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it. The fabric and dress are of good quality.


Perfect fit, will be ordering more


Love love love


Definitely a must have in the closet


I added lace for more lenght


Looks really cute, especially with a petticoat underneath. Decently made for the price.


Love this dress for work or for play. Perfection!


This dress fit nice and has a beautiful flare!


Beautiful dress, fits great and have a good quality.


Good material and fits well.  I wear a 12 and the large fit perfectly!  I see why folks buy the petticoat (I didnt) but it still looks great and it's really pretty.  Great dress for all occasions.


Loved how the dress fit. I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear though.
