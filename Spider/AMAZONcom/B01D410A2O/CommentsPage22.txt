We measured incorrectly, so it was slightly large.  But that was our fault.  Be careful in youâ€™re measurements and it should fit fine.  Not the best quality, but nice enough to wear in it in public without people noticing.  Probably wonâ€™t last as long as better quality clothes.


Ordered this as an Easter dress and the zipper defective.  Also the belt is not long enough to make the beautiful bow as it looks in the picture.  I gave it 2 stars because if did arrive on time as it said it would.  Now I have to go find another dress and return this.  So disappointing!


Looks great. I honestly expected the material to be heavier or higher quality (price is cheap)....its a light cotton, which is actually good for Florida! I have a little problem with necklines creaping up on my throat. This isn't bad. It looks fantastic on. Altho I usually wear a 12, I ordered a 16-18 because asian made things tend to run small. It fits perfectly.


I wore this in a wedding and got the tutu with it. This was the best descision ever and I am so glad I bought this. Fit perfectly. I did have to iron it. But everything about this purchase is amazing. I am 5'6" 110 pounds and a C bust and got a size xsmall.


Looooove my dress!!  Decently made for the price. It did come out of the package smelling a bit funny but I hung it up and aired it out and itâ€™s fine. Havenâ€™t washed it yet...  hoping it washes well bc I love it and want to wear it again!!  I got loads of compliments!


Very comfortable and super cute. Wore this with a petticoat. Sorry for the poor view but I was on crutches and was attempting t to hide them behind my sister. Wearing XS, I'm 5'2" 115 lbs


In love with the fit and style of this dress. 5' and 120 lbs with 36DD, got a small and it fit perfectly. My only complaint is that I was excited to wear it and did not wash before putting on the first time. After several hours of wearing, I developed a rash where the sleeves rubbed around my arms. I am not sure if it was because my biceps were a little larger or because there was a chemical in the clothing for shipping. Waiting to wear again and see if this problem repeats. Otherwise, wish I had picked up more designs!


I ordered paid attention to the sizing per manufacturer and bought an extravel small.  The fit was great EXCEPT for over my rib cage.ğŸ¤�.  Such a pretty dress....  I  ended up returning item, which was delt with in speedy refund.  When you " think" a size will work for you, reconsider and get a size bigger!


I'm SO glad I ordered the next size up... because it fits PERFECT.  (Most of my clothes XL... I ordered XXL).  I love this.... the style, the fit and the pattern.  And the price was AWESOME.  This is definitely a hit.


It was a perfect fit! its also a great price! I highly recommend for anyone! Its great on any occasion and very comfortable!  They are exactly what I was looking for and for the price I feel this should be on the top of everyone's list if buying a dress
