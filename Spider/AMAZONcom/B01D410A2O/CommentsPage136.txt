Cool cotton is a must for AZ women, and this fabric's pattern is so girly!


Fit perfectly! I do recommend going a size bigger, I read the reviews and it was very helpful! And the material is great!!!


I love this dress!! It is very nice and I love the way I look and feel in it.


Cute! Has skulls in the pattern. Very comfortable dress.


Fits 5'2" 110lb. Lady snugly.


This dress is so comfy and flattering. love it. has a bit of stretch. fits as expected.


Somewhat small. The quality of the material deminished after one washing.


A little stretch in the fabric but it does run a tad small in the bust. Otherwise perfect fit and wonderful fabric!


fit perfect


This dress is a must have! It's affordable, well made, beautiful and fits perfectly! I will definitely be ordering a couple more in different prints.
