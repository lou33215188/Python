I loved this dress!


Bust & waist areas seem to give extra room but armholes are way too open & reveal bra sides underneath. Like material & look of dress & debating whether to try different style.


Perf!!!! Love this dress about to buy it in Polka Dot.


Material a bit this but not scratchy.


Fit well. I ordered a sixe up. I'm usually 2x got a 3x.


Was hoping for a bit fuller skirt but it looks okay with a crinoline underneath.


Good dress for the money.


I LOVE this dress! Good quality for the price, very happy with my purchase.


Love this dress. Maybe just a little bigger on top. But it looks so nice.


Adorable dress. You must order two sizes up per their size guide. Lovely cotton material, looks great with a stiff petticoat underneath in red. Got lots of compliments.


Nicer material than I was expecting. It's a little snug in the chest but I have 34FFs so you know the struggle is real.


I normally wear a Large in dresses. Great fit. Many compliments. I love these dresses. Have it in 3 colors.


I bought this dress for my daughter and she received a lot of compliments on the dress.
