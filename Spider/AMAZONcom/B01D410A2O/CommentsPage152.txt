There was no belt on dress like shown in picture.


Loved this so much, I ordered another one in a different color.

The dress is normal but the belt was definitely a no good.


Daughter wore it for a vocal competition. Very comfortable, flirty yery professional look.


Bought this dress for my daughter and it fit her perfectly.


I got a side up and it fit great!!! Looks good!
