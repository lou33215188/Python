xl was much larger across the back, arms and high chest than expected. Returning it.


Absolutely love this style dress, very comfortable, and classic.


Very satisfied!!!!!! The dress made me feel very feminine and pretty.  Loved it. I received many compliments from husband, kids, and complete strangers.


I bought this for a bridal shower - Retro themed. It's comfortable, a little snug and I had ordered the largest size I believe. But I liked it and it worked great.


Adorable dress and great quality.


I absolutely adore this dress. Comfortable, flattering and looks much more expensive than it is.


THIS DRESS IS SOOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!!!!! I usually wear a size 8 and the large fits perfectly. So cute. Totally buying more!!!!


The waist was a bit snug and the material doesn't stretch much.  The dress is well made though and looks nice.  The belt is stiff and will be replaced with a black one.


Fit better then expected


Perfect. I get so many compliments
