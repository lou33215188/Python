Dress is well made. I ordered a 1x and was afraid it would be small but fit perfectly. I wear a US size 16 pants and a medium or large shirt. Dress comes to my knees so very modest. I love it!!!


Arrived quickly, it fit well, and the color was gorgeous.  I received dozens of compliments on my outfit when I wore it.  Will probably get a few more colors.


The dress was okay. It was small and the color was a little lighter than I thought.


Love this dress!  Fits my frame perfectly. I have proportionate curves (chest, waist and hips).


Wore this dress to a wedding and I've never been so comfortable!! It was the perfect length and fit - not too much flare.


Dress was used for a decades theme party. Dress fit nicely.


Too small and too high-waisted for a person 5'8". I had to return it even though the style and polka dots are cute.


I loved the fit! I'm 4'11 and pear-shaped and I got a medium. I could have done a small just because it runs a little big at the top and I'm a 34C. Overall, it fit the occasion perfectly!

Love it!
