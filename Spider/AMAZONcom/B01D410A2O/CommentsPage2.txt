So happy with the dress. I needed for a styled shoot and fit my model size as a glove. Arrived in 2 days wow!! and it was perfect! if I do more shoots like this I will order more dresses. I purchased a petticoat and was just like back in the 50's. LOVE IT!!!


I really really love this dress. It is a great quality of fabric and a great fit. It is puffy enough to wear without a petticoat and you are also able to wear one (which I did). I can not wait to buy more of these in this color and others. I have recommended this dress to everyone that I have talked to about it. There are absolutely no cons for this dress!


Knowing this dress has more of a "modern" sizing I ordered my daughter the large. She normally is a 6-8 in women's, which roughly translates to a small or medium. She was a bit shocked I'd ordered her a large.  But it fits beautifully. She wore it to church this morning and got tons of compliments. For people concerned about modesty, it hits below the knees, the neckline is high, the bodice is fitted but not too tight. I know those are not big concerns to most people but for someone on the fence it might help. Also the material is a stretchy cotton that loves wrinkles. I assume it will iron well I just didn't bother and most of the wrinkles were not too noticeable while wearing.


Nathan's wife review: I love this dress. My measures are 1.52 cm , waist 75 cm, weight 115. I am so happy with this dress. Great quality. My husband likes how I look with this dress. I will buy in green too. Thank you for this beautiful dress.


 I ordered this dress specifically for a retro night theme ballroom class. (But to wear again also!) it is beautiful. It fit amazingly. Only problem was the bust area is a bit large but that is to be expected with needing a bigger size and having a smaller chestğŸ˜‰ But I loved this dress so so much! It fit as expected, I am 5'9, 215lbs and ordered a XXL.. fit great! I got so many complements from complete strangers about this dress! I went to eat, dance and Walmart and probably got 20 compliments!ğŸ˜Š I have posted a video from my ballroom class to see how lovely this dress moves while dancing.. this is without a petticoat but I plan to wear one in the future. Looks great with or without one! Just in this video I have paired it with a black belt instead of the bow that comes with it, as that is in my hair :) I have been ballroom dancing just since march 24 of this year and this is a waltz :) hope this review helps anyone trying to decide ğŸ˜Š


I am overall very pleased with this dress.


The color is accurate to the photos and the fabric is a slightly stretchy material that's also a bit firm and structured as opposed to a silky fabric. The provided belt is completely detached and is a long piece of matching fabric. This allows you to adjust the belt however you would like and structure the bow as you please. One thing to note is that some of the descriptive photos show belt loops along the side of the dress however mine did not come with belt loops. The dress puckers slightly near the near the back and neck area. The cap sleeves are roomy and the bust area is also roomy enough for a fair amount of movement. In terms of sizing, I generally wear a 2X and sometimes a 3X, however I am pictured wearing a 3X and it is a tad small on me. I am 5' 9'' and the dress just touches my knees. Depending on your measurements around the waist and bust I might recommend sizing up however this dress fits perfectly around the arms and hips. I am not wearing a petticoat in this photo however it does give a nice bit of volume on its own.


I will be wearing this dress to a 1940s/1950s wedding and I think it will be perfectly comfortable and appropriate. Regardless of these issues this dress looks and feels much more expensive than it is and I am happy with my purchase.


This dress is gorgeous! Shipped timely. I had to iron it when I received it but it looked great. I wore a petticoat underneath. I wanted a more primary green but it was more pine green but the color was rich. I forgot to put on the belt but it still was cute without it


Love it. The material is nice and it fits perfect. I like it best with a petticoat underneath.


This dress exceeded my expectations!!! It is so pretty!! The belt is removable so it can be worn however you want to wear it front back or even side. The top fits so nicely!! Very happy! I am 5'1 115 pounds and the dress goes just past my knees! I ordered a small and it fits perfect!! Made very well would recommend!! It did have a bit of a weird smell and it was heavily wrinkled when I first put it on (see photos posted) but that is nothing a quick toss in the dryer can't fix.
