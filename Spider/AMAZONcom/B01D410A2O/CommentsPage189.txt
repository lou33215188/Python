Love the dress! I also purchased the petticoat to go under the dress but honestly it looks great either way. Iâ€™m 5â€™10, weigh 145lbs and have a long torso. The dress fits me perfect in an XL and falls right at my knees with the petticoat and just a little of the petticoat peaking out from under the dress.


My hubby actually commented on how nice the dress was when I received it and just tried it on for the first time. It does need to be ironed before worn but other than that itâ€™s perfect the color, length, and what I imagined for a vintage dress.


Love the way it fits. I wear a US 18, bought 3 of these dresses in a size 3xl and it's perfect. My honey wants me to buy more!


Love love love this dress. Pulled it on without unzipping . Paired with a black petticoat and black wedges all from Amazon ğŸ–¤


Great dress. I love that it's cotton with just a little bit of lycra and not polyester. It was a 86 degree weather and pretty humid and I was very comfortable. I'm 5'7, 170lb and large fit me perfectly. I got the green one and wore it to my son's Christening and got a lot of complements.


I normally wear 12/14 in a dress-I looked @ review's PLUS I've ordered from China exports and other's before- I ordered a XXL and it fit body wise perfect. This fabric is fabulous-nice sheen, bright color and has a good stretchy feel. I bought purple-but since complimented my figure so well I will be ordering few more in diff colors.


I absolutely love this dress!  Not only is the fit wonderful, but I received so many compliments while I was wearing it.  It really has that retro vintage look; so much so, I had a gentleman tell me that all I was missing was a poodle, which brought a smile to my face.  And, while wearing it to a baby shower, two individuals took a picture of it in order to order one for themselves.  I have a strong feeling I will be ordering another one...


Finding the right dress to wear for the homecoming of my sweet Marine was a challenge. I was looking for something classy, subtly patriotic, well-made and comfortable for the hours of ceremony. This beautiful white dress with navy flower pattern is more lovely than I had hoped!! It is very well made; the length is just below my knees (I'm 5'1"), it fits in a flattering way through my waist and is not tight across my chest/shoulders. Originally I was going to get a medium, but when they sold out in that size I chose the large thinking I could take it in if need be. It fits beautifully! I like the large, because there is room for when my sweetheart and I go swing dancing, so I won't get constricted or tear a seam during a dip. They go quickly, ladies, I found by experience! And bow I understand why!! I will most definitely be purchasing more of this classy style from Dressystar.


I'm, 5'9" and 250 lbs, very busty (F cup) and this dress was perfect. I was even able to pull it over and not have to unzip as I have no helper to zip from the back but then it tapered at my waste at just the right place, under my bosom to be very slimming as I also am middle heavy. Very, very pleased and impressed!


I bought the Royal Blue dress.  I love the fit, the line, the feel--I felt elegant and ladylike in this dress!  What I don't love: the wrinkles.  The dress came folded and had to be ironed before wearing.  Not a huge set-back, and the dryer might have fixed this problem.  Also the sleeves were a little tight; but I have broad shoulders for my size.  I am a small and the dress fell just below my knees, which is the length I was looking for!  Next time I might wear a contrasting belt with the dress, as the sash is removable (which brings another point: there are no belt loops, which the picture leads one to believe).


I got this dress for a last minute Halloween costume and it came in within three days and exactly as pictured. Iâ€™m 4â€™11â€�, 120 pounds and bought the small, it has stretch so I could have easy worn an xsmall as well but the small was a comfortable fit, it was a very solid tea-length in me(mid calf) which is the look I was going for. I was happy that the belt was removable even though I wore it, itâ€™s nice that I could swap it out for other belts. The dress did come in wrinkled but a quick iron would have fixed the problem, most of the wrinkles came out from hanging up for a few hours. The only complaint I had is that the dress had a very strong vinegar smell to it(possibly the due?)something that should come out in the wash but I didnâ€™t have time. Otherwise a great pinup style dress for much cheaper than other places and very quick shipping!
