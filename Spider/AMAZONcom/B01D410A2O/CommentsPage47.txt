Based on reviews I ordered one size larger than normal. It's perfect! Based upon that experience, it runs small.  Fabric is much better quality than I expected for the price. The dress is very cute.


I bought these for my nieces who will be my junior bridesmaids and I absolutely love them!


Lovely coral color but my  teenage daughter thought it resembles nurse uniform after trying it. I think it is a very sweet and pretty summer weight  dress for young ladies.


I was hesitant to order this dress as I was not sure of the fit.  It fits me like a glove!  I could not be happier.  The material is slightly stretchy, which makes it comfortable.  I ordered a puffy petticoat to wear under it for the full effect.  My kids thought I looked beautiful.  They commented on how it flattered my full figure.  I can't wait to wear it for date night with the hubby.


I love the color, I love the fabric, the length is perfect. I bought a small and I'm usually a petite 4 in dresses.


Amazing dress! I odered M and it fits great! I m 5'4" and 150lb, have wide chest, Medium fits great. It is a little strechy and very pleasant to the skin.


I bought this for my daughter. The quality is much better than expected and it looks SO good on her. I want to buy one for me!


Little to much pink, and I am a pink girl.  I looked like a pepto bismal bottle.


I love it. The fit is very flattering. I have two minor complaints, which kept me from giving it 5 stars. The fabric is not stain resistant, so, even though I only wash it with light colors, after 2 washes the white polkadots are already a greyish-white. I also wish they had American sizing, but I measured and the size was correct. I plan to order more from this company.


It's excellent quality and a great fit. I did buy a size larger than I normally would- large instead of medium . I purchased the emerald green and it was true to color - gorgeous and simple .
