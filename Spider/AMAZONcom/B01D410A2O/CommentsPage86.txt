Just what I ordered and the color was what I expected.  It does run a little small like the other reviews say so I just got the next size up and it fit perfect.


Adorable!  My daughter got so many compliments on this dress.  She's 15 years old.  5'3" and 120 pounds.  We ordered the medium and it fit perfectly.  We bought the petticoat too.


Great color, great style, fits perfectly ğŸ¤—ğŸ¤—ğŸ¤— love it!


I loved my lemon print dress, and now have my second one on the way! I wear a small, and I am a size 32C in bra sizes. The small is a little loose at the top, but it doesn't bother me at all. Overall, a really great dress for a timeless look.


I love this dress.  Bought XL I am 171 lbs 40D 5ft 6.  The under arms are cut low so I will be wearing a black cami under it.  I also have a black tulle slip that looks really cute.


After returning the medium for a large it fits perfectly.  I love this dress and style, made very well too.


This is a beautiful dress. I purchased it for my upcoming birthday next week. The dress is extremely beautiful fit as expected and also simple and elegant.


Thought the  material was going to be better quality. It's still good but not as I thought it would be.


Don't know if it fits! It came with a zipper that is caught half way! So disappointed. Skirt is not as circular as image shows. Poor quality fabric. Do not recommend.


Wore this to a Christmas party with black crinoline underneath. Got so many compliments.
