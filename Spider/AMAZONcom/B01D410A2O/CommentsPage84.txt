I have a special event coming up and wanted something different and comfortable. I've not worn it yet, but tried it on and the size large fits nicely for my 5'3" 160 frame. It comes a few inches below the knee, which is exactly what I wanted...i hate the overly promiscuous "style/look" of most of today's clothing. But don't get me started on that!


I knocked one star off because it's a white dress that doesn't have a lining  (my onion all dresses are much more comfortable/prettier with a lining) but ESPECIALLY WHITE garments,  as they usually tend to be more see through....this dress is no different!! So be prepared to need to wear a cami & some style of slip or full length slip underneath!!


For the price, it's fairly nicely put together,  didn't notice anything wonky or weird at my first quick look over.


Can't wait to wear it for my special event weekend. (I have these about 3 times a year, this up coming one is a 3 day event..some are just one day...so this was the last day's outfit I needed to get.)


Love the fit and feel of this dress.. I will definitely shop with this company again!!


Wonderful! I'm around sizes XL and XXL, but I ordered a XXL and it fits really well!


A great dress, love it!!!!!


This dress I had for a funeral. I put it on and the zipper immediately popped off. Completely ruined dress and I had to use super glue since I had nothing else to wear on such short notice. Very dissapinted


Lovely dress. Got tons of complement at church. Just go off your own measurement. I normally wear Medium but Ive gained some weight and Im now in a US size 12 dress. I bought Large and it fits just perfect!!! A little difficult to iron, but worth it


Fabric is so cheap it collect lint from just airing it , the fit is unflattering . The one star because it came on time


I loved the dress fit perfect ! ğŸ˜Š


Nice dress for the money. The material is clean and crisp. The dress is true to size. Iâ€™m 5â€™1 / 118lbs and the small was perfect. The only bad thing I can say is after a while the sleeve were irritating my arms and left a mild rash.


This dress is sooooo cute! I absolutely love it!
