It fit tighter than I expected.


It runs small so size up. I'm normally a 16 and XL was too small. Includes a cute belt/sash to tie around.


Cute dress, but the belt was missing. May end up returning.


Cute dress but Way too small ! Not even close !


love it


cute


The dress is cute and the fit is as expected.  I went up one size after reading the reviews.  (I think most of the low star ratings are due to people not reading reviews...big mistake...ALWAYS read reviews, especially on clothing).


The dress was a slightly snug, but I am losing weight so by the time I will need this dress, it fit better...but even if I needed it right now, it still fits well.  My daughter said that it was slimming on me and that she really liked it.


The one thing I will mention is that I could see my bra at the arm holes.  I think this will also be an issue with any other woman who is rather chesty (I am a 40D).  The material will fit snugly at the chest and it pulls at the underarm area bringing it forward a bit to where you can see the bra.  This won't be an issue if you wear a bra that matches the color of the dress, or possibly wearing a minimizer bra.


All in all, I am extremely pleased with the dress.  For the price, you aren't going to get material quality you would find on brands such as Vera Wang...just ain't gonna happen.  Accept it, otherwise you will never be happy.


It will work well for what I intend to use it for, and I may even find other uses for it because it looks nice.


The last two dresses not good quality very disappointed


It was perfect and I got many compliments


Did not like the quality of the dress. The dress is somewhat large. Not happy at all.
