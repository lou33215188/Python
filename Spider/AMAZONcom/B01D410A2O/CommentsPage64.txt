fits perfectly! i ordered a size xs, and am usually a size 0-2!


Size chart is all wrong. Had yo pay more than dress was worth for alterations.  Not happy at all. Should have ordered a medium.


Very cute and my daughter got tons of compliments.  The bust was big for a teen, but it was still very cute.


I wear XL but I had to get a size XXL to get a good fit but it is beautiful. I absolutely love the dress.  If you want to get it just buy it a size or two bigger to get he right fit.


Great dress I'm


5'4 170 pounds and I ordered a large look great for


My vintage photo shoot my only problem


Was that it came wrinkled


It's really baggy in the bust line. If you have a small chest, it will fit funky.


Dress was too big in the chest area and arms. I'm 145 pounds and 36C ordered a large and the dress was too big would ride up from the back zipper every time I sat down. And a medium I think would be too small. Beautiful dress, just did not fit me. I was bummed about it


Wonderful dress - not the greatest quality zipper. Very tight in the bust.


My daughter is in love with this dress.


She is,5'5 147lbs I got her a large


It did fit as expected at the top. But was a little shorter than I thought.
