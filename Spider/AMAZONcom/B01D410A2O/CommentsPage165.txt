Pretty dress, very flattering. Simple but elegant, and affordable, bought it in several colors after trying on the first one.

These dresses r very pretty


I ordered this for my daughter who is at a bit of an awkward phase and I was worried the shape just wouldn't be right, but it is well cut and the fabric has a nice stretch, so it fits close without being tight and is super flattering.  I highly recommend pairing it with a petticoat, it takes the dress from nice to fabulous!


Looks just like the picture but runs in a small size.
