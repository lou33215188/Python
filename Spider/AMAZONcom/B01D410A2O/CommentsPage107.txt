Seriously LOVED this dress.  The only down side is the color is not what is shown.  It's darker and more of an orange coral than a pink coral.


Color is as shown and fits perfectly. I'm 5' 8" and 150lb - I ordered a large.


I loved color, fabric and the length of the sleeve. Im 150 lbs.


Cute dress. Love the color! See through. Faulty zipper.


just wow!


Everything was perfect about this dress. I love it.


This was a great addition to my wardrobe. I'm always wary purchasing clothes without trying them on. I appreciated the specific measurements in the size chart which helped greatly. Overall, a lovely experience.


I love it but I can't zip it by myself due to a flaw in the zipper. But beautiful dress, brought it for my birthday. I can't return it for a new one my birthday is tomorrow


For well, color is bright. Problem is that it’s the type of material that wrinkles very easily, I ironed it perfectly, ten minutes sitting down sooo wrinkley. I won’t be wearing again.


Absolutely loved this dress! Loved the fit and flow. Such a cute dress. It fit perfectly. I am a size 16 and the XXL fit just right.
