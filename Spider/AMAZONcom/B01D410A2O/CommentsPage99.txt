I absolutely loved my dress I received. I went by the size chart given and it fit perfectly, looked beautiful and I received a ton of compliments at the wedding I wore it at as the Mother of the groom.


I usually wear a 22W, weigh 270 lbs, ordered XXXL, it a bit too tight in the waist but I'm trying to rectify that by diet and exercise.


I loved this dress! It fit as expected (it is a fitted dress) and the fabric is beautiful!


I ordered the XL as I am usually a L off the rack. This dress does not have stretch to it. I am returning it and hoping to get a bigger size. From what I could tell, I am going to love the dress, Just need a bigger size :)


Got it today and tried it on! I love it. It runs a size small I feel, but I’m very busty and broad shouldered so maybe that is why. Light material but seems trusting. Wearing it to a wedding in 5 days. Will update if necessary!


The dress is pretty, just order a size larger


Great value for price


Sturdy fabric, well made, cute exactly like the photo - it's a brighter coral in person. I'm only 5'2", so I will opt to hem it - the length is past my knee.


Got this dress to because of its bright yellow color so I can create my costume as “Snapchat” for Halloween. It was a big hit! The fit was super cute and was exactly as expected.
