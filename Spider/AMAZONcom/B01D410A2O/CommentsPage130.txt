Loved this dress! Must watch where I order from, I am always checking size guide, yet many offerings are VERY undersized!!


Dress is cut for small chested women.  You must be a small person for sleeves.  Ladies they are doing this so we pay the higher price.  I am a 42 d in a petite body .


Very pretty dress,but sized a bit small. I gave this one to my girlfriend,and went up one more size for me. Still tight,but I can wear it.


The fabric looked very cheap. There isn't a return label either. I'm very disappointed about this purchase.


I get comments on this dress all the time.  Easy to wash and wear!  Size was true to chart.


Perfect fit, perfect fabric! Love it!!


I am going to try this dress for Christmas -- we might have to return it, but I think she will like it if it fits.


This is a beautiful fitting dress.  It's comfortable and just lovely to wear.


I was the most popular and cutest Birthday girl of 50 years old EVER!


(I wore this for my big birthday)


Perfect fit! Good quality!
