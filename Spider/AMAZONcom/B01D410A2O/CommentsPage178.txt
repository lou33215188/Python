Very nice dress, sizing you need to review the chart and if in the US convert the cm to inches and should find a very good fit.  Light weight fabric (I ordered the solid navy dress.) The description states the fabric is 90% cotton and 10% elastane but I think it might be closer to 95% cotton and 5% elastane ... this is not a very "stretchy" material but there is enough that its not a wrinkled mess after wearing for a few hours - held up well.


Upon arrival the dress did need a good press but nothing the iron couldn't handle.  Flattering fit and flare dress and nice price to match.  I think you would be pleased with this dress if ordering.


Beautiful dress!
