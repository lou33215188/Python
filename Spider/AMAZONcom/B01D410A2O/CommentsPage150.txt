Total crap material color.


Very flattering on this curvy girl. Fit was as expected. I love this dress and will be ordering more in different prints!


Beautiful and well made! Fit perfectly!


Fit great on my daughter who needed it for a Grease performance. Good quality for the price.


The picture looks better than in person. Not what I expected


Was cute but the xl didn't fit like expected, ran about a size smaller then I thought.


Cute dress but too small for me.


perfect for a Minnie Mouse costume! Well made, prompt delivery!


Took my measurements and choose from the chart the size I needed. Fit perfect. Absolutely love it.
