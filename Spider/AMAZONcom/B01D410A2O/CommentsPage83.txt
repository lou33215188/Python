I bought this dress for engagement pictures, but ended up having to come up with an alternate outfit. The shoulders were massive as was the area just above the bust by the collarbones which was odd. The material was thin, and because of this the seams and overlaps are much more yellow than the rest of the dress. The skirt is absolutely not as pictured, even with the same brand petticoat, and looked like a frumpy FLDS apron. It was so bad I had to laugh a little. I will definitely be returning this; it's unwearable.


I like it fits well and was packaged nicely.


Love it so much. I got an extra large ( I normally ware a large) because I read the reviews saying they ran small. The color is wonderful and exactly what I expected.


Lovely dress - especially for this low price. Made me feel like Betty Draper from Mad Men!


I love this dress! Since it is white, it's a bit see-through, but that is easily fixed with a tank top underneath and a slip. I already bought another one of this style! Its very flattering and I would highly recommend this dress for anyone who wants to look like a real lady!


Super cute dress


The material is thin and very prone to wrinkles.


I loved the dress but to small and couldn't get the size that I needed.


nice


I wear a size 14 and brought the XL, this doesnâ€™t fit in the bust. I am very disappointed.
