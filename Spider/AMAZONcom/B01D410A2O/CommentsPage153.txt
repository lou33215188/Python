It looks good on me


order this for my daughter who is 5"6 weight 155 pounds fit her fine


I wear 4 or 6 and it was too tight couldn't if it up


Fits great. Love the blue plaid.


I ordered this dress.,for a wedding.It arrived on time and it's a prefect fit.


Very pretty dress!


Sizes run small. Had to go up a size to be able to wear it.


The Fit is much better than I anticipated.  It's like it was made for me.


Love it


LOVE this dress. It does wrinkle easily but fits great and is adoreable!
