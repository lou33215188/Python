I have never had so many compliments on a dress!  This dress fits amazing and looks fantastic!  I love it and want another one in  another color!


fits my friend great.  she loves yellow and its a nice shade of yellow.  shes happy with the dress


It's a thin material, but good for the price. It's very well made and it fit perfectly. I love it! I'll be ordering more!!


The fabric was not amazing and the dress just hung wrong...returned same day received


I love it, but I wish there was net under to make it flare out more like a princess gown just like it looks here.


I got blue. The color doesn't really flatter me. But I still love it! Fabric is nice to touch and light in weight. It feels so comfortable.


Like it but didn't love it.


I love this dress!! I was worried about how it would fit, but no worries it fit perfect. I wear 18-20 and purchased the 3x. I was very pleased with the fit, fabric, and flare! I'm ordering this same dress in various colors!! Very Retro... just my style!!


Love this dress. Great fit for a top heavy woman 38 G/H.


Will be ordering another one or maybe 2 more â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�
