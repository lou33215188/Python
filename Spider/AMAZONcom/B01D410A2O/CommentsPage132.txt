As much as i wanted to like this dress, the zipper broke the first time i put it on.  I can't even return it now


Like it, but it's a little tight.


Fit well on my 11 year old daughter whos 5ft 4 in wears a junior size 9.


Very nice dress but to big for my daughter


Fits perfectly.Quality material.


Just bought it for my daughter, she is 14-16 junior size but i followed the size chart and is a XXL and fits PERFECTO!!!


Love this dress, great material really pretty


I loved this dress. It is classy and vibrant. I had to return this product due to a faulty zipper.


Need a petticoat to achieve what it looks like in the picture otherwise it looks boring in person.


great dress for the price. fit as expected.
