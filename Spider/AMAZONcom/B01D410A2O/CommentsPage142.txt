I wear sz 10 or 12 depending on the make. Bought a large/14, fit perfect


Disappointed in the material. Will be returning


The belt never came with the dress i was so disappointed. I would still like to have the belt though


Fit just fine but unfortunately a zipper broke before I got zipped up all the way the first time


Fits perfectly.  Quality is good for the price.


Material feels and looks cheap


This was ordered for my mother in law.  She loves these dresses for Church!!  She has ordered about 6 of them and most likely will get more colors.


Ordered an XS and it does not fit. Beautiful print with vibrant colors.


I love how fast it got here and it fit fine but it was darker than the picture looks.


Horrible material. Don't waste you money on this dress. Strings coming out of bottom.
