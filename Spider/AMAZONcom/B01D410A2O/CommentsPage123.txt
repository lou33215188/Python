It fits pretty perfectly and true to size. The only thing that i dont like is there are no loops for the ribbon.


Got great I normally wear a 2x but ordered a 3x based on previous reviews and it fits perfect. The sash is a bit smaller than expected but still very nice.


Liked the way the dress looked online, but in person its not what I had expected. I will keep it because it is the only dress that meets the bridesmaid dress guidelines I was given. Otherwise I would return it.


Great dress


Just a gorgeous dress all around!


I loved this dress! I ordered an 8-10 and it fit like a glove. No problems here!


Fit well - perfect size 12.  Received many compliments.  The crinoline underneath enhanced the look.  Slightly stretchy fabric allowed for comfort while dancing.  Would definitely recommend.


she loves it


This is really cute for a great price!! Wore it today for Easter Sunday mass. Iâ€™m 5 2 and weigh 132. Medium fit me perfect!


Super cute! I love it!
