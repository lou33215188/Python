Cute and inexpensive. My daughter really liked it.


Beautiful dress.  Modest.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Good fit,  good length.  Perfectly made.  I will definitely get more.  If you are like me who like the 1950s fashion you will love this dress.  I highly recommend it.


Great looking dress, nice fabric, well made.  For a dance performance I would have gone up a size.


Nice style, but material is a bit thinner then I expected. It wrinkles easily.

This dress is adorable!  Loads of compliments for this summer fun dress.  Perfect for those of us with an hourglass figure!


Really tight in some spots and really baggy in others.
