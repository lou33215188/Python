Expected it to be somewhat big. But was a success for the dance. One happy12 year old.

Beautiful dress. Gorgeous color. But a little bit to long!


nice dress, fit well


I bought this for my daughters Halloween costume and I was surprised by the quality.


The color is beautiful,but the sizes run small


I absolutely love this dress, fits perfectly


Pretty dress. Well made. Just a little too small across the bust, so I will need to return it. Might have better luck with a different style.


Sizes run small, I normally wear size 12 women's.  I ordered a XL and it was tight, so I ordered an XXL and it fit fine.


Love this dress! It needs to be steamed when it arrives, but the fit is great!
