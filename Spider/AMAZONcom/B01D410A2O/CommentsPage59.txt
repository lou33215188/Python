I do love the fit and the color is beautiful


Super cute! Lots of compliments when worn! Double check your measurements as asian sizes tend to run small in bust


Adorable dress! A little small in the bust, but otherwise perfect. The material is a nice cotton with a slight stretch, but looks and feels lovely and fresh, not poly and cheap.


Awesome dress! Awesome price and you can dress it up however you like!


The product arrived on time.  It fabric is beautiful and the dress fit perfectly. I ordered a small, for my 5ft 9in daughter who weighs 128 pounds. The dress sits just above the knees. It worked perfectly for her event.


Overall nice dress but you MUST IRON.


5’9 150lbs, I ordered a size M......if I had more time before the event I would have exchanged for a L. The dress fit great everywhere but in the shoulders it was a little more snug than my liking. Received many complements on this dress..... don’t skip the petticoat!


Very pretty and has a defective zipper


I was hoping to order the exter small for my daughter as she wears a 0-2, but they were sold out. So I ordered the small thinking I could take it in for her, but it was really tight even though it’s not her size. No time to send it back as she needs it for a play she’s in so she will just wear it uncomfortably for 2 performances and be done.


Good quality fabric. Great fit. However, the zipper would not zip all the way up due to poor stitching. Too bad. I really like the dress. I ordered it in turmeric. It's a soft muted shade of gold which looks great. For reference I'm 5'2'' 130 lbs,  30C cup. I wear size 4 in tops and 4-6 in pants. Ordered size small the fit was slightly small in the waist.


I bought this dress for my sister and for my mom for an event, the packaging was good and the dress was “beautiful” according to my mom. My sister had high praise for the dress as well
