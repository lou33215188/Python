Cute but Jesus Christ it stinks. It's so bad I can taste the smell. Awful.

I am 220lbs, 5'8" and wear a size 16 from Ann Taylor and JcPenny usually buy XL tops.


 From the plus size stores I usually buy XXL.


I got this dress in a XXL in the Army Green and I felt comfortable. Thank you


Love the dress! Perfect fit! Great quality !


The theatre I work at just had a 50s themed Gala and I needed something affordable and cute to wear. I ordered this dress in Tumeric and Leaves Flower. I am a size 14 and ordered XXL. It fits as I would expect an online XXL to fit but I felt comfortable all night long. I got tons of compliments in the cut and print and the overall look. I was aiming for a 50s Havana look and this dress nailed it. As a side note, the print dress was more forgiving than the solid color. Would buy from this brand again.
