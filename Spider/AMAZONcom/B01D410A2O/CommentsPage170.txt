So cute.


Feels great, looks great!


Beautiful dress, fits perfectly. Really modest and looks super cute. XSmall 110 pounds 5'5


Love the dress.


The dress is not as shiny as shown. It is definitely better for a shorter person. My daughter is 5'7" and the medium was too big for her slender frame. The waist sits higher than her natural waist and the bust was billowing out. A small might have fit her frame but the waist would have been too high and it would be above the knee.


Exactly as described.  My daughter loved it.  Thank you,


Love the dress but the skirt is not long enough. Will be returning it.

Product was better than I anticipated. Thanks!


My wife loves it. and if I my say so my  self she looks Mighty  fine in it to!!
