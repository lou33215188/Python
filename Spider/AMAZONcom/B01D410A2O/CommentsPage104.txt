I read reviews and ordered a size bigger but I should have stayed with my normal size. I'm a little bigger and when I tried it on it made me feel even bigger. So for that reason I sent it back.


Beautiful dress...


It was perfect for Easter Sunday - I felt lovely.  Thank you.


I love this dress! Get yourself a pettecoat it makes all the difference!


I got this dress in green for my sister, and she absolutely loves it! My sister 5'6 and weighs about 108 and I got her a small,a nd it fit perfectly. I highly recommend this dress!


it's a nice dress i like the colour but the product is so bad


I'm 5' 4" 150lbs and ordered a Medium in the cherry pattern. It fit perfectly and was everything I wanted it to be. Flowed nicely and still had very good structure and didn't wrinkle easily/at all. Definitely want to buy more of the same dress.


Super cute and light weight. Quality material. I'll probably buy at least 2 more in different colors


Super cute dress, my daughter looked beautiful for her decade dance. Love the polka dots and the fit.


I ordered this dress to wear to a wedding , although the color was beautiful and the fabric was not bad , the zipper was horrible!! Poorly made zipper , my dress broke at a wedding I was at & I had to be sewed back up. :(
