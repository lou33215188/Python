This is the cutest dress and the color (I got it in yellow) is so vibrant and summer-like! It's a completely cotton dress though it looks like it has spandex in it in the picture. I don't use the belt that came with it - instead, I put a wider obi belt on it to further accentuate the waistline. I came online to buy a second one but decided to leave a review since I'm on the site. LOVE IT!


This dress does NOT have the full circle skirt it claims to have, at all. The skirt is far from as full as it appears in the picture.


And the color is not purple at all, either. It is straight-up red.


This is not the dress I ordered.


Wife loved it,


I now own 6 of these dresses. Love them.

Dress was nicer than I thought it would be. The size came as expected.
