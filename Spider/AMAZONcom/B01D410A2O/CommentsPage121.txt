My daughter looks radiant in this dress. Simply gorgeous! My fiancee selected this style. It is perfect for use as bridesmaid dress for our wedding.


Great dress, love the color, love that it fits perfectly and especially the price


This dress is beautiful and the quality is excellent! Such a great deal, I got so many compliments on it.


Weird fit. Cheap material. The color is not wine, but a kind of red purple.


Dress came as depicted in the picture. Nice material. Colors are really pretty. Can't wait to see her in everything we bought for her tomorrow at her middle school promotion.


Very cute dress. A little too big on but one size down would be too small.


Definitely go up a size when you order since the dress does run small, but the fabric has some stretch so itâ€™s got great movement. Really great quality!


Fits well a bit big on the top, but overall good


I LOVE The look and feel of this dress!! I added a petticoat. It was a hit at my New Year Eve party!!


Well made but  the sizing is inaccurate even using the chart.  Having to have it altered.
