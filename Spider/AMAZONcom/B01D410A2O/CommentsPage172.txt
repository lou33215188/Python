Love this dress my cousin Lindsay did a review in it with a picture I had to have one


Longer than expected


It's a nice dress but it runs small. Should have ordered one size up.


I liked it.


Great dress


This dress is awesome. I wear a size 18 so I order a 2X and it fit perfectly!


The zipper was broken. Other then that it fit great


Is small compared to the posted size of the clothes


Fits true to size and looks wonderful. I bought 2 others.


Love this dress
