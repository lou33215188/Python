I absolutely love this dress. Fits perfectly. Very comfortable and a lot of fun to wear.


I love the dress!  I purchased another Dressystar item unfortunately which is of similar style. I will keep both of them! I could habe used one size down for the capped sleeve dress, but I am going to keep it! The look is nice, the fabric feels great, and the color is spot on!


Cute but fabric isn't quality fabric.  Too flimsy.  Also pattern far from aligns so that is a bit bothersome.


Love it


Somewhat small in arms area and zipper  sticks


Very nice material with just a little strength. Dress is true to size. I am 163 1bs bust 38.5 inch inches waist 37 inchesand hip 43 inches and normally wear a large or size 12-14 US... And I find that I was satisfied with the fit. I ordered Navy blue and the colour was as in the modeled photo. Wear this with a petticoat to get nice beautiful volume


Good for a special event. But the only thing is that get too wrinkle in the bottom. The top part is great. Looks pretty.


Wifey is 5,2 ft


140 pounds.


And big boobs! (We ordered a large)


It was ok i guess. The material was the worst. But you pay for what you get


Amazing quality. I have continually been surprised at the great quality of the dresses I have ordered. It fits great, do not go off of the American sizes make sure you actually measure yourself. If you are wanting it to be a little poofier I recommend buying a petticoat to go under. I have one and it made this dress absolutely perfect.


Came with a broken zipper. Looks as cheap as you'd expect for a cheap Amazon dress.
