These dresses ran very small.  The style is nice.  I did not like the material it was a hard. I would order a size up if the material was better.  I wish it was made from a better material.


All of the dresses I've bought in this style are lovely. They all fit as expected and especially with the petticoat, it makes the dresses even more beautiful.


super cute, but does run a tad bit small.  also, the sleeves don't go under the arm, it's a true "cap" sleeve, so if you wear anything under it, it will definitely show when you move your arm.


I wish this dress came in one size bigger.  I normally wear a 2x but ordered a 3x after looking at the measurements.  I couldn't quite breath in it so sent it back, but it was so flattering and seemed to be well made.


I loved this dress!! I received several compliments!! I ordered a 2xl because the reviews were so mixed. It was too large but nothing that I couldn't adjust! Beautiful and elegant!


Beautiful dress and the fit is amazing. The material is very bright and crisp.


I am disappointed that the bow isn’t attached and pre tied because it isn’t going to look as good in the picture which is what I was expecting.


I wasn't too impressed with this dress after I received it . The color was wonderful but I didn't like the sash for the dress thought it was attached to the dress and the upper part of the dress fitted me a bit full.


Was perfect for the evening.


Comfortable
