I love this dress. I received so many complements.


Love the print!  Only slightly large for me, I was able to wear it & be comfortable. Paired with a black crinoline, It made a big hit at a dance !


i like the way it is made


Color is different than what I expected


Will be returning for a bigger size.


The dress fit spot on. The fabric felt nice.the lenghth was just at the knee.


Great dress! Looks elegant! Color is awsome! My friends asking me where I bought this beautiful dress!


I order a larger dress will keep this one also.


Bought this for my Christmas work party and it looks great! I wear it to work as well. Still looks great after many washes. Suggest hanging up to dry and ironing inside out.


Let me start by saying that this dress was well made and the color is true to what you see on the listing.  My only issue was that the dress was way too big for me.  I ordered an extra large thinking it would be too small if I went with the large.  I should have ordered the large.  With the right size selected, I feel that this dress would have been lovely.  Unfortunately, I will have to return it to the seller.
