It's a great pattern and fits perfectly. I wish the skirt was a bit fuller because my petticoat shows a bit underneath. Still great.


Cute little dress I purchased the red with black polka dots it fits perfect but maybe I should have gotten a different color the one I brought not flattering


very nice good fit nice length easy to wash and wear


I got so many compliments on this dress. Just walking into stores people were saying just how pretty this was. I loved the color. I love everything about this dress.


i'm a plus size woman size ( 18/20 ) and its sometimes hard for me to find a dress on amazon that fits and does not make me feel like a sausage in casing, this dress did not hug my tummy or cut off my arms the color is bright


this dress was a good fit and the only reason im giving in 4 out of 5 is that the dress fit the belt did not =[


Bought it 2 times to fit my girlfriend. She liked it.


Perfect fit. I wear large and large was it. Picture tells the story.


The dress is beautiful. I'm giving it a 3 star because of the material. One wash and I will not be able to wear it again. The zipper is cheap as well. I won't be ordering from this company again.


beautiful color green..should have got a large..but it's a true medium.  but does need ironing


It is a beautiful dress and fit perfectly. The fabric is great quality and it looks stunning.


I needed to iron/steam it after its arrival due to the shipping packaging, but overall, it was wonderful and I love it!
