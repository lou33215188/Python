Snug fit way different sizing than expected.  Had to order about 3 sizes to big so it would fit the person.


Such a cute dress.  Good price for the quality.  I receive comolime ts all of the time when I wear this dress.  I will buy it in more colors.


This is not a prom dress.  It's a very thin cotton dress.  I don't understand why it has such great reviews.


This is really cute!  I paired it with a black belt and it really completes the outfit.  It does come with a fabric belt, but I'm not good with those.  This was a good purchase.


Very simple dress that is absolutely flattering to a curvy figure (I'm a size 14).  I LOVE this Dress!!


I usually never have a problem with stuff I buy on Amazon. But the zipper wasn't working and it did not come with a bow like the picture showed. I looked at other people's pictures that purchased this dress, and saw that they had a bow.


I thought it would be more satin and formal, but the cut was exactly what I wanted. I was even more pleased to find that it was not satin-y. It's perfect,  even better than I expected. I love it!


A beautiful dress! Absolutely perfect! Love this color!


It's a tad tighter than I thought it would be but still it's a great dress and totally works!! It's SUPER cute!!!! I love it!!


I purchased this dress as a gift for my sister's birthday and she absolutely loves it. The fit is perfect (she wears a size 14/16 in girls clothes and I ordered the XS) and the color is so vibrant and beautiful. The first thing she did when she put it on was spin, it has a great full skirt, and is absolutely darling on her.
