I'm an 8-10 and 34DD bought the large and it fit great, length is perfect with a petticoat under it I'm 5'7' only complaint is around the neck area it had a big gap...


I am 5'8 185lbs. I bought the XXL and it fits great with a bit of looseness, exactly how I wanted it. It was gorgeous with a petty coat. I had a lot of compliments.


I am not satisfied with the dress XXL. I received the dress without the belt, while the package was well closed. It is not interesting.


The photo of this dress leads one to think it has a full (circular) skirt, but it is in fact more straight in the front.


Love the color and fit. I'm 5' and dress comes below my knees which is perfectly fine with me. The material is smooth and not clingy. I love in middle GA and the weather here is hot & humid which makes this dress perfect to wear to church and social functions. My husband loves the conservative Hepburn look.There is only one con about the dress and that is at the waist, the zip gets a little sticky to pull down, no muscling needed just need to pull the dress down and taunt. Wish you had this in a light blue or aqua color. I would definitely buy more if there were more colors offered!


Fits great, beautiful color (green)


Dress is OK. Fabric is medium weight cotton with no stretch. There aren't any darts that I recall. Fit suffers due to these two factors.  I followed suggestions made by others in terms of sizing, but the dress was too big. The shape was rather sack-like. It wasn't worth ordering a smaller size.  Use of a wide sash, perhaps in a coordinating color, would improve the dresses' silhouette.


Look this dress. The length is perfect.


My mom bought this dress for me - it’s beautifully made and very nice quality. I’m a plus size, but even though she ordered a size up for me, it was still so small that I couldn’t zip it up.


Nice, cool and comfortable!!!
