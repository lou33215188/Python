Adorable dress. I got a lot of compliments on it. The green is beautiful. The only problem is it arrives very wrinkled....Kind of hard to iron.


It's a lovely dress. It got here very quick.


This dress fits so well right out of the box. As a average 14-16 US I was concerned about how the fit around the bust would be. There's plenty of room in the chest for range of motion without being too tight. I purchased the gray petticoat as well for dramatic effect and found myself twirling all night for no particular reason. The coral (truly beautiful) color matched perfectly with the slip and the fabric is quality. Initially a cheap halloween costume will now be my go to outfit for many upcoming weddings.


Too small. Not a 3x.


too short


I love the cut and fit of this dress.  I got alot of compliments when I wore it.  I have at least 4 of their dresses and each one fits great


great material. perfect fit.


Perfect


This dress was AMAZING!!! It fits exactly how the chart says. The material is great. I would buy several more dresses from this line.


I will say, I am 5'3 and had to have it pulled up a little.. maybe it's made for someone a little taller.


5'3 was 195 then got a XXL fit AMAZING!!


Although this is a cute style of dress, it is more of a costume dress than a nice dress. The fabric is like a simple broadcloth. The belt/tie is a separate sash that is not very wide. We wanted something modest with sleeves that would at least go to the knee, but for my 5' 8" daughter it wasn't long enough. We bought this in size 10 as a possible dress for her homecoming dance, but it just wasn't nice enough. With some nice accessories we could have made it work, but we decided to return it and go with something a little nicer instead. However, if we were wanting cute costume dresses this would have worked great.
