I ordered this dress to wear as a Derby day outfit.  I love it!  I ordered a small and it fit perfect.


Classy and stylish!! I felt like I walked out of a 1950's movie. To achieve the poofy dress look, you will need a petticoat. You can purchase one on amazon!!


I love theses dresses!!! I have four different colors


Nice dress....zipper not working properly.


Bought this dress for my mom, it fits as expected and itâ€™s cute.


Dress was poor quality and had horrible smell from the plastic bag toxic pvc !!


This dress fit great (5'2", 125 lbs), and I got lots of compliments. It did arrive very wrinkly, but it all ironed our fine.


buy a smaller size,,, I bought multiple sizes for a dance, i ended up buying all XS ,, but great quality, and material,,, Highly recommend it.


I can't wait to wear it. It fits me perfectly. I normally wear a 12-14 based on comments I purchased an XL. Beautiful dress,very flattering and classy. Highly recommended.


I love this dress! I bought it for my brother's wedding and I wore it one time to see how it moves and whatnot. Super comfortable, super cute! I received many compliments on it. I will definitely buy more in other colors.
