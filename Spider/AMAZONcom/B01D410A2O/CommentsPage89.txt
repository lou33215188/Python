Cute, exactly as pictured, great value for the price.


It is a bit small, but still fits nice. Husband approved.


Many compliments on dress and inquiries on where I found. Was looking for something fun and different for a wedding and this fit the bill completely!!


i wore this with a petticoat the flare was amazing.


A little tight, but not unbearably so and it loosens up as you wear it. I love it!


The dress was just what I needed. It fit nicely and the color was perfect. I need the ROYAL blue.


This is another dress.  Very cute but not made to US sizes.


I purchased a large I'm 5'2 and 165 pounds, we were needing a red dress for confirmation. I absolutely loved the fit. It is stretchy so don't worry about stiffness. The length is perfect if you want to stay conservative.


this dress is cute...


The dress is beautiful.  However, it runs a big snug on the chest area.  I am usually a 2xl and had to get this dress a size bigger.
