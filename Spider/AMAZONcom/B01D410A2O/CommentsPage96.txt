Stunning dress!


The dress is a perfect fit. The dress needs to be ironed before wearing. Fabric quality is OK.  For the given price it's definitely worth it. I love the belt.  I got a XL size and it perfectly fits me.


This dress is perfect. Everything I wanted and more. It is very flattering and fits wonderfully. I just might need to buy every design. Thank you so much.


Very flattering.


Cute for work


cute style but zipper i'snt very good broke first time trying it on went by size chart:(


Perfect Audrey Hepburn costume. Fit my very skinny (size zero) daughter perfectly, and she looked just like her character. Shipping was good too! We ordered the suggested crinoline too. The dress kind of needed it. It was perfect.


wife loves it


Cute dress, but a little too big in the bust and small in the arms for my teenage daughter.


Absolutely love this dress it’s true to size you can even go down one because the material is stretchy and I look absolutely amazing in it ❤️
