Love this dress, very flattering for my figure and is true to size in fit. I would definitely buy from this company again.


It was too small through the chest.


Just what I needed for a 40s party!


Love the dress but seems to run a little small


Lightweight fabric, flattering, classic.


Love this dress! But, my hubby calls it my Minnie Mouse dress.


somewhat small.


it didn't come with a bow like in the picture!!!


i got it for a bridesmaid dress now i have to find a bow to put on it


This is a lovely dress. I am 53 and 118 pounds and the medium was very comfortable. It is modest but classy. I would get it again in another color. The "army green" is more of a emerald green.


Bought this for my 12 yr old daughter.  She loved it.  The color (purple) was perfect.  Fit her perfectly as well.


So inexpensive and fit perfectly!
