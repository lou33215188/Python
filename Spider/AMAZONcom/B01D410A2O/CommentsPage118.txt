Love the dress....make sure you order up!  I am a 16/18 U.S and the XXL fits like a dream.


This dress is so freaking cute. Perfect fit with a tiny bit of stretch. My daughter will be wearing it to Sweethearts. For a more formal look, it needs a fluffy slip.


This dress is made very nicely and I have gotten numerous comments on it.


I ordered this and it fits great. It has odd sizing. I'm a 16 and I got the 3X. I'm more of a 14 to 16 so clearly very odd sizing. It is a very nice material, not see through, colors are as pictured. I'm 5'11 and it goes maybe 1 inch below my knee. It has a little flare in the skirt. The waist line is a couple inches below the bust. It will make anyone look slim and it is great. But if you are an 18 or above, it won't fit. It really depends on where you carry your weight. I will say that it looks better if you have some curves. I would recommend.


Fitted perfectly. I love this dress.


Received the wrong dress.


Bought this for my very tall 9 year old cousin. Material is somewhat cheap, but pattern is great!


I haven't worn it yet but I put my slip under it and it is gorgeous for a beach wedding. Perfect!


Love them! Can't wait to wear them this summer!


Darling dress.
