Love it! It does fit a little big on top, but other reviews indicated that so I was prepared.


Love this dress. Love the fitting. Fabric is also nice but not as expected thatâ€™s why 4 stras


I wore this dress today with a petticoat. I received so many compliments and even had people as where I bought it. Love this cut. So comfortable and so flattering.


The dress is adorable and I love it.


Very cute!


This product arrived on time; however the material is super cheap. It advertises as 3X, but it is more of a 3X girls size not women. It was about 6 sizes too small. I would avoid this product.


So many compliments.... I order an xxl and it fit perfectly. My measurements around the bust is 42 and 37 waist.


Great fit, true to size, received the dress exactly the way it was pictured on here. Love the lemon print perfect for a summer dress, good fabric.


Love it!!


The dress was cute,  but cut too small.
