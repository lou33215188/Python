the best dress so far


I wasn't satisfied with the quality or the look of the dress.


Love the dress! My only complaint is the bow not being long enough to tie in an actual bow like the picture. Also there is no loop for the bow so it fell if not tied tight enough. Other than that it fits very well and the material is quality material; not cheap looking. I will definitely buy again!


Very cute dress for a great price. We bought the XS and it fit my very skinny teen daughter nicely.


The product was beautiful and well made but I returned it because it was too similar in color to another dress I have. I reordered in a different color and was highlighted satisfied with the fast shipping and amazing product


I ordered up 2 sizes and I probably could have just went up one size... seems to be very good quality especially for the price.


The zipper is horrible. The dress looks nice but the zipper is super cheap.  I will keep the dress and put a new zipper but won't be able to wear it to church on Sunday for Easter


Beautiful


Love the fit, got lots of compliments


Very cute dress. Packaged very nicely. It was bought for my teen daughter. She has a short torso so I had to get it altered. We had to replace the zipper because it kept getting stuck and that's why I gave the product 4 stars.
