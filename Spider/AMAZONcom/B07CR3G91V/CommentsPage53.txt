Love this dress! I have ordered M in black ( I am 5'7, 143 lbs). If I ordered smaller size I don't think it would fit in my hip area. Very comfortable and hits my knees.


I love this dress!! The first one I ordered was too small, but I returned it and got the XL and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'2" and 155lbs and very busty (38DDD). It's sexy without showing a lot of skin. Great for the office or can be dressed up for special occasions.


Really nice.. I'm 5.5 170 & 12


It fit me however the style is very awkward and unflattering.


This is a really nice dress for the price. Great fit and quality


This dress is  simply fabulous! I bought it for a wedding and it delivered.


It is elegant fits like a dream and does not look cheap!


Quite pleased with it and pleasantly surprised that it looks so good for the price I paid!


I am 110lbs, 5 foot 3, and this dress fit like a glove. It goes to my knees and is form-fitting. It is good, quality material. I highly recommend.


I love this dress. Very nice material. Fit perfectly. It looks a lote more expensive than its price. I'm wearing it for my work interview !! I love this.


Just buy it! I love this dress. Great quality (as always for this brand). Thick material, not see thru. Very flattering and sexy. Forgiving in the tummy. I’m 5’4”, 145lbs. Typically a size 8-10, bought the medium and it fits beautifully.


I bought this dress to wear for an event on Sunday with the two day free shipping however it arrived with deodorant stains all over it.
