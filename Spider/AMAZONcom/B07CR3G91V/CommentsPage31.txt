Colour is great, quality is good, fits like a glove and it makes me look so sexy! It is a as advertised. Im 5"2' and 148 lbs and I got a size M.


My bust is 36B, waist is 27" and my hips are 44".


Miusol did it again. My dress fit as expected and the material is nice and lays just right. I am 38 in the waist, wear 36DD and am 5' 8". I got an XL dress. With a waist trainer...perfect.


great dress, very flattering, well made and fits perfectly - I bought a size up I'm generally a 12/14 and purchased an XL I love it and will be buying more from Miusol!


The side stretch bunched from the top all the way through, looked as if I had a kangaroo pouch.


Awesome dress; awesome fit. Ordered up a size just to be sure and it still fit very well!


Sizing runs way small, most likely 2 sizes smaller than advertised. Could not even get this dress on. Returned!


Love it ! fits very nicely,color is perfect fabric feels good Cant wait to wear it


Beautiful red thick dress and fits as expected. I ordered a size medium.You can never go wrong with Miusol. I love the dress. I recommend you buy it.


Cute dress, looks like the picture and shipped quickly! Material is nice and thick, but don't expect it to hold you in.


Dress was slightly large in the waist, but is easy enough to take in. All in all, this is a great dress for under $30.


This is a lovely dress. I'm going to wear it to work. I'm excited about that. I am 185 lbs, 5'8" tall and my waist measures 37" (for now. lol); I bought a large and it fits perfectly. I hope this helps someone.
