Love it!! Perfect fit....will buy in another color


Very flattering


It was too small because I wear an extra small typically and it fit me.


This dress is amazing. Fits great, the fabric is nice, a little stretchy and looks very high fashion


Great dress. I'm very happy.


Looks great but was too big hope I can return for smaller size


Loved this dress! Fits nice and looks lovely


It fits perfect... I was getting it to wear for a wedding, the bride wants all the ladies attending to wear blue so this dress is just perfect as far as the fit & color, thanks!!!


Beautiful dress but bigger than expected. I'm 5' 01", 110lbs and the size small was too big.


Love love this dress! So many compliments fits very well and looks classy!
