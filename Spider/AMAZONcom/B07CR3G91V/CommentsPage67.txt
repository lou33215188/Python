Wow I was surprised at the quality despite the price. I am in love!


Fantastic Buy. Stretchy and comfortable


I'm 5'10" and it hit just at the knees standing but rides up while seated.  Otherwise the fabric is great, thick!.


No lining, but not too se through.


Very well made, not heavy, looks beautiful! I  am very happy with this purchase. Will wear on my job interview...


The red dress isn't as dark as pictured. It's more of a bright red, but still gorgeous! I kept it.


Excellent. Looks great on me.


Simple but makes a statement. Great for career/datenight/church just fits into any wardrobe


The sleeves and ruffle are just serged at the ends, not finished as a business dress should be...fit is great, fabric quality is great but i feel like i just got lazy at the end of a sewing project and decided to wear it half-way constructed


All perfect and shipping very fast.
