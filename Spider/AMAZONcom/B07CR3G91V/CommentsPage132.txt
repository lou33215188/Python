Not  what  it appeared to be


I knew from the reviews that it would be small so I ordered an XL when I am usually a medium but it is lovely.


Cute dress. I'm 5'5 125lbs and got a small. Fits good. Great for work. Material seems like it'll hold up well.


excelent!!


I like the dress but I got one size up & still fit snug- with a body former worked fine with a blazer on top.


It was a perfect fit


Absolutely loved this dress!


I ordered it a size larger than my normal size and the dress was still two sizes too small.


This dress fitted me perfectly. I love it.


Love this dress!!!
