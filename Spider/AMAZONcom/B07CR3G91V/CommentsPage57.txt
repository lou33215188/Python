I 5.4 feet, I have 135 pounds, I ordered the small size; it fit perfect, i love it


Looks good but runs small.


Pretty dress, runs small my 2x is not a 2x....i had to give it away..


love it and  very sexy


The dress itself was gorgeous! I normally wear a size L but I ordered an XL to be on the safe side because of the material and the XL was too small.  It was a little disappointing.  It was returned for that reason.


I love this dress, the material is thick, stretchy, but form fitting. Love it!


Looked exciting as advertised. Fits perfectly. I wear a size 10 and bought an XL . Everyone liked it my worked event. Color was good. No defects at all . Great buy!


I really loved this dress and received a lot of positive compliments.


Love it. Very beautiful dress. Bought a large.
