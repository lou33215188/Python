Beautiful dress! I would keep it if it didn't rise up. I prefer slightly below knee length like on the model but when I walk it's rising up and become too short for my liking.


I purchased a medium. 5feet and 3 inches with a weight of 140lbs. Very nice material. My husband gave me multiple comments on it. Very form fitting, I should thank everyone who give reviews because you really are the eyes of the purchase.


It fits fine. I had high expectation on the dress but the sleeves didn't go well.


This dress I really liked! Very professional looking, great for work. Anything from miusol is worth buying for the price.


Very flattering dress made of stretchy material.  The ruffles add a great touch to the dress, and the ruching is placed perfectly on the belly to not be so tight.  I am 5'9" and the dress comes down to the knee.  The size M fit perfectly for my 145lb frame, making it a perfect cocktail dress for any special occasion.  Highly recommend this dress as it is really cute and you CANNOT beat the quality for the price.


Excellent buy dress fits perfect. Good quality fabric. I got a 2X and I normally wear 14-16


Beautiful, excellent quality but It ran large for me. I ordered a large for my 33" waist and 39" hips.  Fits big at the chest and arms but great at the hips


I absolutely love this dress. I bought it to wear to my graduation and I was not disappointed at all when it came. I will provide pics after my graduation.


Great dress. Just super long on my (5’ 1”). Morning that I can’t get hemmed though!


Great dress. Love the colour. Love the material it's nice and thick, very good quality. I am a tall girl and the dress caught me at the knees which is great.
