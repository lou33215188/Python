Super cute dress. Fits perfectly. Got lots of compliments.


The material feels nice and looks nice but it's not true to size. I found the medium to be too big in the stomach area making it look like your bigger than what you are. This would be a nice maternity nice though because of belly area being a little bigger.


I purchased this for my daughter and it is perfect.


I love how this dress feels and I just order another for a wedding.Will buy from this seller again another black dress


Love the style of this dress. I purchased a size large and fits comfortably. Miusol delivers again!

I love it and the colour is great


It is a really pretty dress. Great fabric, perfect length, and stylish. Color was vibrant and lovely. But I ordered a Medium, usually wear a Small-Medium and this dress was far too small. I am giving it 4 stars because it really is pretty and perfect in every other way.


Beautiful dress, feels and looks of good quality, fits as expected. The navy blue is a nice, deep, but not too dark color.
