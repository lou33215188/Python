zipper broke while wearing at work and had to cover up with a sweater. Embarrassing


Heavier material so not good for hot weather. Fits great and looks fantastic on.


Love it! great dress, great fabric.


love this brand.  everyone gives me compliments.  perfect for the office or a dinner


fits small


Think fitted dresses like Claire Underwood (House of Cards). I love this. My favorite part is the neckline detail. I wish it came in more colors.


Even though I ended up returning it, it wasntl't because of quality or fit other than i am very short waisted so it sat weird on the waist and hip area. Not anything to do with size chart or company, just my odd body type. I would give it a 5 otherwise.


Outstanding.  Wear with a style printed blue and white long sweater to the office.  Or, wear along with gold jewelry and you will turn all the heads at the local bar & grill.  Work it ladies!


It's a little snugged along the bust area, but a draped scarf will do the trick,


Is a really nice dress.  Maybe just not for my bodyshape.  The blue is not as dark as online pic. I try to give it to my sister but too big for her.  So will be returning.  Thanks
