great dress


This dress was perfect for a work Christmas party! Very comfortable and hit right at the knees.


Very classy dress


I love this dress!  It fits perfectly. The material is not too hot.


Wayyyy too small.  I ordered a size Small as I am a size 0-2 and this would go over my shoulders or pull up over my hips!  I wonder if it was made for a child's size small?  Didn't matter, anyway as the material was cheap and the black color was off.  It was not at all what I expected.


Great price! Great dress!


beautiful


I got a lot of compliments on this dress.  I ordered a size up after reading the reviews, but should have gone with the size chart instead.  I wear a size 12 pant and am 5'7'' 34DDD and the stomach area of the XL was a little baggier than I would have liked, but not really visible to anyone but me.


I have not wore my dress yet , but when I tried it on it fits to my size and I love it .


LOVE THE DRESS AND FIT.
