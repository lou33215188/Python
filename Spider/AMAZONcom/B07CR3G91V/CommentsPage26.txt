This dress is a good buy . I am 5'3" , it reaches below my knees . Fit as expected . The only thing I didn't like was the sleeves . Still on the fence about keeping it returning .


This dress is VERY FIGURE FLATTERING.  I absolutely LOVE the way it fits my body and makes you look curvy yet still thin.


I wear size 6 dress and im a 34ddd , 5'3 130lbs , im small in the bottom, my body is a little like a v shape  , i ordered a small (4-6)  it fits good  at the top but a bit tight in the bottom knee area , not see through  , its a  stretchy material. maybe it might stretch more after washing  and multiple  use . Next time it would be wise to order 2 different sizes to try on  and return one.


Iam 5.2

Fit loose not as tight as I wanted


And the leg design looks cheap


exactly as pictured - very pleased.  Fabric is NOT cheap and see through, it's a great quality dress.  LOVE this vendor, looks like it came from a high-end department store


This DOES NOT fit as it looks.  The gathers in the front are too much and you appear pregnant. Returned.


The only thing that I didn't like about the dress, was that it was very big around the hips. If you don't have hips I wouldn't suggest it, but maybe I just got a defect. Definitely returned the dress.


I tried on the the dress and its a good fit but I was hoping for a deeper purple.Anyway, its okay a bit cheap looking but for the price you get what you get. Overall, I'll give it a three.


As others have stated, the material is great as fits well on the body. I usually wear a size large and it fit just right; I’m 5’7” 165lbs. Didn’t have any issues with the mid section where the material scrunches up. Would buy again from the company.


The fit and material was more then I expected. Material is soft, zipper functions properly.Length is exactly what I wanted. Looking forward to my next purchase.
