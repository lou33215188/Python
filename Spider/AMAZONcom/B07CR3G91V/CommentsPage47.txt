Gorgeous, amazing price and quality. Fits perfectly, sized up for a little looser fit. Highly recommend!


I don't like this dress for me, but it looks great on my daughter. So I gave it to her.


Best dress I purchased from Amazon so far !! Fit is perfect. It looks elegant yet stylish


Looks great for the price. I highly recommend


Cute!! Fit like it was made for me. Vibrant red. Looks a little on the cheap side but can be dressed up easily with nice accessories.


Not too sure about the design of the front with the ruffle for me. Looks better on a full figured body type to me. I am 120lbs.


Well made...nice thick material....will repurchase in another color
