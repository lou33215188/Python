The quality of the dress is good.i bought a medium and i'm 145lbs and it fits well.the only problem is that the middle section is a bit big but alterations can probably help with that.


Perfect dress. The dress quality was perfect and true to size. I bought an XL and it fitted perfectly. I received a lot of comments about how nice the dress looks on me. Great product!!!!!


Great!!!, I really impressed my wife with this dresses and made good points with her this time. Thank you Miusol


Fit well. Received before time frame.


Nice dress.


Very cute and super affordable


Love it...it was a great hit at my holiday party


Wow. This dress is so flattering and beautiful, especially for the price. I am 5'2, 120 lbs, and bought a size small in the black color. It is a little tight, but I prefer it that way. Could have gotten away with a medium, too though.


I liked the fit of the dress but the fabric looked a little cheap but that's probably why the dress was inexpensive. The fabric is stretchy and that was a plus.


Nice quality material.
