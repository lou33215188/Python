Very beautiful, I like it very much!


I ordered an XXL size 16 fit perfect


Very flattering dress. Material is thicker than expected, which gives it both good stretch and structure.


Nice dress


The fabric is very cheap


Fit perfectly!


Excelent


Great fabric, fit perfect! So happy with it.


This dress is my new favorite! I ordered the navy in my size(large-10/12). It fit a little snug, but not too tight. I got so many compliments that I ordered it in purple in an XL. The purple is more like a cranberry color. It's so comfortable, classy, and easy to wash. 5 Stars!!!
