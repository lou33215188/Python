Beautiful. ..!!


I bought for my wife and she love it.


Snug.  Great material.. Did not ride up.


Nice dress fits excellent


Fit as expected. I wear a medium in all of my dresses


Size chart is wrong


Not true to tag size. Much smaller


Fit was slightly smaller than anticipated.  I had ordered another dress in Medium and it fit perfectly.  Other than that the dress looks wonderful and quite slimming so my girlfriend says.  If you're wondering about the material it is fairly thick and stretchy.


Love it!


This dress is gorgeous. I looked very classy, and sophisticated in this dress.
