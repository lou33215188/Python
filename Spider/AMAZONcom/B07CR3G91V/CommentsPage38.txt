Love it!  I tried this dress on and thought I am in love.  I bought a Large.  I am 5'2'', 155 lbs and I ordered a Large.  This dress fit like glove, with a thick fabric that helps to hold things in.  Love it!


First one I got was way to small. Order the Medium and it was perfect!


Fits great and material is qualify.  Exactly The Retro look indeed!


This dress exceeded my expectations and made for a great night! Not only did the dress look just like the pictures, but it also makes your stomach look a little flatter. I ordered two sizes up, it fit perfectly, and the material was thick and stretchy. I love having room to breath!


Ok, I was a little skeptical on how this dress would fit,  but it fits in all the right places! It's definitely a show stopper! I get lots of compliments when I wear it and most people think I paid a lot out money for it! Very pleased!


The ruffle in the front is awkward and unflattering


I bought this dress for a work function. I was comfortable, pretty & the length was appropriate


I ordered a XXL. I'm a size 16. The dress is stretchy and thick and the XXL was slightly too loose for my taste. The main issue is there's too much  fabric in the tummy area, so it's not very flattering on me. It might fit someone with a little bit more roundness in that area. Thick fabric, beautiful fall/winter dress. I just wished the dress fit better. I won't be returning it for an XL because I usually get XLs from this company and I know it will be slightly snug, so I plan on adjusting this one to fit me better.


Looked great just too snug


Fabric is very thin. I returned it due to the fabric quality and length being too long.
