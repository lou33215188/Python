The dress was amazing I bought a size larger just in case it was to small so I had to make some minor adjustments but it looked great afterwards ,the material was thick so it didn't look cheap it was a great buy at a great price .


The material is really thick which makes it a little tight


Love this dress!!!


This dress is great quality, super flattering and cute! I ordered in navy, and will likely get a second color as well. Tons of compliments!


Beautiful dress,smelled pretty terrible.


I ordered a Medium based on other reviews but I need a small. Too much space in the stomach and lower back area. Love the dress though returning for a smaller size.


Great material! Highly recommend.


Beautiful. I am an xsmall, but I read this dress ran small so I ordered the small and it fits great. It is a little long and goes well below my knee but looks amazing on.


GORGEOUS!!!!  The dress is the perfect little black dress.  I couldn't be happier with it...


Dress fits well she looked lovely in it just wonderful
