This dress was great. It was true to size, looked like the pictures and well made.


It’s a pretty dress, just didn’t fit well. I would try an XS is it existed but it doesn’t.


This dress is sooo adorable. Omg I'm 5.9 and 135 and was scared it's going to run short but oh no it was perfect just like in the picture. I ordered a medium it's great.


Very Comfy and true to size. The chart is a huge help


It is an excellent choice for a cocktail or casual dress. Their color and material are perfect. I am very happy with the purchase. I definitely recommend it.


beautiful dress


I love this dress! The material is perfect for a fall/winter event as its pretty thick. It looks just like the picture. Can't wait to wear it! Will post pictures soon.


Dress was beautifully made. Fabric super quality and fit better than I thought it would


Beautiful dress, great quality and fabric. Fits snug though, I ordered M should have ordered L


The dress is nice and fits as expected, however, it was a bit more ruffles than the picture seemed to be - not that it was advertised incorrectly, but my interpretation of the pic may just be different.
