Love this dress for work! True to size. Very flattering


I really liked the dress however, I wear a XL because of the material I ordered a XXL and it was still too small. I had to return it.


beautiful color


It came with a black stain on the front.  The fabric seamed cheap, and the bunching on the front was not complimentary.


Lovely material and color but very snug. Order up a size


Looked great on me...somewhat loose along the waistline, but perfect otherwise.


Love it! Fits perfect.  Will be ordering more of this brand.


Fits great! Looks professional.


Runs a little small.
