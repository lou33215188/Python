I've received so many compliments for this dress.  I usually wear a size 8 but I didn't want the dress to fit so tight so I ordered up one size and it fit great.


I love this dress. It's absolutely gorgeous. I bought this dress for a funeral but it can be paired nicely with a colored pump for a date night.


Dress material is smooth and soft, but it will cling to curves a bit. Size runs small


It is a great dress for the price. I am 5'2" and about 136lbs and the medium fit perfectly.


The material is stretchy so it has room. A XL would have been a better fit for me


This is a beautiful dress.  I love the modern stylish look of it.  I wear a size 12-14, but I had to order this dress in a XXL.


Really a nice dress
