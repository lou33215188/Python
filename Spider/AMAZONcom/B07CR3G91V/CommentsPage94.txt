Great Fit! Nice quality fabric.


Love this dress! It is a great fabric. It looks elegant. Super flattering! I am 5'3 weigh 129 lbs and pear shaped. I got a Medium and it was perfect. I will definitely buy from this brand again.


Didn't like poor quality


Follow sizing guide. I wear 12 and lx works fine.


Love it & true to size!!!


Fit as expected!


This dress is amazing! Very flattering! I was sure to purchase the dress based on the measurements. If you are curvy, it accentuates your shape.


For some reason i've got quite another model and was very dissappointed. I returned it back.


Very figure flattering.


Get this dress. Love it the material is thick and sturdy there is also stretch.
