Love the dress very elegant as pictured quality of the material is great. Unfortunately have to return for a size larger because didn't like how fit around stomach area besides that ...can't wait to get the correct size to wear it


I'm in-between sizes right now, 14 - 16, so, I ordered the XL bases on reviews. The fit is snug but cute. The material is nice and gives in to my curves. Since I don't show my arms too often, pairing this with a nice blazer creates magic! Love it.


Didn’t look good on me !


I’m 5 ft and 112 lbs. the small fit me perfectly.  Had s great date night with my husband and received compliments on the dress.  The purple actually came out to be a deep red color.


I am hippy, when I walk quickly it rids up a little. I've worn it more than once I could live with it.


Love the material. It's a beautiful dress


Love, love, love this dress.  I purchased it in black and wore it to dinner and my husband loved it on me.  I'm 5'0 119, D cup (toned/muscular) and bought the size small and it fits perfectly!


Lovely dress. Wore it to a Christmas party. It was a bit fitted but the quality of the dress was very nice and I got lots of compliments


Very good work dress. Tons of compliments.


This is now my favourite dress to wear to work! I always get compliments when I wear it and it is super comfortable and well made!
