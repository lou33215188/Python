I am 5'8, 173, and it fit well. I ordered a Lg. I was very happy with my purchase.


This dress is perfect! Yes it runs small but that is disclosed on the sizing, so go off the chart. The color is rich, I got the navy blue. The material is amazingly great. I was not expecting this because of the price. It's a dress that will be in my closet for a while. I am a thicker women and it was flattering to my shape. I look forward to shoping this brands dresses for other occasions I have coming up! Heck, I'll be stocking up my closet for this price to have on hand for the holidays! Don't think twice, just get it! You won't regret it!


I bought this dresss to attend a wedding. It was very flattering. The material of the dress is thick, hit my knees, and like a cap sleeve. Overall I felt great in the dress and can't wait to wear again. I wear a size 8-10 and a medium fit perfect. I'm busty, have hips and a butt.


I bought this dress for my daughter , who loves to wear dresses. She's 5'9 and size 12.Just to let you know these dresses run small.This is my third order from Miusol's,the first one was the black swing dress;second a gown and now this purple dress.Now if you want to be true to yourself know your correct size and order the right size.I ordered a 2x for her knowing that she's tall and slim with hipsğŸ˜Š.Miusol's dresses are quality. Ladies you might want to order some of these quality dresses.


As a sports reporter this dress is the perfect mix of professional, cute and comfort. I got so many compliments broadcasting the pregame show for the Chicago Blackhawks. Got in in orange too for my Chicago Bears pregame show Monday.


I was so skeptical at first, but I ordered 8 different Miusol dresses in a small just to give it a try. Must say, I love them all! It's a huge relief because I hate returning things. They all fit my body perfectly and its stretchy enough so I don't even need the zipper. I'm 5'6" 125lbs.


Great buy, looks good and is affordable! Can't wait til new styles come out :)


I bought one size up, according to the chart, and while the dress fit okay, it was really too big.  I sized down and it fits like a glove.  Nice quality material too. I wish I would have ordered the navy instead of black because the ruffles seemed to stand out more with the navy.


In love with this dress!!! Great material and fits perfectly! Such a great deal for the price! I wore it to my work Christmas party and it was definitely a hit!


Love this dress! The material is thick but not heavy. Is fitted but not too tight. Lays beautiful and created an hourglass shape. I'm typically a size 10/12 bought an XL and I'm 5'6. Dress hits mid Knee. Wonderful online purchase.


This is a wow dress.  Color (purple) is great and it fits really well.  I ordered a size up (normally a L but got an XL) so I can wear it to work without being to va-va-va-voom.  Good idea.  It's still form flattering and professional. The material is also pretty thick which is forgiving on curves.


Update: I lost 7 pounds and decided to order the black this time in a size large.  It fits perfect and looks just as good as the purple.  This is a must have in any wardrobe.  You can literally wear it anywhere and it will be appropriate.  I received many compliments on it too.
