Dress fits like a glove it's perfect for the office or a party. Will buy more from this vendor


I get SO many compliments on this. It is extremely flattering and the length is very appropriate!


Really nice dress for the price!  I'm 5'8, 175lbs.  I ordered a 2XL because of my shoulders & chest.


Love my dress!! Wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments!


Too small poor material


This dress is beautiful! It fits like a glove. Loved it so much I bought it in black, red and navy :)


Love this dress! I am 5'7", 196 lbs & it fit me perfectly! The ruching helps camouflage my tummy too :) Good quality fabric, stretchy & comfortable.


The color is brighter than the picture but it fits amazing!


I ordered a size up according to other reviews but it was still a bit snug but I made it work.  I like it overall.


Great Dress - Love it - Fit perfectly
