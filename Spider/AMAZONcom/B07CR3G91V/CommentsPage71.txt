It fit well but it just made my shoulders look boxy and huge. It was not flattering on me, but perhaps on a different body type. It would look great on a petite frame.


I would like to repurchase this dress again but I think the next size a extra large would just be to big.


The fit is great.


Love this dress, I got so many nice compliments.  very nice material. you will absolutely love it..


Love love love


LOVE LOVE LOVE


Top was great but the rouching/gathering at the waistline was baggy and weird. This is getting returned, unfortunately. I really wanted to love it.


I love the way this dressfits my body. This was my first time ordering from Amazon and I must say I am pleased. I will definitely order again real soon from Amazon.


Fits perfectly.  Had many compliments.


I did not like the material. It did not look that great on me.
