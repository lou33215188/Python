Love this but since I'm currently in the process of losing weight I"m going to keep it. It looks too good on me just a tad snug. For the price it's worth  it anyway. Hopefully I fit into it soon!  :D


Perfect fitted, vibrant color. I usually wore M/L or size 10 and size L of this dress work for me. I’m 5’2 and 150 lbs


This dress is so flattering! I'm a fit curvy 160 5' 3" 36c. I read the reviews and decided to order a XL even though my normal dress size would be an 8. Absolutely stunning, flattering dress for a mother of two! Hides the baby pooch and accents all the assets! I'd highly recommend!


I am 5'5 200lbs and ordered a XXL and it fits great. Wore it to a funeral but Will also wear it to work


Perfect fit. Super cute. I have it in red and blue.  I love this dress.


Beautiful dress. Very comfy fabric and great design. I bought a xl . I am 5'5 ,38d, 32 inch waist and it is lovely.


love love love this dress. i was nervous at first because i am on the plus sixe normally wearing a size 16 so i bought the 2xl and it was the perfect fit. will definitely buy from seller again


Beautiful dress, but it runs small. I suggest ordering one size up. I didn't end up returning it because it's so pretty. I gave it to my skinny sister!!


Nice fabric, quality fine for it's purpose. It's just not a dress for those of us with bosoms and I'm only a 36 C.  Fit fine everywhere but in the top.Just cut really high waisted.


Great fit. Very curvy girl friendly. Nice thick material (worn in December in New England). Would buy again!
