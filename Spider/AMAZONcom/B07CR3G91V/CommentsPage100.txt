This dress fits very nicely, with some forgiving fabric, and flatters the shoulders. The fabric is a little thin, so bra and panty lines are quite visible- plan accordingly!


Love it!! Great material


This is such a wonderful dress - and is slightly stretchy.  I am normally and size 4 with a small busy and ordered a 4 and it fits perfect.  I would suggest sizing up if your busy is larger because this fits me like a glove.


Looks and feels like an expensive sheath dress.  Only suggestion to the designer and seamstress is to improve the stitching around the neckline.  It is large and will be viewed the most as it is around your neckline.  A less noticeable, tight stitch would be more appropriate.


I ordered two other colors.  Conservative yet sexy - isn't that what all women want to have for the business environment?  I love it.


excelent!!


Fits nicely. I got a lot of compliments!


Dress sizes run small. Quality was not what I was expecting. Looked nicer in the picture.


I weigh 170 and is 5'2 and the XL fit just right and length goes pass my knees slightly.  Material is good, not cheap looking. Would recommend and will buy in another color.


Love the dress, just order 1-2 sizes UP.


Dress fits true to size and slimming. Great dress!


This is now one of my favorite dresses. I bought a medium, my package arrived on time & it fits perfectly.
