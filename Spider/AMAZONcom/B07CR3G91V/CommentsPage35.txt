love this dress, ordered the navy in small and I was more than pleasantly surprised. I am ordering it in the other colors as well. It is so comfortable. If it helps- I am usually ordering in tops medium to small. I am about  5'4 130 I think.... its fitted but not crazy tight, going to be great for work, it comes right past my knees which is what I wanted- professional look but can easily go straight into evening. highly recomend


Fits great looks so pretty can not wait to wear it for Christmas ğŸ˜€


Love this dress. I bought a bigger size to make sure it fit. I didn't need to. The dress fit as it should. But it's cotton so may shrink if you wash at home. It's great for curvy women.


Really wanted a hot red dress for some time now. I came across this 1 & decided to order based on the excellent reviews. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! The fabric is forgiving. Its thick & had a lot of stretch to it so it fits like a glove. The pleting in the tummy area helps to hide problem areas. Thinking about ordering it in black.


This is the cutest dress. I'm always really worried about online shopping, but this dress feels and looks as though it is made for me! It is so soft, and the fit is impeccable!! It is a little long through, so I will need to get it hemmed. But I am very short (only 5'2") so genetics are more at fault than the dress. Overall, I am extremely pleased. For sizing help, I am 5'2", 130 lbs and I ordered a Medium.


Love this dress-the fit is perfect as it's snug but doesn't feel too tight or look too tight making it perfect for the office. I get so many compliments on this dress!


Saying I love this dress isn't enough. It is everything


Loved the dress! Got soo many compliments, curves to your body nicely. Only downside is that the dress does run small, I followed the size guidelines too. May be it would've fit nicer if I had ordered the next size up.


This dress is beautiful and flattering for any body type.  The material is flexible, a bit thick, but this does show off your body and hides your belly, at least it did mine.


Although I love this dress, it just doesn't fit my body as it should. So I am returning it. I would like to say that the dress is beautiful and I wish it fit. It's a pretty color and nicely made with wonderful material. I would not hesitate to purchase this dress but pay attention to the sizing.
