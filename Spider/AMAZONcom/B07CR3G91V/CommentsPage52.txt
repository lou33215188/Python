Poor fabric.  Not as pretty as pictured.  Will give to goodwill.


Love it! Great price great dress, great quality


Beautiful dress, just a tiny bit smallish.  Fits snug.


Normally wear US L/XL but i bought a 2xl and it fits great even tough the belly area have a little more tissue but it ok.


Wow, I will buy more dresses from this brand. Amazing for the price. It fit perfectly! Also true to color.


received a lot of compliments.  Love the dress, color and material


Awesome dress for the price! Washed well, fits as expected.


Ordered normal size. Way too small. Returned.


This dress is nice but it does not fit my mid section. In the positive, it's well made. The quality is good. If I had time I would get the mid section tailored but I don't want to take a chance. Sending it back.


I bought a large instead of a medium, my mistake.


Dress is beautiful, classy, loved  it.


The length i is perfect,I took a but from the sides and badge it like a pencil skirt, tighter from the hips down.


Definitely will buy again. Check the sizes, they are true.
