Usually wear a medium but decided to purchase a large. It was very form fitting and would require appropriate under garment if you are curvy. Not to impress with the material of the dress. I was drawn to the ruffles and overall style of the dress.


Nice dress! Fits well, get a size up! I'm 5foot 7 and it's just above knee, wish it was a little longer! But nice dress! Good quality!!!


This is not recommended for smaller, petite women. A S was still way too big, particularly in the stomach area.  The ruching would be flattering on someone who fills out the midsection completely but if you don't fill it out, it just sags and bulges.  In order for this to fit nicely, it needs to be very tight on you, from top to bottom.


I got more than a dozen compliments today- all thanks to this dress. The color, fabric, cut... everything is perfect and this dress was dirt cheap! Going to buy in every color now. So happy! Btw- bought a Large and it's true to size.


Very pretty and I love the fabric.  Very flattering. I'm a size 8 and I ordered the Medium.  It fits me well - the next size smaller would be too tight for my liking.


This dress fit me just right and in all the right places! I really recommend it to others/  The material was comfortable and soft and fit perfect with the attire for my choir on Sunday morning!


This dress is amazing!  It is high quality and fits perfectly.  It hits right on the knee for length too.  I'm 5'10' 150lbs and ordered a large.  I do have an athletic build.  Will definitely be buying more from this label


Beautiful dress and quality I ordered a medium which is my size but the bust area was a bit to tight I will have to order a large .. but other than that this dress is lovely


I got a medium and the fit was very flattering! I wore it for 8 hours and it was comfortable! I will order more colors!


Absolutely love this dress, hugs and accentuates all the right areas. I am 5'5" and weigh about 175. I usually wear sizes 10-12 or a L/XL, depending on the cut (it can get tricky). I'm not sure if these are in Asian sizes but I started off with the Large and it was too tight for my liking (in terms of leg room and pulling in the hip area)... It pulled around the waist, which is meant to have a little room based on its design. I went ahead and ordered an XL... perfect! A little bit of cleavage, and hugs nicely, accentuates your curves but not too tight or too small looking... very sexy dress, perfect for date night, work or even church. I would say order a size up. I have both colors ğŸ˜�


I now have all three colors... wish there were more color options, I would get them too! I was about 165 when I ordered the XL. Now that I weigh, 175, I would probably get it in a 2X so that it isn't too fitted. I am still wearing the XL and it is as sexy as can be ;)
