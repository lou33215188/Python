Another winner.


This dress looks lovely in the picture, the length is perfect but a bit big. My wife is slim but has medium size hips, she has to get it altered. I think the material is too thick for this style with ruffles.


I ordered this dress for a banquet. I was a little nervous but to my surprise the dress was just as described and fit me perfectly! Im 5'6" and about 160 lbs and I ordered a Large.


I normally wear a 2XL in Amazon dresses, but this one had a tight fit. It's a nice dress if you can find your size.


Looks sexy on, I must say.  I would recommend it.  I look forward to wearing it to an event soon.


Didn't fit very well!


This dress is well made and very cute.  If I wasn't trying to hide the mid-section I would have kept it.  It hugs everything!


The dress is very beautiful. It is very form fitting, and I am not comfortable in a dress that shows all of my curves, so I am returning it.


Very pretty and perfect for the wedding I went to.


I love it! Fits well and it's very classy! I am planning to wear this to an afternoon wedding and I wanted to wear a dress that would take me out of my normal "style zone". I ordered a XL and with my push-up bra and control briefs this dress will be perfect!!!
