I like this dress. I ordered it for a wedding. My only complaint is the middle section. It doesn't lay flat but it's still wearable.


This dress is ugly in person.


Two thumbs down!!


Amazing dress!! Fits like a glove. I'm 5'2" 135lbs and the small was perfect! Got so many compliments. Love it!!


Have not had a chance to wear it, will update then.  But it did look nice on me.


Fitting was oÄ·  the material not like


Amazing fit and very classy for a cocktail event. I am normally a size 16, got the XXL and it fit perfectly. I got the dress in black and the material looked great. You can't beat this dress for the price! One of many Miusol dresses I've purchased from Amazon and the quality is better than some expensive dresses I've bought.


Pretty!


Beautiful dress on!  It hits every curve classicly!


Fits great
