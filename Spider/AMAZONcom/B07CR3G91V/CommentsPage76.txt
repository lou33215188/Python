I like the length but the dress wasnt as fitted as expected especially  around the waiste


Wow this dress is red hot and sultry! Many compliments on it. Makes me feel super sexy. Fits as as expected! Hubby can't take his eyes off me when I wear it. Super comfy too!


I love this dress


Cute!


This dress was professional with a little hint of sexy...LOVE IT!!!


I love this dress, but unfortunately realized too late it was a little too form fitting for my office. Great for a night out!


Love this dress.  A true red. It is a good stretchy material, although it does have a slight bit of room in the belly, which is good for those trying to hide a bit.  The flares on the sleeves give it just what it needs to not be too plain.


NEGATIVE STAR! So disappointed in this buy! I read the reviews and was looking forward to wearing this for a wedding and it got here with a broken  zipper and zipper would come down! I couldn't even try it on!


Great fit!


Excellent
