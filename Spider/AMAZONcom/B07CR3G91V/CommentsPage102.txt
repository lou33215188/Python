Iâ€™m 5â€™4, 175 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fitted perfectly. Material was nice.


I liked the dress, but it was not for me.  I did not like the fabric and it was tight!!


Fantastic, recommend this highly, dark blue was the color of my wife's dress


Fabric was soft and comfortable. Fits true to size. Very pleased with the purchase


I'm happy to brought this dress, very cute and can wear it to many occasions ğŸ’�


Great fit and nice looking dress. The material is just right and I love how it hugs my body. I will be ordering another one in a different color.


Perfect fit, good material. I am 5,7 . chest 36, waist 56, hips 39, ordered size s and fit as expected
