Cute but size stated doesn't fit the size I am.


Nice fit, Iâ€™m 6 ft tall and went all the way to me knees!


A little too much lose fabric over the stomach..


The colour was not the true colour but it fit well, nice length and very comfortable for work....got compliments about the dress....


The overall fit was great.  Definitely would recommend.  The navy color was great and i received several complements


Beautiful dress. Nice material. I'm 5ft 4 with 115 lbs. I bought size S and it fits great.


Ordered a small, received a large. Looked nothing like what was pictured. Tried to give it a shot but oh well. Heading straight back.


Great matieral! Very thick, good durable quality. A good buy for the price. Also it is very body hugging so make sure you order accordingly.


great dress and fit...and the price was very reasonable


Great quality nice dress just like the picture


They sent wrong size, didn't bother trying on. Ordered Miusol before and fit true to size and looked great. Please double check what you're packing.
