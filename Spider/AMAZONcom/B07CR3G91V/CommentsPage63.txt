Beautiful!  I can't wait to wear it this weekend to a wedding. I tried it on and it fits amazing and is so comfortable.


Perfect fit. Beautiful design and nice material. Couldn't be happier!


I love this dress it fits me perfect and material is excellent for the price


I have the blue and red. I ordered the blue in XL and it fit just right. The red I ordered an XXL and it still fit great just gave me a little more room.


I really loved this dress.


Material is stretchy. Fits well.


loved! Great for. Will order again.


I bought this dress in black and loved it so much that I bought it in red as well. Super easy to throw on and perfect for work or happy hour.


I'm normally between an xs and small. I went with the small because they didn't have xsmalls. It was huge on me. Also, the sleeves are very strange. They point out almost like small wings. Do not recommend.


Perfect beautiful dress!
