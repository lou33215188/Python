I order 3 ot them very nice but have to return it the this one because it was too large.


I have small boobs in comparison to my wide hips. I took in a few inches at the waist, but otherwise, it fitted nicely. I receive many compliments.


I've become addicted. No more sinus troubles... It's so refreshing!!!!


This is a really nice dress. The material is thick and nice.


Best dress ever! I wore this dress to an outreach event and received numerous compliments throughout the day! I felt like a model!  Fits great, true to size, very complimentary!


Med is too big


The dress fits, but looks cheaply made.


Fits great and has great material


Material is ok could be better. But overall the dress was lovely


Great fabric, great color. The fit was great on top, but too small at my hips and I don't wear dresses that I have adjust every time I stand up.
