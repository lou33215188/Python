The dress was a good fit, received so many compliments.


Nice dress!


the color is navy blue but when i receive this dress it look like stone wash like blue, i was so upset !!!!!


I had to get it in an XL because the L was too little. I am a 12 in dresses. I love the style. The material is thick and it hugs all your curves.


Material is thick, the blue looks a little faded and not as rich as the photo. It is fitted but not skin tight.


It looks so good and a great price. The material is very stretchy and forgiving.


The material was thick but very stretchy. Not ideal if you live in Arizona like I do. There was too much room in the top and I have a D cup.


I usually don't write reviews but I had to for this dress. It had no give, no stretch or spandex. Which makes it had to put on over curves. Have to return it.


Love this dress.  The material is thick and not see through which is great. The fit is as expected.  I am about 210lb and the 2XL fits perfect.


I generally wear a medium, but after reading the reviews, I ordered a small and it fit perfectly. It was tight enough to show off my curves but not so tight to be uncomfortable or tacky. The material is good quality, thick enough not to require any extra layers and can somewhat disguise the use of form enhancing undergarments. I wore this for a business dinner at a very high end private restaurant, and it was perfect for the occasion.
