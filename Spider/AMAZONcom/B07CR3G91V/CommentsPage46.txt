This DRESS is FABULOUS!!!!


Very nice dress, it runs a little big but I did like it!


Nice, flattering dress.  I'm 5'7" and the dress hits just below the knee.


This is a really nice dress and does a good job hiding any imperfections.


The dress really looks pretty in the picture it is not very attractive in person. The ruffles are not as attractive as I thought they would be.I thought without the ruffles the dress would have been a simple pretty dress..returned it.


Beautiful dress a little too tight.


I did not like the style of this dress once I put it on.  This is a fitted dress and hangs funny on me. I am returning this one.


FIT WELL DO FIT BODY SHAPE RECOMMEND ONE SIZE BIGGER


This dress is everything that it says. It fits perfectly and because of its elasticity it hugs you in all the right places. It isn't a dark navy. More violet navy, but I'm so happy with my purchase I may order in black.


Fits too tight. Too small as compared to other Muisol dresses. I have plenty!
