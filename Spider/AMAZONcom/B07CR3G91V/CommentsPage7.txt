I was a little skeptical ordering this dress for a holiday party, but this dress was so perfect for the occasion.


I receive the dress yesterday and it was double packed. I mean I guess the previous buyer tear the plastic, didnt like the dress and returned it. What they did was used the same plastic packaging and placed it in another plastic. I dont mind, the dress still has the tags and everything. I tried it on and like the other reviews, it hugs your body. The ruffle detail at the front of the dress hides your tummy plus it made it look like the dress is so flowy. The material is not heavy too, I think I can get a lot of use for this dress so planning to buy in another color.


This is a really nice dress. It's made well using a stretchy durable material. I did receive lots of compliments when I wore it and was told the dress was slimming. Bonus! I ordered an XL and I normally wear a 14-16. It fit like a glove. This dress is a steal for the price. If you're on the fence, order it. It's worth it.


Oh my this dress is of good quality nice thick material and dont get me started on the fit omg wow shows off all my curves im 226lbs and I got the 2x


This dress is gorgeous, especially for the price. This will be great to wear to work. It fits like a glove and really shows off your curves, while still looking very classy! My only complaint is it's a bit longer than I would prefer, but if you're taller this may not be an issue. For reference I'm 5'4" and 135lbs and the medium fits great!


My dimensions are 35-28-38, and I ordered a size MEDIUM based on reviews, which was much too big in the waist, and much too tight in the hips. The shoulder caps were also too wide for me, and I usually have the opposite problem. As the other reviews say, this dress is good for someone with relatively narrow hips and wider shoulders. The fabric, color, and finish are nice. The dress is a good value if it fits.


I love this dress! Flattering for curvy figures for sure! I weight 145 and am 5'8 and the medium fit perfectly!


I was a little skeptical on this dress but it had so many good reviews and I needed something for an upcoming party that was â€œcocktail attireâ€�. I liked that this dress is dressy/â€œsexyâ€� enough for cocktail attire but also classy and could be worn to work or church.  I sized up based on reviews and am happy with the size (I just had a baby and was nervous about something super tight - 5â€™2â€� 160 lbs - bought XL).  This fits very nicely.  Loose but not baggy.  I feel like I could have gone with a large and it would have still looked nice.  The fabric is very nice quality and the dress is very comfortable.  I love the ruffle detail - hides my postpartum belly ğŸ˜œ.  I will definitely look at other dresses from Miusol in the future.


The dress is beautiful and the quality is excellent considering the price. I'm 5'0" 163 lbs and ordered a Large and it fit like a glove, which I wanted. Unfortunately, I had to return the dress because the red was brighter than the other dresses in the wedding party I am a part of. I would have kept the dress if I ordered it in a darker color, but I ordered it in red because that is the color that was required by the bride. I may order this dress again in a darker color just to have it on hand for special occasions or to wear to work.


LOVEEEEE BUY IT! THIS DRESS LOOKS RICH AND IS GREAT QUALITY..GO UP ONE SIZE IF YOUR BETWEEN SIZES. Im a 12/13 5'5 and 170 pounds, XL WAS PERFECT. Im buying it again in a different color!
