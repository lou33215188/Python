Very good quality material- thick enough so that it could hide shapewear if needed but thin enough to be worn in a hot church for a very lengthy graduation ceramony. Fit great but I think ordered a bit large based on the reviews and got a medium when a small may have fit better- I had the waist taken in a bit and had good room for hips and chest. I am 5'3" and weight 140 with an athletic figure but it very nicely gave the illusion of fuller hips! Lol!!


10/10 perfect fit


Bought this for a wedding got a medium fit perfectly. Good price for a nice dress

I ordered a small and should have ordered a medium... cut small but very cute & sassy & sexy
