I was satisfied with my order and shipment. Delivered as described.


perfect dress!!! Im a 36D and 29-30waist and 41" hips . I weigh 148-155 and 5'2" and this medium was great!!


My second favorite dress. Looks gorgeous. Shipped on time.


Very happy with this purchase - decently made and fit perfectly.


tight fit... buy one size up..


The dress is nice.  A little smaller than expected, but fits well.  The material seems more cotton as well


Love this dress! So comfy and fits very well. I'm 5'2"/120/32D and I ordered a small. Perfect dress for Christmas dinner.


The material is thick and nice, large fits perfect. I Love it and its great work.


Amazing dress for the price. Perfect for the office.


Nice thick stretchy material..My only drawback is that I should have ordered a size up. I wear an XL/16 but should have ordered a 2XL for extra room around the tummy area..nothing a shapewear couldn't fix.
