I really like the dress. It gathers a little weird at one of the pelts but is not easily noticed. I followed the size chart, and it fit perfectly.


Very good quality but tight fit.


Omg!!! Dress so pretty. Fit me so well. Im small frame so I like to find things that fit me well. Quality material worth the price and more!


DEFECTIVE, DO NOT BUY.


Perfect fit. Loved the dress!


Pretty, flattering and appropriate for work. Buy.


Just love it


This dress looks great. My measurements are 34-B, 30, 42 clearly bottom heavy and weigh 155.  I typically wear size 10 and some 8's depending on the material. This dress fit perfect in a Medium.


I am usually a perfect XL. However, the dress was more snug than I like and the fabric was not what I was hoping for, polyester would have been a better choice of fabric. Love the style though.


Good look
