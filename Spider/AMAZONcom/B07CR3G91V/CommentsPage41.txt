Little long, will hem Otherwise PERFECT


Overall it's a dress but it's not as described material is not worth of buying , runs small, and overall doesn't look like on the picture at all returning


I loved this dress so much I bought it in both colors. It is very classy and it fits my curves very nicely. I recommended it to my boss and she purchased it as well. She loved it!


She loves it.


Would like it if it was longer too.


Dress runs maybe one size smaller.  It's too dressy for work for me.


I usually do not trust a dress for such price but I am truly impressed with the design, fit and material. It is a steal for this price. I reduced the shoulder flaps so it does not look so dramatic otherwise it fits perfectly and very comfortable.


This dress is gorgeous!!!!!


Perfect fit and lovely design. So elegant and timelessly chic! This dress can be worn to a nice dinner or work-related summer event.


Great material. Fits great. I ordered a Medium and it reaches about 1.5 inches below my knee has some space by the waist. I'm 5 3''.


Order update. Just received a small in black, fits perfectly!!


Fits beautifully.
