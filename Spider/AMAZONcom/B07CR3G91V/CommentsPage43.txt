Very nice dress! Got lots of compliments.


Pretty and comfortable. Fits a pear shape well. Flattering on plus size figure -- order at least a size up.


Thick fabric. A little stretchy but not much. Love the dress!


This dress is not sized properly. It's way too tight/small.


way smaller than the measurements they posted, also the material looks cheap


This was one of the best purchases I made online. Absolutely love this dress! Very good quality and design. Highly recommend!


Gorgeous dress and well made. I LOVE it! I am a Small and I ordered a Small, it was a perfect fit.


Excelente shape and fit, very flattering. Just the right lenght


Super cute dress and perfect for work. Easy to iron. Washes good. The only thing I don't like about it is that it kinda bunches up around the waist (but I have a tiny waist) and it kinda rides up when I walk around.... that being said, I don't mind it and I've already worn it twice. Good quality for sure!


Cute dress but fits larger than expected so I returned.  I'd definitely start by ordering a size down than what you usually are, although I can't say for sure if that would be a better fit since I didn't try to exchange.  I just know my usual Medium was way too big to wear.
