The dress is really nice dress. The cap sleeves are really high for me. Other than that, the it is a nice dress. I did return the item.


Very nice dress for the price. I got several compliments at the office.


Lovely cut and style but the fabric screams cheap to me.


The sizing on Amazon size chart is spot on as long as you measure yourself and go with what will fit. This is not too snug and the color and material are beautiful! I highly recommend!


Fits very well... I weigh 180Ibs and most of my weight is hips so it looks very nice.. Plus it only took 2 days to receive my dress which was right in time for a B-day party I had to attend the next day..


Wore this dress to my daughter's graduation and received a lot of compliments. Dress fit perfectly.


This is a great dress. Fabric is not cheap looking at all. Normally wear a size 6 small fit just right on me.


I love this dress! It has a bit of stretch and is extremely comfortable! The fit is very flattering and I LOVE the color (I ordered purple)! The top detail is really nice. I ordered a size up based on other reviews. I am normally a size 6-8 and ordered a large. Fits perfect!


It's very difficult for especially busty women to take advantage of all the super cheap dresses from Azsia on Amazon. This one works. It looks good and didn't fall apart even after I wore it twice. Low expectations, maybe, but I was pleasantly surprised.


I am 5'6 and 170 lbs bought a large and dress fit perfect. I wore this dress to a wedding and felt like a million bucks.
