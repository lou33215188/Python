I had this sent fastest shipping possible as I needed to wear it to an immediate family member's funeral this weekend. Dress came in NAVY BLUE not BLACK!!!  It's a destination funeral & I have reordered, expedited shipping (again) & sent to my final destination. Praying it comes in black or I'm in BIG trouble!! The fit is gorgeous, by the way.


Edit: the new dress came just in time and in black. It was gorgeous!! I received many compliments on it and I felt beautiful in it.  It stood out, but was very discerning at the same time. A perfect dress for a funeral where black is the top color but your personality doesn't go away.


WAS NOT TRUE TO SIZE AT ALL.


My wife loves this dress also. I will be buying more in different colors.


Fit nicely


Way too small- maybe like a size 10 US but definitely not a 2XL for a plus size woman! I couldn’t even get it over my head. I’m 5’2 and about 240 pounds. I think the sizing is Asian or European. Sad because I really wanted to love this dress.


Ordered size small. I'm 125lb, 5'6" -fit like a glove! Love this dress. Goes to the knee. Perfect for office or evening attire!


My measurements are 36-32-36 and I'm 5'4". The dress molds to my body in some spots and bunches in a couple of other places where it's loose.  I ordered a large.Overall it fits fine. I was expecting knee length but at 5'4" it's a below the knee dress for me. It fits more like a pencil skirt and I'm fine with that.  It looks great with high heels.


like it


Great for work.  Good material for price


I ordered the dress in purple, when I got it, it wasn't purple it is maroon.  The dress has a nice fit, quality fabric, the purple dress is not purple.
