Very beautiful and comfortable dress! It runs small. I like material and colour (navy blue).


AMAZING MATERIAL!! - Literally feels like my Calvin Klein Dress that was over $90! - this one is beautiful & fits you all on the perfect spots! - I am buying the other 2 colors!


I got this dress today. Can't wait to wear it! It's absolutely beautiful. I always wear pants but now getting into dresses and so glad I purchased this one. Has a very flattering fit. I got the red one and it's a rich red. Very very pleased with this dress. Will definitely buy again from this company.


This dress is much cuter in the picture. I was pretty disappointed when I opened and it looks like a uniform and had an awkward length. I am 5"4' and the small went past my knees but not mid-calf. Probably more personal preference I either want my skirt at the knees or ankle not somewhere in between.


I purchased this dress in 3 colors and have received many compliments.  The quality is exceptional for the price.  The fabric is thick, the cut is very flattering and fits true to size.  I wear them to work (attorney) and work nicely for after work events. Also, machine washable makes it easy to care for.


A little fancier than I expected but this dress is ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥. Definitely worth buying and wearing out for a night of dancing!


The key to ordering from these Chinese brands online is to go up a few sizes from your regular size.  This dress is beautiful and I received so many compliments while wearing this dress.  I highly recommend this company and the quality is outstanding.


cute, heavy duty material. did wrinkle a bit when washed but that's ok. high quality material and thick. i really like it.


I should have paid closer attention to the description as being "pencil" cut.  Even so, the dress was way to small (I am 5 3, weigh 140 and measurements are 36 30 36.


Dress fits close/exact. I could use a little more room. It's consistent with about a size 6. Material is stretchy. Very long dress and can't wait to wear it.
