Love it


The dress was nice quality and pretty, but really made for a taller person. I am 5'1" and it was just not a good fit on someone with a short torso.


Love this dress. Curves to my body and its very comfortable. I received a lot of compliments.


I ordered a 2X which is usually my size but it was TOO Small. Cute dress though.


Omg i love my dress, not disappointed and arrived on time


Fits perfectly, she loved it very much


nice dress, was big in the stomach area, had some extra material there that did not flatter the dress.  returning, unfortunately.


Love my dress


It's a beautiful tailored dress made of thick stretchy material that flatters ones body. I love the dress!


This dress is perfect, buy size "M" I measure 5.1 and weight 160 lbs
