A must buy!! I got lots of comments today wearing this dress. Love it!


True to size fit.


Beautiful dress.


It really is a beautiful dress, but unfortunately I ordered a small and it was not only to long but to big. I am 5'1 and weigh 121lbs.


So I am returning it.


Pleasantly surprised. Nice material and great fit! Lots of compliments in this dress ğŸ’ƒ


I love it fits perfect, just the right length and the right color...it is as presented !


Happy I have my Christmas Dress early and very reasonable cost.


Love the way it fits. Can't wait until the weather warms up


Nice fit and good quality fabric


Love this dress. Received multiple compliments. Thick material. Can't see through. Plan to order in other colors.


Strange cut, didn't work for me at all but I am long waisted


The fit, fabric, color and style of this dress is awesome
