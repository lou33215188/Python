So many compliments!


I loved this dress! Nice, thick material, great lines, perfect for work! So impressed with the quality for the price. I will be buying more Miusol dresses!!! I will say I listened to the reviews that said it ran a little small and had to send one back- I'm about a 12/14 and I ordered the XL first, but had to send it back and get a large- so order true to size!!


I love it it fit the way I wanted


Great quality and exactly like the photos.  Size is on point.


I followed the size chart and fit as expected percentage and was way too large. Not sure if the dress was too large that made the front be too big or if the stitching is done incorrectly to get the effect in the model picture. The fabric has an odor as well. It's going back.
