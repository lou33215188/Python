Gave it to a friend and it looks fabulous on her.


It is sophisticated and elegant, quality of the dress is high I really loved this dress so much


I wish I'd bought a large vs the x-large, still fits okay!


thanks


Sexy, accent the curves!


The dress is adorable. I wear a size 14 so I ordered an XL. The dress is too small so I had to send it back.


This dress was amazing. Wore it to my bsby's baptism and got compliments from everyone! Material thick and made well. Looks way more expensive. I even linked a friend to the dress because she loved it so much.


I had bought this dress earlier in blue and love it so much that I bought it also in purple color. Stretchy material and compliments your curves.


The dress is ok. It fits, however, the quality of the dress is cheap.


This dress is amazing! I love it!
