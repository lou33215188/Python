Love this dress. 5f 3in weighing 140. I'm wearing size 8.


The medium was too snug, just returned so I can get a larger size, it's a pretty dress. Love the fabric


I am a size 10 and curvy.  This dress is perfect for a curvy/hour glass figure.  Material is a bit thin so good undergarments are a good investment for best results.


I love this dress! I read the reviews and sizing chart, and it fit as expected, and the material is great.  I will definitely be purchasing this brand more!


I love this dress. I'm 5'3" 195 lbs, size 14/16. I ordered a XXL. It hugged the curves as it should.


Wore this dress to a job interview and needless to say it did the trick.  Nice feeling material and it even has a side zipper.  It does not fit too tight but it does accentuate the curves of the body. The material is very nice and not thin at all.


Such a cute dress. 5'1" 145 lbs size medium. Flirty and feminine while being covered up.


I recommend this. Purchased for daughter and it fit as shown. Great color. Fast delivery.


Great material and beautiful colour. 5ft 4in and 160lbs large fits perfect


Such a gorgeous dress but not even close to true to size. If you are on the border order up. I wasn't even close to the border but I need a size up. Great length and ruffle.
