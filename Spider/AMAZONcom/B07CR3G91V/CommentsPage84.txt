Great dress! I got tons of compliments on it.


cute dress


The quality of this dress was excellent. I was pleasantly surprised.  I usually wear XS or 0. I bought the small which fit perfectly.


You will not go wrong with this dress! It’s very classy and hugs your curves. The material is thick and not cheap looking. Would buy again!!


Thank beautiful dress fits perfectly


Just received this dress and I love the way it fits. Would have rated with five stars but the zipper leaves a lot to be desired. I may have to replace it, otherwise it's a home rub.


This dress is garbage. Please don’t order. I’m very desapoit. I sended  an email about this product because is horrible, I waste my money. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THIS DRESS.


I wore this dress for my friend's Valentine luncheon.  I didn't realize I would be helping with finishing some of the menu items but this dress allowed me to bend, stoop, etc with no constraints. It was put to the test and passed.


Very disappointed.


Sizes run small.  I ordered a size medium and it fitted a little too close for comfort.  Will have to give it away.
