its lovely, i love this brand and have other dresses from them and usually the xxl fits a bit loose which is more work appropriate however this came and fit like the xl dresses i have. really cute tho and still fit just a bit sexier. i would recommend going a size up even if you have ordered Miusol before.


This is a lovely dress, great material. The only down side is the shoulders. As you can tell in the photos posted, for some of us the shoulders are atrocious. I took my dress to the tailor and it made a world of a difference. I docked a star simply because of the shoulders.


This is simply gorgeous. Nobody else buy it so I can be the only amazingly dressed woman at the parties! Seriously, it's very flattering.


Dress fits perfectly with such a good and thick material. Would recommend this dress to my friends, wore it to church and had some great comments about it.


Beautiful dress worth for money!


Cloth texture and quality is very good,just right size for me. I wore it on valentines day party and it was very eye catching! Love the dress!!


I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! I'm 5'3, 180 pounds, I didn't think I could pull off this dress but it is so flattering!!!


The fabric is wonderful & form fitting. I ordered the navy blue & the color is beautiful. Goes perfectly with my nude heels.


I will definitely be buying from here again!!!


An excellent looking dress


This is a nice dress.  I usually wear a medium but I ordered a large, Im 145lbs 5'10....... fits great especially for work......not too loose not too tight.  The material is of good quality.


Love it!! Fits exactly as expected. I have received so many compliments. The quality of the fabric is amazing...nice and reasonably weighted. It does not feel or look cheap at all. I am very pleased and will definitely order again.


Beautiful!
