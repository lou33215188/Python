I would love to give this dress five stars and the only reason I'm not is because while it's advertised as "purple" it is not purple at all, not even plum. The pictured dress looks purple on multiple screens, computer, phone and tablet but if you are shopping for a purple dress you'll be disappointed to receive a burgundy, maroon at best, colored dress. The fit is nice, hits at the knee for me, I'm 5'3 and 140 lb. I would recommend this dress based on style, but I do like the color burgundy/maroon. I would order this dress again in another color though. Hopefully that helps!


EXTREMELY SMALL


You can't find for this price this quality dress! Very happy!


This dress is a basic design that is well made. The fabric is comfortable for everyday wear. It fits perfectly. The color is great and the zipper on the side adds to the functionality of wearing it.


Although I ordered a size up after reading some of the reviews - the dress was still too small and clingy. Had to return it.


Perfect dress for.work!!!

You would have to a have the perfect hour glass figure to rock this dress.


I used there size chart. Ordered according to my measurements and there sizes. I must pay to get it altered.
