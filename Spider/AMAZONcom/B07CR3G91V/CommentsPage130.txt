What a lovely dress!! And it hugs all the right parts too!!!


I ordered this dress for an outing and i was very upset because the dress was tooo small. I ordered it a week in advance of my event and now I'm left to try and find something in less than 2days of my event. I wear a 2x I ordered a 3x to be sure it fit and i couldn't even zip it.  If your plussize stay away from this dress.


Too small. I don't fit into it


I just received the dress and the fit is perfect. The design is very slimming yet sexy. The length hit me right at the knee ( I'm 5'6) which is exactly what I wanted since I will be wearing to a work function. I will be ordering in other colors as well.


Didn't like the ruffle on me


Great fabric and fit


Fits perfectly ğŸ¤—, I'ma start wearing dresses More often.


The dress's fabric was quality, but this runs exceptionally small -I usually can fit a small, but not with this


Love the fabric!


Love
