Love this dress! Figure flattering. I'm a US 12 and the 2X fit just right!


I re-ordered a larger size and it was still too small. This dress is made for a small child.


love this dress! Perfect fit,Ii am 5'3", with larger breasts and a large booty, this fits great!


The product is exactly as shown in the picture but a bit longer for me. I got a size S and I am 5'3" and it came 2 inches below my knees which I didnt expected.


Very nice dress. Ran a little too small though. If you are curvy and have a back side, get a size up. I am usually a 4/5 but the small is a tad tight.


Gorgeous dress  fits just like how the photo looks


Very cute!  Ordered a small.  Fits very well except my waist which is not uncommon.  Decent material, great length, nice cut!


Beautiful dress  and quality material, but runs small.  I should've ordered a larger size.


It looks great on especially with the right accessories. You can dress it up and it can be worn to work as well.


It is a beautiful dress!!! I just wish it was more fitted!! I'm a true size 2 and it was too loose in my waist area!! I wish the cut on the cleavage was a bit lower too!!! Is like a not so well made princess cut!!! It kind of hides your cleavage instead of enhance it!! Material is good!! If you are a little over weight it will look good on you!
