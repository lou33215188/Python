Purchased this Dress for an upcoming Fashion Show and I was very pleased that it fit like it does. Absolutely fabulous and for such an affordable price. Makes my butt look GREAT...


Loved this dress! Fit perfectly and made me look curvy! The material isn't fancy but it can be dressed up with the right accessories and it doesn't wrinkle easy and it's stretchy


Great dress fit very nicely. Will be making other purchases


Great dress, I ordered an XLarge (size 14/16) and it fit, just a little tooo snug for me.  BUT , I ordered the XXLarge and am sure that it will fit just fine.


excellent service and product


Classy. Fit was bang on. Arrived on time. good quality material and length was perfect.


Fits perfectly, slim on waist, just the way I like. Perfect for all types of body shapes.


Beautiful dress, it shows all of your curves!


I am 5'4, 190lbs, size 14 and the XXL fit good. Great little dress for work since it is fitted but fall at knees so it's not too revealing.


I love this dress, I am 152 pounds and I purchased a medium and it fits perfectly and it even had some room, it wasn't tight. I wasn't expecting the material to be this thick either.
