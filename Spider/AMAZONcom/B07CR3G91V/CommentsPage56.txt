I’m 5’5 and 135lbs, I ordered a medium and the fit was great. The material had some stretch in it and it looks like jersey but doesn’t look cheap. It was well made. It went down below my knees. I am pleased with the dress.


This is a great dress! I usually wear a size 4 so I ordered a small, and it's just a tad tight but still comfortable. The material is quality material--I still can't believe I paid only $20 for this dress. I will be wearing this for my graduation from med school. Its conservative but still sexy.


Nice, the ruffle is a little odd, but it is a nice drss


length not accurate I am 5'4 and it did not reach my knees


I ordered a medium. I wear a 10 in bottoms and large for tops. The medium didn't fit I should of ordered a exta large. I sent it back Yesterday.


Nice material not stretchy.


bought it for my daughter ... and it looks great on her --- well worth the money and then some


Fits ok. Now wowed. Still trying to decide if I will keep this dress. I really like the color but not sure about the fit around my stomach


Yes yes and yes


I'm 5' 1" wt 119 36 29 37 and med fit perfect. Wash cool water and hung to dry no ironing necessary


Cute dress but after washing it did not fit!!  Never got a chance to wear it!
