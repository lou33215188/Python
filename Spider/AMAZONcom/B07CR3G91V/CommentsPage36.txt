Such a lovely and classy dress! The material is a good quality. I wore it to my godsons christening and received many compliments. I would definitely recommend. I am 5 feet, 118 pounds and purchased a size small.


Really nice office or church dress. It is fitted enough that it looks very feminine but not so much that it's inappropriate for work. I am 5'0 114 lbs and ordered a small. I would say it is true to size. The only draw back is that the fabric is a bit too thick which can make it a little hot.


Beautiful dress. Great quality. Versatile! I recommend buying a size larger than usual because the dress is very form fitting, but a size up gives room for comfort. LOVE this dress!!!


love love love, fits perfectly. Wore it at a wedding last month and love it. Made me feel like i did before my baby. Thank you


Loved this dress.  You can dress it up or down.  I wore this for a wedding and it was perfect.


Item well made compared to most others. Fits well, depending on selecting proper


comparable sizing. Quality of material,  issue with the side ruffle somewhat lopsided


would have given 5 stars. Regret must return item.


Love it! Perfect for curvy ladies, I ended up sewing a little bit of the back slit but only because I'm super paranoid. Love the tummy rouching it finds the belly.


the dress fitted nicely but the ruching on the side was messy and did not sit well.


I love this dress! I have a white coat ceremony approaching and needed a professional dress for it and this one is perfect. I am 5' 6" 36C about 145 lb and I have an athletic build and a medium fits me very well. It's a little snug around my hips but that's due to my squat-licious booty. Highly recommend!


followed other reviews, im a 14 - 16 and it fit nicely.  good quality
