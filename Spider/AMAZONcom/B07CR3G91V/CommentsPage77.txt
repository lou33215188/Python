Beautiful, but runs small!!


Beautiful! It is a classy dress for work and the size and material are very good. Just as expected.


Beautiful dress, very great price!!!


It’s a bit snug. Or fit exactly to your body with no extra room so consider when selecting a size.


Love it!


Stretchy cotton-like material, not what expected but I’ll Find a use for it.


nice fit


The design is nice, fabric is ok, but it doesn't fit so well at the top draped area, way too large.


Beautiful dress. I have got lots of compliments all week. Love the color too. fast shipping will order from this company again.
