OK


The wife loves it


I tried to return the dresses because it did not fit right or looked right on multiple body types.


Love the fit and color!


I read in other reviews that the ruching is weird, but I bought it anyway. Should have listened. I'll be sending it back. It just lays funny and it's not flattering


fabric is soft


Lovely dress! Highlights curves! Not clingy and material is thick.


Nice dress but fits slightly too large.


Great dress, received many compliments. Awesome buy for the money. Would def purchase again.
