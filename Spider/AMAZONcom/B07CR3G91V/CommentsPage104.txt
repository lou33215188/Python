The dress is perfect..love it


I got a wrong dress. Did not look like the one on the picture and the label was cut off.


I like it


Love it! I'm 5'6", 140 lbs and wear a 34D - medium fit perfectly!


Beautiful dress. Fits perfectly. I'm definitely going to order this dress in another color. Absolutely LOVE it!!!


The dress itself is cute but too small. The real problem is that it came later than expected. I didn't get to where it for the function intended.


Shape and quality of the material great. It will require Spanx underneath.


This dress was perfect!!! It looks great and the material is comfortable!


Love my little red dress. Fits really good!


Nice  style of dress. But  didn't like the material
