Granted this was a cheaper price for a dress. I'm typically a 2 in women's dress size as I'm 5' 110lbs. (pretty petite). I knew that an XS wasn't available and that S was the smallest size available, but I was able to take it in places that needed it. If you are not busty in the chest, I would not recommend this dress. I'm an A cup and it didn't seem as though I filled out the top part of the dress very well. The fabric around the stomach was a bit odd too. Of course it looks great on the model in the picture, but I had to also work some sewing magic on that part too. Fit great in the hips and great length. Overall not a bad dress, but if you are petite like me, I would not necessarily recommend.


Love it! I needed a dress like this for a semi formal Bday party. I was scared that the dress will look cheap (Material) but it was made great for the price. I'm 5'1 so I thought that it might be too long since I'm so short but it's not. I weigh 144 and read in the description that the dress is 5% spandex so I'm like yessss I can go down to a size small even though I wear a medium, I like my dress tight and right lol. Here's a photo! I will be purchasing in more colors!


Spoke at a sexual assault conference, chose red to make a statement,  POWER!!! It is a beautiful dress that accentuates every curve. On behalf of other "curvies", this dress shows all: wear spanx if you're built like me.  I purchased an XL due to my penchant for roundness below my waist.


Received tons of compliments and will order other colors.


I love love this dressğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�. I got plenty of compliments of how flattering the dress looks on me. So am 5 feet 8 inches, 183lbs, my bust is 40 waist is 36, hips is 41and my regular dress is size 12.


 I don't believe it is really true to size because I order a size 14 base on the other reviews and am glad I did. It fits perfectly and I was able to move in it freely. If I had purchase the 12 it would have fitted like a glove and probably be a little too tight to walk and move around. The bust fits perfectly so again if I had chosen the 12 it would have been too tight around bust.


In addition the material is very nice. I thought it was those loose/ flimsy/ spandex material but it is not. The material is a nice soft cotton which is kind of heavy not thin. Again I love itğŸ˜�


Also when the dress first came I was a bit worried about the drape at the front it seemed a little big but after ironing the dress, it laid nicely on my body. I hope this review will be helpful to someone.


P.s order 1 size up if you want to move comfortable if not your true size will definitely fit like a glove.


I like this dress, it is really pretty in person. Because I am pear shaped, I have to order the dress to fit my hips and have to have the top tailored (but this is with 99% of clothes I purchase so no biggie). I wasn't sure about the top V-Neck because I want to wear this for work, but it is sewn so that it doesn't go down too low. All in all a great dress and nice for the office--or even a business/casual evening out.


Note: Order according to the size chart. I am usually a medium or 8-10 in dresses and usually order a 12 online, this one, I ordered two sizes up for the hip measurement on this dress. One size up would have fit but two sizes up was looser in the hip area which I like--either way the top would have been a little too large for me and needed adjustment but I'm happy I went two sizes up. For Reference my measurements are about 36, 29 (or 30),43.5


This is my 3 dress I have purchased off Amazon and made by Miusol. The price is so amazing for the quality of dress. I am a person who hates shopping and even more so going to try on clothes in fitting rooms. I love how fast the dress arrives and how well it fits. I always get asked where I bought my dress and friends always ask to borrow them. Love my dress. Will definitely be buying more


Awkward ruching. I am a size 8 (borderline 6) I ordered the size Large and it was too big. While the medium fit well, I thought the ruching was very awkward. It's the design of the dress, not the fit. If I ordered a size down, the dress would've been too small.


I bought this dress hoping to wear it to job interviews, however it did not look as expected. The dress was wonderful and fit me perfectly except it made me look as though I was 6 months pregnant when in reality, I just carry all my weight in my midsection. I ended up returning this dress because it did not flatter me but I still gave it 4 stars because of the quality of the dress. I was incredibly impressed as the fabric was thick and well made. I wish I could have kept this but unfortunately my body type did not agree with the make of the dress! I would recommend this dress for purchase but be careful if you're like me and carry mid section weight!


Bought the navy blue in medium with the little frill sleeves. Am 5.3 136 lbs. Waist 28 bust 34c. Hips 35 or 36 inch. Thick legs! Big bones! Normally wear a 6 fitting me in US sizes. The materail was thickish. So no slip needed. Color was as expected, without the sheen in pics. Bust area was just right, waist slightly loose, stomach area ruches need tightening a bit because of size M. Length covering knee just about. Whole look was curvy. Can wear day to night with a change of jackets on top. Could have done with a small but would have been a little snug at bust.


Added pics but wasnt wearing a smoothing undergarment and only string bikini panties. And bra. Just wanted to get review out there after tryinig


I am 5'3, 150lbs, wear a size 10 normally and carry my weight in my hips and thighs. I ordered the large and it fits great. It is tight, but stretchy, exactly what I was looking for to show off my curves. The only thing that I have an issue with is the cap sleeves shown on the picture are considerably more fitted than what I got on my dress ordered. They are much larger and poof up & out.  I ordered this dress for graduation, I am going to see about maybe pinning or taping the sleeves down a bit so I don't appear like I'm preparing for takeoff.  Other than the sleeves, I am happy with it. The material is thick, appears well made, and isn't see through.  Also, with being on the shorter side, I was worried about the dress being too long, that isn't the case. It lands right below the knee. I purchased the v-neck version without the ruffle additions.
