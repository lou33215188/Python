Love the fit and is beautiful


Great fit. It breaths and snugs very well to a curvy body. My wife want's to order more colors.


Simply gorgeous. It adds dimensions to my figure. I just love it.


Good material and looks great. Love this dress. ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


The dress is beautiful. I purchased a medium. I'm 5'3' 139lb. A great buy and price.


Love th dress! Fit exactly as expected.


Lovely dress, but too small. Country of manufacture may have something to do with the sizing (even though I did consult the chart before ordering.


Small was a little too big!


Really nice neckline. Iâ€™m glad I got the medium. Iâ€™m a size 6-8ish. 5â€™2 125lb


I am 5'3", 150lbs, and 34 DD. I generally wear an 8/10 and bought this in a large. I really liked the color and fit, it hit exactly like in the picture. The dress was a little high on my chest and you could tell it was pinned/sewn together which I didn't like. The fabric is thick, but has some stretch. On me, the darts at the waist looked like odd pockets which is why I took 1 star off-- it just looked odd on me. I think this is a great dress for church or work.
