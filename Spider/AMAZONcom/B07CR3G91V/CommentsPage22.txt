Beautiful dress but the zipper wouldn’t unzip so I had to slip it over my head. Even after that was done the dress fit fine everywhere but the stomach part was baggy/maternity looking.


Overall good product. I could have went down a size but it doesn’t stretch much so I am good with it. I would purchase again in a different color!


I love this dress. It is very classy, I received lots of compliments. The fabric is stretchy, so it’s very comfortable if you need to climb stairs or if you need to keep moving around. So far this has become one of the favorite dresses in my wardrobe and it makes me feel great that I got this for an excellent price.


The dress looks like a uniform more than a party dress. The color is a deep blue but the zipper can be tricky. The pleads in the front of the dress are not very flattering so you need a tummy control under garments. The v along the collar line was not very noticeable. I wore the dress once and that was it for the price.


Gorgeous, rich fabric and color.  Perfect fit.  Feminine and sexy.


Good idea for the dress. it was difficult to choose the right measurement, so I ordered larger size and fixed it in the waist line.


Amazing. Great fit. I was scared to buy it from amazon but it is so worth it. Thick material and beautiful! I am 5'6 and 215lb and I order 2x. A bit lose on the waist but still looked good.


Such a beautiful dress! Bought it for a holiday party, fit me well, and it was perfect for the occasion . I am 5'6" , 120 lb and size S fits well. The fabric is so comfortable, the style chic. Looking forward to wear at other occasions.


The cap sleeves stuck out like wings on my arms.  The V cut didn't appear as is in the pic. The material and length were good.  Returned item.


It fits nicely and material is nice too. But somehow a little area in front of tummy keeps popping up and I have to keep pressing it to stay down.
