This dress looks and feels beautiful! Size was perfect!


Very cute dress


I love this dress but it fitted very small in the hips, so I reordered the dress in a larger size


Love the dress. I usually wear a large but perhaps I should have gotten an extra large.


excellent product


The zipper broke the day I was suppose to wear it
