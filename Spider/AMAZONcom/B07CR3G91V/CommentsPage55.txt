I do wish they had the dress in Extra Small. I am 5'1" and I weigh 110. There's not a lot going on in the top area so I was wanting it to hug me a tad bit tighter. But all in all a really cute dress! I'd buy again. Wore it to a business meeting.


Pretty dress I really love â�¤ï¸� it ğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ


I fits perfect.  145  5â€™7. DDD. Small hips.  Order a small.  It doesnâ€™t look cheap


I returned it. I asked for a medium. I'm a short but fatty person. So, widht was perfect, but it was too long (I am about 4,9 f. and 63 kg). Fabric was ok, i thought it was going to be warm but it's a little tick so you can use it for spring days.


I get so many compliments on this dress. I love it!


Love this dress. I usually wear XL on dresses and I order a XXL it fit good. The material is really good and comfortable. I wore it to a convention and I tent to look for comfortable clothing because we are there for hours and I honestly still wanted to wear the dress the next day.


I super love the dress it is so gorgeous... it fits perfect on me... I love it...


Very sexy and nice.


Very nice on


It's a beautiful dress and the fabric is very nice.  It is small but I am not sending it back. I now have an incentive, I will wear this dress.
