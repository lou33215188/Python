I absolutely loved this dress. The price was insane and I received it the next day. I loved the fit and length!!


If you have any doubt , I can tell you: buy it!!!Material,color,design and paking are awesome!! It got earlier than expected!! Definitely buying again from Miusol!!!Also perfect for gifts!!


The XXL was too small, I am hippy could not get i tover  my hips, returned it today. It is a very pretty dress


cute but way small for what the size should be. I could not even get it on.


I ordered purple and the dress is a maroon color. Some of the stitching is loose and showing however, it is comfortable and fits well.


Fits great!! Great material that’s flexible yet strong. Won’t loose shape! Perfect


Love this dress!!!! Navy blue fits perfect


I wanted to love this dress but the front is vey weird and sits like extra skin from a surgery gone wrong! It almost seems like it would be perfect for someone who is pregnant.


If i could wear this dress everyday. I would.


Bought this for my girlfriend as a gift . She loved the outfit and it it fit well. Nice stylish outfit
