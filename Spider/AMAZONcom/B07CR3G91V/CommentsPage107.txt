I like the way it fit and I am keeping it.


This dress is absolutely gorgeous! I wear a size 6, so I took others advice and went up a size. I am pleased with my purchase.


Love it!


Super clingy.


I love the fit and the color, it's a great buy


AWFUL. Got a large because everyone reviewed it runs true to size. IT DOES NOT RUN TRUE TO SIZE. A large is literally a size 2. Awful


I wish the sleeve where a bit longer, everything else is great


This dress is amazing. It hugged my curves well and was very flattering.


Great style and color


Cute dress
