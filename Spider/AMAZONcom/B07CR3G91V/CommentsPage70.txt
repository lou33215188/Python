The dress was beautiful. I wore it for an interview and I think it went pretty well.


Do not like at all. Color was not that rich sort of emerald green it seemed online. Cheaply made.


LOVE THE COLOR AND FIT


Great dress. Fits perfect. Did purchase again the in the dress


Pretty but cannot wear. May return it or give as a gift.


Somewhat shorter than the picture tad bit snug but super cute.


Great buy for the price!!


Perfect for work!


Was a little worried this dress might be cheap looking but quality is actually very good. Style is super cute and fits me very well. I wear for work and have gotten complimented!
