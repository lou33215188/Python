Really cute dress! Was perfect for a formal event and will be perfect holidays party! Ordered a medium size. I'm 5'4, 130 pounds and athletic shape (a little long for me but actually stylish when wearing heels)


Got my dress today! The dress fits perfectly. I ordered a size up. Nice fabric. Great for the price,


Too small but nice material.


This dress is very beautiful and fits well. I'm so happy with this purchase.


I am usually a xL to xxL but xxL based on the reviews I ordered xxL  I am happy I did the dress fits perfect. The quality on this dress is amazing not too thin not too thick  and the style is more visual on a more curvy body. I will buy more from this sell dresses are beautiful.


This is a nice dress and it fits good. I got a large I'm 5'6' 177 pounds.


In love


A little snug but that's ok - motivates me to loose a little weight!
