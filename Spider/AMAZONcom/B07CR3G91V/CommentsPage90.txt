Great quality and fits perfect.


Excellent dress.. Nice fabric cannot beat the price. Wearing it to a wedding next week.. Bought other dresses much more expensive they don't compete. Happy with purchase


Beautiful dress in person. The fabric and construction are top notch.


I think my daughter is sending this back.  Did not like it.


Great for the price. The cap sleeves are a bit loose for my taste but they are fine. I normally wear a size 10 and I ordered an extra large. It fits fine.


This dress I have purchased in black and blue. I love the fit and the material is a nice quality.


Extremely pleased with the way it fits. I bought the large and it fitted me perfectly!


Have not worn it yet but I do expect rave review s when I do! Lol


Love the dress fits me perfect...


I love them


This dress is beautiful and fits perfectly! Awesome buy!
