Nice dress. A little more conservative than I was expecting, but flattering.


Love the way this hides my stomach. The rouching is great and the red is popping!


This dress is so cute. It fits true to size and the material is nice - plenty thick so as not to be see-through. It's a great length for work.


Wasn't really too large, but it fit awkwardly.


Very curve hugging and pretty.


Wore this dress to work, the fit perfect, color was just as the pic


Would highly recommend.


Beautiful dress!  Great quality and detail. Fit as expected. Planning to order in more colors. Very flattering fit.


The dress rides up a little in the middle . But it's still a pretty dress .


I love this dress so much I ordered the red and navy. the material is great and the length is perfect for me. My husband said I looked sexy and elegant in it paired with same color pumps, I got another WOW!
