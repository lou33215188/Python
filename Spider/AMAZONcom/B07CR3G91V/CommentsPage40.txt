I love the fit. I'm 5'4 188lbs and got a size XL. It looks wonderful.


Perfect! Love it! Fit very well. I'm about 5'9" 145 lbs.


My measurements are 44, 37, 45 and I'm 5'2". I bought the 2x. Beautiful dress. Quality fabric. Good length as I'm short lol. A tiny bit too fitted for work but i'm running so it won't be a problem for long. Very happy with my purchase.


dress fits well..second one..the mid section is a little big but the runching helps.


small is on the big side for me..I wished it came in extra small..I would buy all colors if it did.


This dress fit perfectly! BUT, the ruffle is way bigger than the picture shows! Like, way too big for my liking!


Nice dress,superb quality.


Too large and it's not even the dress I ordered smh cheap material


I have received plenty of compliments with this dress, it is much sturdier and better quality than I though.


This is a great dress! It fits really well, very flattering. My sisters tried it on as well and it looked great on them. The material is thick so it holds your shape to a nice hourglass. Really loved it.


Excellent
