Fabric feels and looks of good quality but it came with a little hole on one side


awesome dress, perfect for an all purpose dress.


Very good


Excelente


I love this dress. I was skeptical at first but wow it fits perfectly! Great material.


Ordered this for a wedding and it was perfect. I". 5'5 36D and about 152 lbs. I ordered a medium and it fit like a dream.


Very happy with the product is very good quality and my wife is very satisfied, is a little tight to her waist


If your going to court like me, it'd probably be best to get a medium but the fit really accentuates your curves and does a great job hiding the problem areas! I'm 5'3 36/C bust 140 lbs. Love this dress!


Good


Got tons of compliments, love this dress!
