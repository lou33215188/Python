Love love love this dress. It is so flattering and hugs all the right places.


very nice - the top drip part is a bit long but overall super nice dress.


Ordered a large and love the fit.  Wearing it to Vegas for birthday.  Ordered white but exchange for black.


Made me look like a HIPPO.  Would probably look great on someone tall and thin.  Dress was not for me.


I am 5'9" and size 12. A Large fit perfectly. Very comfortable and not see through at all (ordered green). Love it! Now I want the other colors.


nice dress, if you like your dress fit order a size smaller.


I like it but to the rushing on the side of the skirt.  This olive color can handle the polyester fabric ok


Very pleased with the fit and look of this dress.  It was perfect to wear to the outdoor wedding that I purchased it for.


Normally I buy clothes a size up when buying online but i am so glad I read everyone's reviews and bought my normal size. I absolutely love this dress. It fits amazing and looks great. I am a plus sized woman and I especially love the over hang from the top it helps hide the parts of your stomach most women do like to show off.


Very comfortable and versatile :-)
