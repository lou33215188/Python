Love love love this dress. Shows what I want to show,  hides what I want to hide!


LOVE THIS DRESS!!! I feel so sexy when I dress up in this! LOVE IT!


Very pretty fit. Fits as expected. Nice quality material. I am 5'6", 170lbs and curvy. Fits great with a good stretch.


Love this dress! Very versatile as you can wear it off the shoulder, one shoulder, both shoulders covered. I am almost 5’10 and it’s long enough to be short but not too short. Since it is ruched you can adjust to desired length.


Love it, perfect fit


LOVE iT!


Wore this for a Birthday celebration- sexy but classy


Just fit to your body but it is cute though.


Beautiful, and nice quality. AMAZING stretch. I am 5'9,  150lbs 36DDD it fit well , it was a little short for my liking, but definitely a nice dress


Absolutely loved the dress made me feel great!
