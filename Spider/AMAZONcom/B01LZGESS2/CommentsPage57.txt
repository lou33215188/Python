great


Not expensive looking but cute enough for a night of dancing!


This dress is perfect and so comfortable!! I bought in purple too and love it!!


Great gift, made my mom feel good the way it fit and felt. She loved it, usually the  cloths looks great on the model. Well it looked just as good on my mom.


Love the dress!  Just order a size up.


It's cheaply made...I wouldn't buy it again


It's just ok. Not amazing or great and probably should be cheaper


satisfied


Love It!


Wore it on a Hawaiian Cruise to the Captain's Dinner!  People said, "Ooh, La, La!  The Lady in Red!"
