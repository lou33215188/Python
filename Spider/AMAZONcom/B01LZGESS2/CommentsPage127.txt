nice


Looks horrible on


I like it!


I ordered a red large and got a green medium


Really cute. I am glad I went the size down.


Very happy with this dress.


It's a little stretch in the dress but the dress is tight.  I did think the bottom of the dress was a straight bottom.


I had many compliments on the dress and it was soooo comfortable!  I was worried it would look cheap and baggy...buying online is always so hit and miss for me...but it ended up being one of my favorites that I wore on our vacation to Mexico.  It's much more sexy and flattering than it looks.  But in a tasteful way.  I wore some fun tan wedges and a long tassel necklace with it to dress it up, but it could easily be worn as a fun and flirty casual dress.  I'm about 5' 8.5" and 139 pounds and ordered a medium.  I probably could have fit a small..it's very stretchy, but I am happy with the medium..gives me some room to grow :)


The color was exactly what I wanted.Thanks


Loved it!!
