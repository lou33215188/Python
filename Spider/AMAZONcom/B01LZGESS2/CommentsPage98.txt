It's pretty but the fabric is not good quality. I may need to return.


Super cute casual summer outfit!


It looks great on me.  I would highly recommend for those hard to find clothes type body.


This is a great fit, even in the larger sizes the draping effect is still long enough to cover little buldges but the fit skirt at the bottom makes it very flattering.  Totally worth it!


Amazing i could have went a size down i got an xl im 5'3 and 180lbs I love it


Love it! It fits just right XL


Great dress, love the versatility


Loved the dress and the comfortable stretchy fabric.  Not too short and not too long.  Hid my worst spots and accentuated my best spots.


Looks fabulous and is so comfy! Helps if a tummy shaper is worn.


Nice dress, it was nicer than expected. Excellent price for quality
