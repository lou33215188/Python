Great little black dress. Very sexy but not over the top.


Cute dress!  I am ordering the white also.


I love the way it looks and feels worth the money spent I brought a red and white one as well .


Love the dress but a little tighter then I like on the bottom. Good quality looks nice.


Great Fit!


Great dress. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the fabric is stiffer than I expected and the drape isn't as light and flow-y as I had thought. Fits great and hides a LOT of stuff...!!!


Love it do much bought it again.


looks great.


I LOOOOOOVEEEEE THIS DRESS!


Like honestly this is the best dress I've ever had. it fits pretty nice, it looks sexy, you can use it different ways and it's casual.


I'm 5'5ft and weight 175 pounds, I bought it large and it fit as expected, I think I could have even purchased medium size but it would have been too short. If you are thinking about getting these dress or not. BUY IT! you won't regret.


Tried it on havenâ€™t wore it yet saving it for the islands but i hides my gut and is really sexy
