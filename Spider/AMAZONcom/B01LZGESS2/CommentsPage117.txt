Love the dress. I received so many compliments.


This dress arrived and it is NOT the same blue.


Cheap material, do not waste your money please


This dress is the PERFECT dress for traveling. It can even double as a shirt if you tuck it in. Perfect to be able to use it for two looks while traveling makes packing light a dream. VERY flatttering if you have a bit of a belly as I do.


I love this dress!


Cute and made well


All that it was supposed to be.


The dress is true to size and the fabric flows well and is not clingy. It is really a cute dress and the purple is very deep.


Fit better than expected.


Arrived quickly.


Not sheer!


I love my dress!


Love it. Fit well and the sizing was accurate.
