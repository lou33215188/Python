Super CUTE & SEXY!


Lots of compliments on this dress.  Comfortable to wear and fun too!


Perfect!! 5'11, 192lbs, with a mama pouch, it looks great on me! Sexy not slutty!


I love the dress. I have it in white... I ordered it in black 2 days ago,  When I received it, it reaked of cigarette smoke. Disgusting!!


unfortunately it did not fit how I wanted & have to return it.


Love this dress.. It fit perfectly and hides my gut and not thin at all.. I'm 5'6 and 180lbs and a Large fit perfectly


Itâ€™s cheaply made and the stitching is already coming out and I have not even wore it yet


The design but very cheap material, should be better quality for more cost.


Fits nice, it runs big


Great dress for the price!  Very comfortable and covered the right places while still looking sexy!
