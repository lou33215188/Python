I love the way this dress fits! I got the white for my All White Party in Mexico and I can't wait to wear it!!!


Love it


The top part of it was longer and wider than expected.


Great party dress! It hugs your curves and hides the rest.


I really love the way this dress fits. The material is a bit cheap, but it looks good when worn. I plan to dress it up with nicer accessories.


Gorgeous dress. The red for a a full size smaller than the black version though


True fit. Gorgeous dress.


I felt that the top was a bit long.  However, the dress is good-looking.  I like it best over one shoulder.


Love it


So cute
