As the other reviews have mentioned, this fits mostly true to size, if not just a bit large. Form fitting, but very very stretchy.


Love this!!  Super cute!


very pretty- great for alll year...can be dressed up or down.  Good for travel


I had read the reviews answer saw this dress ran large, so I ordered down a size. Fun dress for resort wear! I also ordered it in red for Valentines Day. I wore then one shoulder bare.


This dress is amazing fits right, perfect length and can be worn in different styles. It accentuates parts of my body that I love and hides the parts I don't love as much...lol


Thanks for a great dress


Cute I didn't like the style for me but I'm sure its adorable on others. I'm 5 3 135lbs I think I needed a small and I ordered a medium.


Fits great!  My only minus is that the material is slightly see through in the one layer areas (the bottom of the dress) so a slip is necessary,


returning  see thru, thin fabric on the butt and legs area


Fit tragically. Return.


I love this dress so much I bought it in two colors. I recently wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments! I love the fact that you can wear it so many different ways (over both shoulders, asymmetrical, off the shoulder, etc...). It fit exactly as expected.
