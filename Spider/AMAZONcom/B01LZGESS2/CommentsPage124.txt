Great .... love the fabric ..... great travel dress and works for any occasion.


I normally take a large. This was too big its still cute so ill keep it but i could have bought a medium


It fits amazingly!!!


Perfect


Very cute and comfy dress


I still like it.  The fabric is very nice.  The top is just a little too loose at the band.  I will fix from home.


It fits perfect, just the way the picture shows it..
