I read others reviews and felt like they were all pretty good and consistent. I bought a large - I'm short and curvy - it was perfect! Fit just right


Bought this for my daughter. She is a size 2 I bought the small and it fit perfectly. She loves it


Love love love it!!


This dress fit perfectly and I loved that it was able to be worn more then one way!!


The picture is very deceiving and the dress is cheaply made with poor quality fabric


Love it!  Super comfy and I can wear it without a bra and I have DDDâ€™s


I really liked my dress! Plan on ordering another one in another color soon!


Beautiful dress. Looking forward to wearing it on date night soon.


I was hesitant on if i should get a 1 or 2x. I bought the 1x and it fits perfect. Not too short. I love it.


cheaply made
