Former fitting but cute and a good dress for the price


I love it can't wait to take my engagement pictures in this dress


I got many compliments. The dress fits well


Omg I loved it and so did everyone else!!!!


Amazing color and fantastic fabric. I never felt as if I couldnâ€™t move


Looked so great on, very flattering.


Fits fine. The top part was too long and not flattering on me, returned it.


This dress was very thin.


I love the dress. One drawback though, I wore it on my shoulder but it kept riding up.


Fabric was not as expected which made it look cheap
