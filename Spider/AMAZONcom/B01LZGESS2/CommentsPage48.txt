This dress hides the tummy away and makes the bum look goooood.


This is a beautiful party dress, it helps hide my baby bump.


This is a really cute dress.  I purchased a medium and it fit fine. I wore it off the shoulder and without a bra and it looked fabulous.  Lots of compliments on the dress so I also bought it in red.


I don't generally like dresses however this dress is amazingly soft and and very comfortable.


Dress arrived today. Tried it on and the small size is perfect for me - I am 5'1" 120 lbs. Very flattering! I'm hoping it won't be too much work to get the wrinkles out, but other than I am very happy with this purchase.


Love this dress, super cute and I feel sexy in it. Thinking of buying a second one in a different color. If you are debating on buying it, trust me, you will love it.


Super large and very stretchy. Not flattering. Had to return


Super cute. Received many compliments.


I’ve gained some weight over the holidays and it’s now my birthday so I was looking for something flattering. I’m a size 12/14 on bottoms but the top was a little loose on me because I’m much smaller up top. I ordered a medium. It’s a good pick.


This dress was just what I needed for my girls trip to Vegas, very comfortable and looked good, I found a pair of pumps that matched perfect...
