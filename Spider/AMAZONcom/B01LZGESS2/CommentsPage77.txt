Cutest dress!! You can't go wrong.  Received several compliments.


Cute but cheaply made. It's fine for a darker club. I end up returning it.


Awesome dress!  Great price a decent quality


I absolutely LOVEEEEE it!!!


This is not a good quality dress. The dress came with a spot on it, I'm guessing it's old and used may be. Overall I didn't like the quality of it. I do not recommend this dress. The style and fit is very nice, if only the quality was little better.


I like this a lot.  It fits great and is comfortable.


I love this dress! Very comfortable and hides my problem areas.


Was very thin and looked cheap.


It's not as pretty as I expected from all the rave reviews it was given. Maybe I'm just used to a higher quality and more form-fitting dress for a special occassion dress.


Material was nice. But way too big.  Read reviews and ordered a size x-large in pink and black. Will have to return.
