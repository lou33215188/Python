Sexy dress. Covers little belly issues. Very flattering.


Gorgeous dress!!! Wore it the day it arrived and got massive compliments!!!!!


Love it but I'd order one size larger than the size you wear.


Wife love it


Love love this dress!!!


Great dress, wound up returning because I did not need it.


The fit was totally off. I’m 5’6 and 118 lbs. I ordered a size small and was practically swimming in it. The material is cheap and poorly sewn. Looked sloppy and frumpy. Went straight to the “donation bin”.


This is a really nice dress and is great if you are trying to hide any imperfections in the tummy region.


Bought this dress for my daughter's homecoming dance. It fit perfectly, she looked beautiful and received so many compliments.


Very nice.
