Material is decent and i ordered off of recommendations of others for sizing and it fit just fine.


Loved this dress! Read the reviews and it was right on. Hid the tummy area as well. Will be ordering in another color!


Fits great and very cute.  But it does need a slip.


You love it I order a red one love the way  it fit

Perfect fit ,love how it conceals the tummy
