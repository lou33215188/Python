I just got my dress in today! I absolutely love it! The fit is perfect! You can adjust the dress to make it shorter or longer. It doesn't ride up on your shoulders like some off shoulders do! I definitely want it in ever color!! This was my first clothing purchase off Amazon, and I'm completely satisfied!


Can't wait to wear this...I was pleasantly sureprised I will update with pics after I wear it to a concert on Monday. It's super flattering are a fuller figure and hides the belly which is just what I needed.


Makes a curvy girl look and feel fabulous!


This dress has great stretch. I actually could have ordered a small. I'm wearing a medium. The length of this actually reached my knees but I just cinchd it up. Like I said, it has great stretch.


I'm 5'3 120 lbs


It was so comfortable i got a lot of compliments im ordering more colors


Absolutely great looking dress. Good for regular days out and can also be dressed up for night out. Went back and bought another in a different color.


The dress is nice. I am 5'1 and 155 lbs not curvy at all, and I ordered a large. The ruffles on the dress is really long. All in all I am pleased with the dress. Definitely could have gotten away with a medium.


The dress fit everything and hid what I needed. I'm 5"4 and 220 lbs. As you can see it look great. The versatility of the wear is great too


I purchased a Medium. I’m 5’2, 160 lbs and it fit perfect! It is a tad bit See through but not too much of an issue!


I bought this to wear at a bday celebration. Im 4'11, 130ishh and the small fit perfectly. I also love the versitility of the top and the many ways you can wear it. The design flap helps to hide my tummy bulge...perfect!
