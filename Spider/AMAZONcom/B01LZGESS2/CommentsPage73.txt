wrong dress


got this dress for my wife she was very excited to receive the dress but once she opened the box. it was not the dress I order which made her very upset.  the Dress was ugly and looked like some one switched it out it had makeup on the neckline.


love this dress will be buying other colors


Bought it for my wife and both her and I love it ;)


The material is thin and show too much of your flaws and it's not as cute and sexy as the picture


Beautiful dress, size descriptions are pretty accurate! Just ordered a different color because of how beautiful it looks!!


Fits nicely! Great dress!


It's fit me just right


This by far is one of my favs....It hides the Pudge... its form fitting....Plus I'm top heavy and it made my breast not look so large
