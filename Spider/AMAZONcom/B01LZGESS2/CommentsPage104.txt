Loved it so much I purchased 3 in total.  Very Sexy. You can wear it casual with flat sandals or dress it up with high heels.


looks very nice but material does look cheap up close


I like how this allows you to feel like you are wearing a trendy dress but also gives some cover up to areas you don't want to have accentuated.


Looked horrible once you put it on. Looked like a white potato sack with ruffle.


I love it. I don't wear a lot of dresses because most dresses doesn't fit me right. But this dress is perfect.


I love the stretchy material, it makes for a comfortable fit.It also works to cover a bloated tummy as well. Great buy!


Cute black dress that can be worn in a number of ways.  Not too big a fan of the fabric, but decent value.


dont like the look in person may just be the material but I am sending it back.


I liked that you can change it up how you want to wear it. Form fitting towards the bottom but comfortably.


Beautiful dress! Very comfortable and soft fabric. Hides the problem areas.  Very flattering.
