It's a perfect fit!!! I bought a 2x and I'm 270 5'7".


Bought and wore this for my bachelorette party. It was really cute, and you have a lot of options on how to wear the top...I wore it as a one shoulder. Would definitely like to have this in another color.


Just wasn't what I expected so I returned it.


i love this dress!!! omg

You can dress up or down... amazing color , love it!


I love this dress.


Love the dress! I will getting another!! Got the white for a upcoming cruise and will thinking another color b4  I leave! Im 5'3, 165, 38C. Got a XL and it fits great! A little long on me since Im short and got a bigger size but it still looks fantastic!


Looks and fits cute and true to size.


I ordered a large and it fit big. I should've taken into consideration the material used for this beautiful dress and ordered a medium. It still looked nice though.
