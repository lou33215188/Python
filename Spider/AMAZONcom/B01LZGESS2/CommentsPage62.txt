Absolutely love this dress! Bought four different colors and plan to buy more. I get so many compliments on this dress. It is very comfortable and looks amazing.


Beautiful and flattering design but the blue was duller than I expected? ğŸ˜•


I was expecting more of a Royal Blue however, the dress is still pretty!


this fit well


LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress. I have a bit of a belly so this dress hid that..Great quality. I got it in olive green


I love this dress! Im a curvy girl and everything about this dress is perfect. I wore the black one for my birthday, and am ordering another one in a different color.


Looks very nice and fits perfectly


Quality of the dress looks cheap. It's really transparent and my underwear can be easily seen.


I return the dress but It takes so long for them to receive it. I don't know if anything goes wrong with the return process. It's been three weeks now and It still shows that the item hasn't been received.


This is an awesome dress fit as expected, it went great with my shoes and it was comfortable.


Soft, stretchy opaque material fit true-to-size (American).  Seems well-made and wonderful.


Sexy and stretchy... perfect for my upcoming cruise!
