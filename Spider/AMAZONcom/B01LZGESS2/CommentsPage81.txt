I was just to short for it.  But color was pretty.


Perfect for curvy chicks! fits well, no riding up.


It fits well and is comfortable


Fast shipping and product was in great packaged condition. I like this dress. If I had to go back, I wouldn't have bought it. Too revealing for me.


really cute dress! the material is kinda thick but its comfortable. I ordered in white for an all white party. Would order again in different colors.


Great fit.


See through and looked like I got in a fight with a giant sheet. Not flattering for my body at ALL


This is BEYOND cheap quality. I could find much better quality at GenX! Wow! Fabric is very heavy and stiff! I understand the price is low but this isnt worth $3! Sending this garbage back!


Love it!! I am curvy, 5”3 156lbs and ordered a large. It fit perfect !! I ordered two other colors. The material is good not see through at all ... and it doesn’t look cheap.


Style is cute. I'm 5'1" and 120lbs and ordered in a M. Had to return because it was a little big.
