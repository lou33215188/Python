Fit very well.  Camouflaged my lil belly.  Was very sexy in it.


I'm giving it a three star because the large was to loose on the shoulders. Therefore I had to return it.


Absolutely loved it. After reading many reviews I decided to get it a large and it fit very nice. I could have purchased in medium (I am 150, 5' 1" tall), but I did not want the dress to fit too tight. The blue is rich and beautiful.


Dress looks like description but runs very small and very fitted. Quick turn around on delivery thigh!!


Cute dress and the red color is perfect with my skin color.  Very sexy!!!


so many compliments, super easy care, no ironing needed which is a plus, fits great, plus it hides my belly


It ran a bit big, had to exchange for a smaller size. But the dress is very flattering.


Love this dress. Flows beautify when worn. So beautiful I ordered another in different color!


Fits great, cute dress for Saturday errands when you need a little lift.


Great color, goes with everything.


It's okay. Runs big. Maybe with the right size I would love it.
