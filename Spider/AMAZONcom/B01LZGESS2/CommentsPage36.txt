Looks great. Fits great. I'm 5'7 190 lbs ordered xl and it's perfect. Thick material. I ordered black so I can't say much about it being sheer.


The top overlay is a little too much material. Definitely a clubbing outfit.


I fell inlove with this dress! the color is what I liked the most. plus it hides all that belly fat :)....ladies it's a must have...i got a large am 5'5 175lbs, fits perfectly.


I was a little skeptical about how it would fit on me when buying. Especially since I don't usually buy clothes online. But, I'm glad I went through with the purchase. Everyone complimented my dress and asked where I got it from. Great dress for an even better price.


Wow!  I am always a bit worried when ordering clothes online because sometimes you aren't exactly sure what you're going to get or how it will fit and look once you try it on.  This dress is perfect!  I am a bigger girl with quite a tummy pooch, but this dress hides it perfectly and makes me feel sexy.  Very happy with this purchase.  Oh, and it's stretchy!  Enough said!


Great dress for the price! Fits well and is flattering. I'm 5'7 130lbs and the medium was perfect.


Love this dress. I am 5' 1 1\2in 124lb. Ordered a small and it fits so good. The top hides my problem area in gut and those stupid love handles. I can make it longer or pull up a bit for shorter. Material is soft. Alittle wrinkly but I will work with that. Under the top is arm holes and that helps keep top on. This is my Vegas dress:)


Love this. Everyone loves it on me. Makes me feel beautiful when I go out. No regrets


I was surprised by the fit.  It really grabs your figure.  Not too short.  and cloaks other areas with a look of mystery.


I purchased the olive green & the black dress.  My husband & I love the fit! I'm 5'2 size 41 bust; 35 waist; 46 hips weighing 180.  The large fits great. If I had bought a large it would be to big. But it definitely hides the flaws around your mid section if any.
