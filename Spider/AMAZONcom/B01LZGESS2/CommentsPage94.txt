Very sexy


Bought this dress a couple months ago and I absolutely love it. You can dress it up or down. I even wore it with cowboy boots and it was so cute!


Good fit and as there are no tags it doesn't matter which way you put it on.....it looks the same. I like that it hides my pouch


Bad material not well made.


Dress fits as expected, and is very beautiful and will be perfect to wear for multiple occasions.


Just perfect


Fit just right!!!!!!!!


I didnt like the dress. Hem was loose on the bottom seam of the dress.


Should've gotten all the colors!


Great fit, very sexy
