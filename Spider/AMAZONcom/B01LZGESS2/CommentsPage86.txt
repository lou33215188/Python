reshapes the awkward pear body and covers most evils with ease. comfy, dress up or down.  make is a bit cheap...but heck...it was cheap. love it.


Dress is cute for the price.  The drape hangs too long on the arms.  If that were a bit shorter I would have given it 4 stars.


Fits great


So flattering, even if you have a "mommy tummy"!! It hides what you want and accentuates the good ;). Wore this to a beach wedding and I received lots of compliments!


Super cute dress!  Very forgiving and roomy tho...don’t “size-up”.


Nice fit, Love the dress, sexy fit and comfortable.  Came exactly as expected.

Amazing dress!! Can't believe it came for such a low price. My love handles are taken care of n curves are accentuated while in this dress !!!


Fits nice as I am a bit fluffy around the edges.


Looks cute, love the color. However the top is a bit large and the bottom is long. I am 5'2  and pull the shirt portion above my belly button.
