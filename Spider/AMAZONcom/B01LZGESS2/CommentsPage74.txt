I love this dress!  It is comfortable and sexy.  I am a plus size curvy chic and this dress hides the trouble area ( my stomach) while showing off the best parts.  Thinking about ordering in black.


I'm only 5'3 so the dress was very long on me and the drape/fringe thing was heavy. I thought the material would be thin but it was like old school table cloth thick. I had to send it back and buy a dress locally.


Not what I expected.  Feels cheap and weird on.


I love this dress.
