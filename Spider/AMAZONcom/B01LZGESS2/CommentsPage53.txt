Do not iron this dress!


On the night of my boyfriend bday party I tried to iron the dress and the moment the iron touched the material, a hole was burned in to the dress.


Since i loved the dress anyway, i concealed the hole with tape and a safty pin, and went out for the night and everything was perfect.


This dress is super cuter and extremely comfortable!  Ordered this in multiple colors: black is great, returned white as it is see through and the green is an awful color of green (army green with a touch of brown)


Nice dress and fits good in all the right places but comfortable to move and dance in


This is a great dress.  Looks very good on.  I received lots of compliments on it.  Fits nicely  Color is beautiful.


Loved the dress very true to size


Love this dress! Fits exactly as expected. I'm t


5ft7in and wear a lodge but purchased an XL to be in the safe side and glad I did. Fits to my shape yet comfortable. Absolutely recommend this for date or girls night


very Good


This dress was BEAUTIFUL & I received soooo many comments on it!! I especially love the fact that it hid my stomach & back rolls!!! LOL!


i ordered this dress and it was very poorly made.  It reminds me of something we made in home economics class when you're learning to sew.  the front of the dress did not come to a point as is does in the photo.  I was not able to do a one shoulder up and one down situation and the fabric just wasn't a good quality.


Bought purple dress for Prince event so It works. I'm 5'5 168 lbs 38 D and I ordered a Large. Fit comfortably and stretchy. Felt top portion could have been a bit smaller.
