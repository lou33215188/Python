Seams like every thing I order is to small, so I order this 1 bigger and it is true to the chart. My fault. It is a great looking outfit.


The material is so soft and it actually fits me!! I’m tall so it’s amazing to have a dress that fits AND is super cute!


very cute can where it 3 ways but i ordered it in an xl and i should have ordered my reg size


Love this simple slip on dress. Makes it look like you did a lot to get dressed.


Great dress I love how versatile it is...the top part covers any belly bulge you my have which was perfect for me, however it’s a little big, I am 5’4, 175, I ordered an XL and might have been able to get away with a Large.


Fabric is perfect for summer.


Perfect fit. Nice material and overall look for super affordable price. I’m pleased!


too big so i sent it back, but it was cute... wish i would've gotten smaller size


The dress fits great and is really cute. I am about 5'8' and 160lbs and I ordered a Medium. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the material is thin and kind of see through. I will have to wear a slip or something underneath.


absolutely beautiful..


this is a real bargain. My girlfriend loves it and looks so HOTTT in it....


I love this dress. Hides the one area I'm really self conscious about after having 2 big babies. Can't wait to get my second one in the mail this week!
