Loved it!!


Not what I expected it look a little cheap but the review pictures were much better than what my dress looks like on me all in all it was ok


You're going to love the dress it hides imperfections and looks great. I'm going to buy it in other colors. It will fit just as you would hope.


Loved it so much just got another color


Sexy however its slightly uncomfortably to wear over both shoulders!


Fits perfectly. I'm 5'1 and 125 and got a size small. Love the fabric and fit. If highly recommend this dress.


heavy to wear


Very stretchy.


Very cute on. I was a little apprehensive when I took it out if the package. Ladies, it fits snug and the top covers the mid section if that area needs a little work. I love it!  It's great for an all white party. About to order in a different color for another occasion!


Nice Dress, wore it to an evening cocktail attire wedding. Peobably would be perfect for either Fall or Winter!
