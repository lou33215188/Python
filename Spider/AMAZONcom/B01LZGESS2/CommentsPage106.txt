Runs a little big...but overall looks great on.


I was really surprised with the fit of this dress.  The material isn't my fave but once you put it on, the magic starts.  I am 5'3 and weigh around 180 or so pounds and carry weight around my belly area and it's always something that I want to hide.  Putting on this dress made me feel sexy and and it hugged curves in all the right places.  Belly fat? The design does a great camouflage job, hiding the belly area.  I love the design of this dress so much that I order it in 3 different colors.  Try it out and plan to go out for a night on the town, it's a head turner!


Beautiful and sexy dress. Love the fit.


It conforms to your body to accentuate the curves while also hiding your waistline somehow.


I call it my magic dress. Lol
