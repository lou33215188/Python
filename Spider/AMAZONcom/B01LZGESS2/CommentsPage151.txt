Absolutely love this dress...am going to buy in other colors!


I love â�¤ï¸� the dress ğŸ‘— it's so cute


Great quality, fits nicely. Fast shipping.


LOVE this so so much


Im tall (5'8) have huge boobs (DD), medium frame (size 10), thick legs and this dress fits like a glove!  Very cute.  Well made


Fits great even for women with a lot of front if you know what I mean


Shocked how well this fit & how great the material was. I ordered a medium as a last minute dress for a all white party. Fits like a glove & hid my imperfections perfectly.


Very cute and soft, but hugged my stomach a bit tighter than expected.


It kinda runs on the larger side especially it's a stretch material but it still looks good. I kinda feel like a tent in it tho since a smaller woman with big chest


I really like it. Fits perfectly and very flattering.
