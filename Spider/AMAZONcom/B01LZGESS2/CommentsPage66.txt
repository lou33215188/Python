Nice dress fits perfectly.


Perfect night out dress!  Hubby likes it a lot - lol


Love it, I want it in different colors.  And goes with lots of shoe styles, just a drop of a side changes the


I love this dress. True to size, comfortable and CUTE!!! Just ordered another one in red.


Fit's very nice. may considered another color later.


I loved the dress however since it say it runs small, I'm a medium so I bought it large. I'm not returning it. I'm just gonna pay to have it tailored. If you buying this dress, get your regular size or even a size smaller. I think I could've get away buying a small.


It a pretty dress  but it's see through


Really comfortable and looks classy. Great buy for the money. You will not be disappointed.


The customer reviews were very helpful.  I needed a drop-dead gorgeous dress for my girlfriend's 50th birthday party.  I did great with this choice.  I ordered XL.  The dress is flattering and hides the unflattering areas.

Too much material in the overlay. Would've loved it if it were less material on top but same look
