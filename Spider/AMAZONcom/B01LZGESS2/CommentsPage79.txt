My wife loves it


It was too big


Its a beautiful dress!! Its very comfortable and the material is soft. I couldve gone with a medium though.


This is by far my favorite dress - so cute and comfy for summer and winter!


The material is awful..looks like a sheet


I ordered up a size just to be sure and I actually could have stuck to my regular size.


Bought size 1x. Fits perfect. Colour is a bit lighter than I expected.


This dress is so flattering on any body type. It fit true to size. I am so happy I purchased it and can't wait to wear it for my Birthday.


Such a cute simple dress!


The dress fit perfect and the material was nice.  The only thing I did not like was the fabric on the top.  There was too much.  Not what it looks like in the picture
