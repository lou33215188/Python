nice but larger than expected


Fabric is very cheap.  Does not look elegant or "silky" like in the picture. But the package and tags got thrown away so now I can't return the ugly thing.


Sexy, fits perfectly lots of compliments


Plain and boring... no where near appealing. Will take lots of accessories.


Love love


I really liked this dress.  It fit in all the right places.


Wore this dress on an  All White Party for a cruise.  It is real white.  Fits great.  Compliments a curvy figure.


great outfit! it fit perfectly


Its OK.


I just received this in white and I love it. It runs a little big. I have a big bust but small hips and I should have ordered a medium but its stretchy material so it works fine.
