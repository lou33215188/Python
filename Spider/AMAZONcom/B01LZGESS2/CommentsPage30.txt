The size was as expected but the fit was awkward, it was not flattering to the body and Im small framed. I have a large bust and it did not look good. Cheap material


Another must have...got this dress for a wedding with matching color heels from jcpenny and I gotta tell ya I looked like I spent 300.00 buck . I am 5" 7 , 140# size 36C and got a small in this dress.


Love this dress you can dress it up or down. The fit was true to size. An the  Material of the dress wasn't bad either very comfy


I love this dress. I got many compliments after wearing it to an all white party. I love that it is tight and shows off the curves yet hides the tummy. Because of my curves though and the material it does start to ride up as you walk so you'll have to keep pulling it down. That's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. If you have hips like me you're probably used to that though.


I'm a size 14 and the XL fit well.  It's close fitting material that conceals all the problem areas.


This dress was a hit at the white party I attended reveived many compliments and it was very comfortable.


Arrived on time and it met as described . Super cute and very affordable Wore to my 30th year class reunion. Stretchy / Jersey like material mixed with spandex. but not see through .


I ordered a size down and it fits perfect due to other comments on size. Very cute and sexy. Love it. Thanks


this dress is cute but somewhat large, buy a size smaller. to bad i cannot return it, i live in the Caribbean.
