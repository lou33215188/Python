Love this dress! Very flattering, hides the belly bulge!


After reading many of the reviews this dress was by far the hardest decision. When I received the dress it was package nicely. I ordered the white dress in a medium. I was a little hesitant being that I gained almost 10lbs in 3 weeks.  I went from 158 pounds to 166. I'm 5'5 with a nice shape. I have plenty of hips to go with my curves. The dress actually fit perfectly but a little big a the top. Which was surprisingly because I'm a 34/36 DD. Now the bottom part fit like a glove. Top it off I received many compliments from male and female.


Fabric is a little see through, especially the bottom portion, but other than that it's a great dress! Fit as expected and was super cute!


Love ❤️ the color!!! It's the perfect night on the town attire ~fits comfortable


I bought this dress to wear out for a night on the town. I'm 5'9, 245, and 40dd. The Xl fits perfectly! I'm glad I bought it.


The dress is really cute. I ordered one size up and it's almost too big but it will work.


loved how it's shown on plus sized women too. look super cute on and hides all the areas I want hidden.


Super sexy and i can adjust the length as needed.


Love!! So sexy!! Fits like a glove!
