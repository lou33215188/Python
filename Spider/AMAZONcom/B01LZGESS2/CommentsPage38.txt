Beautiful dress,  I am 5'3 and 120 pounds. I have a slight tummy. The dress is beyond comfortable and looks awesome! Hides any little imperfection! I purchased a medium!


Very sexy and fun. I got it in purple. You can wear it three ways. The only downside it that the material is a bit hot.


Did not like the fabric at all, it was too "cheesy" looking.  Returned it.


I am happy with this buy, and I normally donâ€™t buy clothes online.. I have gained about 20 lbs so I am self conscious with how my body would look in this dress. But Thank God, it fits perfectly and looks great!


It was exactly what I was looking for. The fit was perfect, not big, not small. It is not see through. Packing could've been better as it comes in a little plastic resealable bag (looks like a zipploc bag) but that doesn't take away from the quality of the product.


I got so many compliments!


Love...Should have gotten a brighter color. I purchased BLK. I could have purchased a size down. It fits well. I purchased XXL. I'm a size 16-18


This is really cute and flattering.Might be my birthday dress :)


Cute simple dress. pretty basic but you can dress it up with some jewelry. I ordered a size up and it was still a little small. I recommend ordering one size up.


I am so pleased with this dress. It flatters a curvy figure and I got multiple compliments on it. Also like the styling variations for the arms


Used for my bachelorette party... support core but see through
