I have 4 and will be purchasing the other colors asap. Hides all the flaws and accentuates exactly what you want. Very sexy feel and look for all figures...


I wasn't crazy about the material on this dress but the cut & style are very flattering. Can't beat the price.


Fits perfect. I wear a dress size 4. 5'8" 130lbs. I ordered a small. Material is a little thin, but as expected for price. Will work for a night out...


My wife loved her dress and it was true to size.


Cute, but cheap material.


I loved the quality of the material and the comfort fit.


Love it! Canâ€™t wait to wear it to the Wine Divas on the 20th!


I got this for my wife and she just loves it, the material is very soft she loves the way it feels. She canâ€™t wait to wear it to dinner. The only thing Iâ€™m not happy about is the wait time to get all my items, Amazon is so slow.


After having several children I wanted a dress that was comfortable, would hide my belly, and make me feel beautiful. This dress did it.


OMG!!! Just got my dress and I LUV IT!! Thanks to the reviews I purchased the right size...I'm 5'2" and abt 150lbs I would've normally got a Large but after reading the reviews I got a Medium and it fits perfect..abt to order 2 more colors!!!!ğŸ˜‰ğŸ‘�
