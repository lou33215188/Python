Dress is more like a slinky material.  Looks great though! Definitely runs on the larger size.  I'm an xl in all clothes so I bought an xl. But I should have bought a L


Y’all...buy this!!! I was reluctant because of my tummy but this dress is awesome!!!! I am 5’4” and 145 lbs. and wear a 36” DD and (black) size Medium fit me perfectly!! I think if I were 10 lbs heavier, it would still fit great!! Buy it!!


I am a size 12 and 5ft 2in and this dress is perfect. I bought the blacK in XL but it was a little too long and did not fit as the dress should.  But I kept it and decided to order the large in green. Glad I did because this one fits me much better. Nice thick material and super comfy!  I wear them on date night with my hubby. Beautiful!


Cheap material. Doesn't quite look like the picture.


I received so many compliments on this dress, which I wore to a wedding.  It is extremely flattering, with the ability to hide your tummy or show it off.  One of my best clothing purchases on Amazon.


Absolutely love this dress.  The wrinkles from shipping fell out with steam.  It fits like a custom tailored dress.  Now to find the perfect shoes.


I got a small and it was HUGE! I’m 4’11 135lbs and curvy. The top part almost covered my whole butt. RETURNING


Amazing purchase, really...no lie. You can dress it up with heels or dress it down with a jacket and flats..I ordered a size up because I thought it would be too tight but a 2XL would of fit perfect. I just had a baby, it hides my baby fat very well. I am going to purchase more colors. Thank you!


This is a wonderful dress as casual everyday, evening, beach, etc., depending on how you want to dress it up or down. I have the green one and have worn it twice; each time I've received 2 complements at each event. It's also a great travel dress as well. Will soon order the red one for the Holidays. Yay!


Really cute!!! I got a large  as it fits well.
