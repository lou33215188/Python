Loved the dress very comfortable and could be dressed up or down.


Order size down runs big love this dress!!


Is just as pictured, and fit true to size. I bought black and It looks great on me! I'm VERY excited to wear it out. The material is heavy enough to hang properly bit not so heavy it is uncomfortable or hot. GREAT but for the price.


It was ok, looked a little too cheap for what I needed it for but if you're looking for a forgiving dress for daytime or a bbq this is perfect.


Perfect dress! I'm large on top 36DD and this dress looks so flattering! Hides the mid area and makes me look tiny. I ordered a mediu and the fit is perfect.


I was confused by the reviews so I went a size larger. I really like the material and the style. The top part was way too big even as 1 size bigger. I would get my true size. Nice dress. Very different look.


Love it! Fits perfectly. You can wear the top straight across your shoulders, or a little pulled up on top of your shoulders. Made of polyester, so may be too hot in the summer time where I live. But worth for the money. Fun dress!


I absolutely love this dress! It's very comfortable as the material strestches but is thick and sturdy. If your self conscious about your belly this dress takes care of covering all these insecurities. I'm 5'3 150lbs and the large fit perfect and comfortable! I'm hoping to get a 2nd one in a different color soon!


I bought one and loved it do much I bought 2 more.  It came fast and I was impressed with the dress.  Super cute. My.other in law even ordered one as well for my wedding.


Love this style! This is the second time I've ordered this dress (different colors), and I'll probably order it again in one more color.
