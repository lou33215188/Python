Wore this for my bridal shower! I'm 5'5 165 and I got a small. Got the black and white dresses!


Looks like the picture. comfortable. 5'5'' and 155 lbs and got a medium.


What a fun dress!  So many compliments!  Super comffortable!


This dress fits perfect! I love the versatility! I can wear with one or both shoulders out!!!


Too much fabric. Made me look super frumpy. Looks as cheap as it is, you get what you pay for. Returning it for sure.


Much cheaper than it looks in the photo and the color is much light than show. I am returning it.


Cute dress but a little more formal than I was expecting. Overall though, perfect for the girl who is a little self concience of her belly.


The material of this dress is great and hides any imperfections in the tummy area without feeling frumpy. After having a baby 5 months ago, this dress makes me feel sexy without feeling uncomfortable. Highly recommend!!


Looked nice on me.


Love love looooooove the dress! I ordered one in black and it fit just as expected. I love it so much I ordered two more colors. I canâ€™t wait to wear it out in public for the first time.
