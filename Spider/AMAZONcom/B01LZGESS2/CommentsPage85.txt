I usually get a large in my clothes. Im 5"2 158 lbs. Large is what fits best. However, in this dress it would have been wiser to buy it a size down. Other that been a bit loose fitting I received alot of compliments.


i'm 5'6 168 pounds and I could have used a medium. (purchased a large)...but overall cute dress


Like the dress was good for the price fit good and had lots of compliments .  Got a medium most the time I wear a large but fits perfect.definitely hated all the wrinkles they were hard to get out


This dress was to big like wearing a shirt. Very disappointed.


love it, top apron not centered in front, sort of angled to the side.


I love this dress! It fits perfectly and covered all my tummy! I ordered a size L, Im 5,6" and 168 pounds! usually wear size 12! your not going to regreat this dress!


This dress is amazing! The material is forgiving and so soft. Kind of a heavy material. I'm a bigger girl and I look so thin in this!


Very flattering,  but the shoulders rise up and need to be frequently adjusted back to the "off the shoulder" look. Other than that I'm pretty happy with this purchase.


Would buy again. Super comfortable and stylish


The dress was a perfect fit I love the material and the color very satisfied with it would most likely order another one in a different color soon
