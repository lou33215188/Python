I love this dress. I wore it for a dance performance and it was a hit!  The material is thin, so if you are choosing a lighter color be prepared to wear something underneath. I got the black, so it was not an issue for me.


It was just an okay dress. The draping in front was a little too dramatic on me since I'm only 5'1 and it seemed to drown me. It would have worked as a great Vegas or any fun occasion dress, if the draping would have fit differently on me.


Ruffle part is too large in my opinion but it is perfect to go to a party or clubbing even as a chunky plus size lady.


Got so many compliments on this dress on a recent bachelorette party. Hides everything I wanted it to while still being great for a night on the town. So comfortable! I thought it was also fun that you could kind of wear it off the shoulder, on the shoulder, one shoulder or no sleeves.


This fits so well! And I just put in in to machine wash and cool dry and it looks great still


Purchase your correct size, no need to go up a size. Cute and sexy summer or vacating dress.


I so love this dress! It fits like a glove. The best dress I have ever ordered on on line! Good material and very flattering.


Love this dress so much! Stretchy, hides belly, sexy, and you can wear it on the shoulders, off the shoulders, and even just one shoulder. Everyone needs to buy this dress!!!


I can't get over how much I love this dress. It's versatile and looks great. It covers the stomach area perfectly -- isn't tight on the back (drapes well)  and feels very sexy at the same time. Be  aware, it is a short skirt, so it shows a lot of legs.


Very cute, fits well and looks good! Nice material, easy to pack and no wrinkles.
