5'8, 165 pounds, curvy, long legs. Fits great and is flattering. I bought medium.


Perfect Love it


Worked as expected


I wish I listened to previous reviews. The body of the dress fits well. However, the top drape is huge! Does not look like the picture. The drape also is not sewn properly at all. Luckily I am able to sew & will be altering it to fit. Otherwise I would return it. I do love the shade of green it is. I am 5'3 and 118 lbs & I ordered a small.


Ordered a 2x, I'm 5'6" 220 pounds great fit perfect


Does not photograph well in black, as the off the shoulder material covers everything.


It's a cute dress but it definitely has way too much extra material. The part that hangs around the chest area is where the extra material comes in. I like it, didn't bring it to Kauai like I planned for my honeymoon but am thinking of having it taken in/altered and it should be fine.


Poor draping. Material is obviously cheap.


Looks great and easy to pack for get aways.


Best Dress Ever....!
