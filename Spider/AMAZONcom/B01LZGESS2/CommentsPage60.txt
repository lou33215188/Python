good material a little see through but really good dress


Fits really well and  covers  my belly


Love this dress! Very comfortable and very flattering.


Item as expected. Would recommend.


Whew---this dress is IT! I'm 5'5, African American, minor athletic build, curvy, 185 lbs, and I bought XL. It was not too tight and had enough given to be comfortable and still look flattering! I actually bought the black and green one and satisfied with both purchases.


It's a nice off the shoulder dress. I really like it. The color is great!


LOVE IT


great dress so many compliments


NICE MATERIAL, BOUGHT A BLACK ONE TOO


This is a gorgeous dress!  Love it so much I also purchased the white and black.  The fit is perfect and it's versatile.  LOVE !!
