Very sexy. Love it


This dress probably looks pretty good on everyone! It's incredibly forgiving.


The material looks and feels really cheap when you first get it, but once it's on it looks fine. I have a long torso and I wish the loose top portion of the dress were longer (to actually cover my torso) but even without that, I still like the dress. The red is *very* vibrant. It's not as mini as it appears in some of the photos unless you want it to be â€” it's the kind of garment that you can scrunch up and it still looks good/doesn't get too bulky.


Beautiful fit just right!


Love it!


It fit wonderfully!


I bought this dress for a wedding knowing I would be wearing a shawl with it. The dress itself is very cute. Having read other reviews, I already knew it was a little see through and wore appropriate undergarments to assist from showing anything. I am 5'3 and about 145 lbs, and I received a lot of compliments. The only thing I did not like was that the dress does ride up a little, so I did have to yank it down a few times and it really is a thinner dress so it does show some of the uncomfortable areas of extra weight.


Did not like the white.


Best dress choice I've made in QUITE awhile ! Will post pics when I can ... but I can't wait to wear it ...it's comfy ,sexy  ,wearing options ..( as in on shoulders ,off shoulder ,one shoulder.. to the knee , mini skirt ) .. hides dinner belly ... what is not to love ! 5'6" 200 lbs (14/16) XL fit perfectly
