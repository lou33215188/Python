Dress was ok just not for me


I truly love this dress.Not too big and not too small. I wear it off the shoulders. I love how it brings out my shape. :-)


It fits and feels wonderfully.  I love it.


You will look so pretty in this that other women will tell you how pretty you are!


Really Nice!! I can't wait to use it :)


Not liking the material. Material is like bathing suit material. It fits big. It looks fine. I'll wear it out and see what I think.


I wear medium I bought it in a large and it fits fine it's a nice dress.


cut big but very nice


It looks better in the picture. The white is see through. Based on the reviews and size chart I'm a medium. It looked a little big on me.
