Worn this to a wedding. I expected it to run small, so I ordered an XL and it was a little big on top but wearable!


I really love this dress. It is so versatile. Don't hesitate, buy it. I think I'm going to buy other colors.


Love this dress! It's my first time ordering clothing from Amazon so I was a little afraid. This dress was a last minute purchase for a party! I ordered a size larger than normal just in case but the fabric is so forgiving I actually like the way it fits. I normally wear a 2x but ordered the 3x and it fits just fine...the 2x would have fit as well. Can't wait to wear it!


I love this dress. Wore it in Jamaica and at home.  So sexy and comfortable.


Absolutely LOVE THIS DRESS. Extremely flattering, soft, nicely made and SO comfortable. Ordered in 3 more colors!


Looks ridiculous on and horribly unflattering for a full figure.


Even the dress has a lot of fabric, it comes handy to hide some body imperfections :-)


This dress is great! Fits just as I expected! Hides the problem areas really well! I am 5ft tall and about 190lbs. I ordered an X-Large. So glad I did! I think the Large may have been to sort for me since I have a bigger belly area!


Very nice


I did not like the fit and it the color was definitely not the same red advertised. The material looks cheap.
