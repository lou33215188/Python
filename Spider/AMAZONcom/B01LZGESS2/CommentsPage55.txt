Beautiful Dress. Decided to go a size higher XL because I was unsure of the fit. Should have gotten a Large but all and all love the way it looks. Bought the Red and will be getting one in White


White material is cheap shiny looking material but I wasn't expecting anything else. Fits great, lots of stretch...


I absolutely LOVE the way this dress looks on me!  The fit is perfect, hides what needs to be hidden and accents what I need to show off.  Lovely indeed!, So glad I ordered this!


I was really surprised when I received this and tried it on....I love it and wish I would have bought another in another color. Even the material is of good quality


Easy purchase. Came quickly. Packaged perfectly. Only complaint is that they run big. I'm typically a small and the small is huge. I don't think they make XS. Cute dress otherwise but super loose and baggy if not matched to your correct size.


Must say I am glad I order a xxl  Beeing that I have wide hips... Perfect material soft stretchy can be used in many different ways... Shipping was free and delivered fast... Thanks will be ordering from u soon...


Horrible. Cheap quality material. Really should be a cheap halloween costume.


I love dress


Fits beautifully. True to size


Comfy and cute to party in!
