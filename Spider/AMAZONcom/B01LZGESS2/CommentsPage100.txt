Live this dress hides alot!


It fits very well. Love the dress. I purchased the olive green one last year.


This just was not cute on. Too much free material that did not look good. It got returned.


Love it so much!!!!!!!!!!


I liked the material but the size chart was not accurate for me. Dress was to big in the fabric hanging down.


I wasn't sure on what to expect but I got it today and loved it and I order a pink and a red to use in Cabo next month. Love the material and how it looks


Being plus size it sometimes hard to find dresses that compliment, I loved this dress! Fit was perfect


Not sure I like the color, fits a little big.


Not at all what I expected. Way too big. Looks like Iâ€™m wearing a blanket ğŸ˜’


Very comfortable dress!
