I bought this a little bit scared because I am going away next week but I was really pleased. Its fits perfectly. Loved it


I love this dress! It is flattering and comfortable! I am 5" & 125. I ordered a small and it's perfect.


I was totally shocked. This dress fit me perfectly in all the right places. I am plus sized so its hard to find things that fit properly. Thanks Sidefeel.


I had a doubt when I was purchasing this dress and when I got it, it fit prefectly...I'm thinking if getting another color


Fits nicely. Super fun!


Not what I expected.  It came down to my knees and did not look like the picture at all


I love how my dress fits me! Great stretchy and breathable material.


Love the dress, size, shape, and feel


This dress is absolutely gorgeous. Fit as expected. Very VERY flattering for a size 16. BUY THIS DRESS! I loved it!


Love the dress I will have to wear something under it as the bottom half is very thin and leaves little to the imagination
