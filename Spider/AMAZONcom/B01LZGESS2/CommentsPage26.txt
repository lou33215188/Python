I ADORE this dress.  Have it in three colors.  Unexpensive and dressy.  You just have to wear a beautiful accessory, high heels, and are ready to enjoy your outing...Recommend...


Fit perfectly. I am 5'3", 165 lbs. Got the large and could not be happier with this dress. The fabric is nice, the fit is snug in the right places. The top ruffle hides anything you might want it to. Great find for a great price.


I purchased this dress to wear to a Mardi Gras Ball and it's most definitely worth the money.  It was way more than I would have ever expected. The material feels great and you can wear it so many different ways. I am going to order another in black.


I love this dress! It was exactly what I was looking for and fit my body just the way I needed it too. I am planning on wearing it for a night out on the town this weekend. The material is great at covering your tummy area and also showing off your curves. I normally wear an 18 and I got an XL and it was great. I definitely recommend purchasing this dress!


Very comfortable, versitile and flattering. Casual or party wear. Light weight and durable fabric. Very satisfied!


I love this dress!! Very sexy and feels to a T..


I love ğŸ’• this dress although it was a bit big on me. I ordered a xxl but it was kind of sagging around the butt area. Then I ordered a xl in red and it fit perfectlyğŸ˜Š with it covering the stomach area nicely. This dress is sexy and light, perfect for partying or whatever u want....


Omg. I LOVE this dress and I'm going to order 3 more in different colors. This dress women, if u have certain area such as your tummy that u want to conceal, this dress prefect.

It's a super flattering dress. Not too tight or revealing, which is what I feared. Great purchase!
