Last minute dress for a trip to PR for an all white party I am very pleased how I looked in it. The material I was cheap feeling but it served its purpose.


This dress is exactly as described in the previous reviews.  It is very flattering and perfect for packing.  Does not wrinkle. Covers any extra middle you may have.  PERFECT!!
