So flattering!  And a super bargain. The light colors are not see through at all.  Bought it in 2 more colors.


Could be cute, but there's way too much material on the top. I'll be returning this.


This dress is well made and fits beautifully. If you are like me and have a belly from having kids this dress definitely hides it well.


This was the perfect dress for my friends 70th birthday party. I usually wear a 2X, but ordered the 3X because of other comments.  The fit was just right.


. The red was not as deep as is pictured, but still very nice.


Versatile dress, sexy yet comfy


Very nice material but it does ride up ALOT when walking


Super cute! everyone loved my dress! Hid my tummy well! Buy it ! You wont be disappointed. I'm 5'6 160lbs, the large had room to give


The dress is nice, except the hanging ruffles -the fabric is a bit heavy. It provides great coverage of anything you would like to hide. I purchased the white dress.


This dress looked absolutely gorg on me.  I thought the overlay would make it look kinda "old lady-ish" on me, but to my surprise, it didn't.  The material is of good quality and the stitching did not lessen the piece.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  By the way, I'm 5'9 and 175 lbs and the large fit me like a glove.


Wonderful dress. Very flattering on. I also went back and bought one in red as well I liked it so much.
