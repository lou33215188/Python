I bought this dress for my daughter who normally has to try on everything. She is away at college and I wanted to surprise her.  It was a perfect fit, comfortable,  very cute and arrived on time.  She was very happy with the color as wellğŸ˜Š


Being a 16/18, I felt really lovely in this dress. I packed it for a trip, and the fabric did very well. I enjoyed wearing it and might get another color!


Fit great and was comfortable. The sizing chart was accurate


Love it.  Easy to wear, versatile, the material is very comfortable, and it hides some imperfections well.  It can go off the shoulder, or one shoulder out.  It is really flattering.  Great purchase.  I'm going to buy other colors.


So happy I purchased this! Amazon takes a win for this sexy but classy and comfortable outfit for a decent price! Will be ordering more colors


Itâ€™s a nice dress. Runs large but price is great


This dress looks great! Super sexy. Highly recommended.


This dress makes me feel young again! I feel trendy, sexy, but not overly revealing! The off the shoulders can be worn 3 different ways! I am plus size so I always get worried about sizing. I ordered an XL I am 5'9 and weigh 240... with some nice shapewear it's perfect


Great purchase!  I didn't end of wearing it for my event, but I was very impressed with the fit and quality.  My 21 year old daughter was even wowed! This dress is very flattering.  I'm 5'6 and weigh 165 and it flatters in all the right places.  Great dress for the cost.


Cute dress.
