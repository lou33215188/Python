The drape is somewhat odd and lifeless. Definitely looks better worn as a one shoulder dress. Fabric is thick enough not to be see through. I'm a size 18 dress and ordered a 3xl based on sizing chart and reviews. Could have gotten away with a 2xl so that the dress would be more form fitting.


Just received in the mail today. Omg. I love the way it fits. It had hugs but not too tight. The fringe part covers up my pouch. ğŸ˜�


One of my prettiest dresses and purchases off the Internet!  Well-made and fast delivery as well.


Iâ€™m 5â€™9â€� and #170 - fits perfectly!! Very flattering and conceals the midsection! Love this dress!


Loved this dress sooo much! I don't ever do reviews but this dress made me look great and I had to show it off. Unfortunately someone spilled alcohol all over my dress and ruined it, some ordering another one for another event in another color :)


Love it!! I got a large should have got a Medium..But it's very comfortable I wear size 12/14..


I Loved this dress,  it is very Classy.  I plan on ordering another color


I love this piece since you can wear it as a shirt or pull it down to wear it as a skirt as well I like that the sleeves and the elastic stay on your shoulder unlike some other products that I have tried on where the sleeves don't stay down on your shoulders.The shirt is a little see-through but not enough to notice since the drape is over your trunk Area


I sized up one size.... got it in purple.. love the rich color. Fit is a bit snug, but the top part covers that up. Length is just right for me (5'2). Very comfortable and looks nice. Wrinkles easily came out with a steamer.


I'll tell you now, I'm 5'5, 170 lbs, and I have a 'pooch', this dress fit GREAT and it didn't make me look fat!  It covered the pooch and there are a few different ways you can wear it!  Love it
