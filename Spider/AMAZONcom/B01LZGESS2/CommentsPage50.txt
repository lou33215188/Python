Very cute and comfy


To small and flimsy


Didn't look like I expected.  Cheaply made.


Nice item. Thanks!


cant wait to wear it


Fits like a glove! I'm 5'5", 175 lbs. I bought this dress in purple.. and it is perfect! It hugs my body in all the right places.The layer drop falls just low enough to cover my 31" waist for a very slimming effect!


fits great!!!!!!


Perfect! Im about 5â€™2 and ordered a medium. Covers up in all the right places. I already ordered the blue and white.


White is available on Prime and getting it by Friday but I donâ€™t know why I have to wait until May for the blue one ğŸ¤”


Either way, loved it!


It is a nice dress but the sizing is off. It was bigger then I expected. I returned it.


I love it! I wear a size 14 and ordered an XL. It fit perfect! I will buy in the dress in other colors!
