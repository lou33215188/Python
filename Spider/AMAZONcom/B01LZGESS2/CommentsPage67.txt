Love this dress!


It's okay... I just thought the dresses would run small so I bought it a little bigger. I wish I would have bought a size smaller. My fault


Fits good, arrived on time.


it is good


It is such a great dress, accentuates the best and hides the worst. It’s not a 5 because the fabric is somewhat cheap (polyester), but for the price it’s a good buy.


I ordered a large, since it's form fitting.  It is a little bigger than I would have liked. I may exchange for a medium.


AWESOME. LOVE IT. i GOT 3


Ok


Could of ordered a size smaller


Cute, but was a little larger and longer than I expected. Sent back
