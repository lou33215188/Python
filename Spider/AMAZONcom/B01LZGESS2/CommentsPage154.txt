I am pleased!


I LOVE IT.


The dress is cute but the fit was all wrong. I did like that it hid all of your lumps and bumps but hated that the skirt was kind of bunched up on the sides. Also, the dress looked very cheap and reminds me of a dress I'd wear in my 20s to a night club. Since I was looking for a cocktail dress, this wasn't it.


To big no good


It goes to big


I literally love this dress so much I bought the black, red, white, green and blue! I have a belly, and this dress hides it. Material is high silky feeling and good quality.  Can be sexy with heels or casual with sandles. So many ways to wear this dress!!! With the right jewelry and shoes this could be a beach dress or a dress to an elegant wedding.


 If you have great legs, but are not so happy with your belly this dress is perfectly slimming.


FYI....the green is a dark olive green.  In picture it looks slightly lighter, but the color is beautiful.


The rest of the colors are true to their pictures.  The blue is royal just like it looks.  Some commented the white is see-through... mine is not.  I'm sure if I wore black underwear it might show in the right light, but not bad.  I think if you stretch the material too tight it might get see-through with the white or pink.


The sizes are as expected.  If you have smaller bone structure on top half you might want to go down a size. If you have full booty and don't like to show it off go up a size.  Bottom half is body hugging.


It is super stretch material though so this dress will fit, it's just a matter of how you want it to look.


Im usually an XL (38DD-33-44) I ordered a 1x because it seems things ordered offline are always cut too small.  So glad I did! It fit perfectly. The dress was flattering and comfortable. Loved the versatility of it
