I LOVE this dress!!! I have a very difficult time finding gorm fitting dresses. I'm a plus size apple shape so I don't exactly have a figure for tight, fitted clothing, but this is both form fitting and flattering. The center part of the top hangs down low enough to cover anything I don't want necessarily want to show off. I want one in every color, too bad I don't really have too many opportunities to wear it.


I love this dress.  I am using it as a cover-up for my swimsuit.  The material has a lot of give and is super stretchy.  I am a U.S. women's size 12/14 and I ordered an XL.  I ordered this size due to the reviews and I was worried about my ample chest size of 38 DDD.  I should have ordered a L, for the XL it is a little too large on me.  Order down a size due to the stretch factor.  It has a lot of stretch and a lot of elastic so instead of being a little form fitting it is a little baggy on me but it is still cute and holds its shape.  I will keep it and wear it anyway.  The material is nice and thick and it isn't cheap feeling.  It looks and feels more expensive.  The ruffle in front covers the belly just perfect.  It really slims me up.  I am happy.  :-)


This dress literally looks great on everyone, just look at the customer pictures. The quality is great, the fabric is soft and it can be worn as strapless, one shoulder, off the shoulder or on the shoulder. The royal blue color was as pictured, however, I returned the dress because the material makes it looks too much like a club dress for my taste. Not something I could wear. Maybe if they made it in cotton or chiffon...


Cant wait to wear it tonight. After I tried it on, i fell inlove. I have the black one. Material is comftable and definitely could wear it both on should,  lower shoulder or one shoulder just like the pics.  Very elegant. Will update after the night ğŸ™ƒ


I brought this dress in white back in May an all white party.  It really hugged my curves in all the right places too. Will be buying in other colors as well!


Fits as expected except I look so short in it! I am about 5'5" with a wider frame. It looks cute from the side, but when I face forward the front drapes so low that I feel shorter than I am. Not flattering at all! The color I bought, purple, is beautiful. I am going to look into possibly altering the front piece of fabric, but not sure it's worth it since it was a cheap dress.


Iâ€™m 5â€™2â€�, 200 lbs and proportionately curvy. I ordered an XL in army green. Color was exactly as pictured, and the quality was very good! Not see through at all! The gathering on the sides make the dress very flattering on my butt/hips/thighs, and itâ€™s very comfortable. My boyfriendâ€™s mouth dropped to the floor when he saw me in it, so it gets ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼ from me! The only thing thatâ€™s slightly annoying is that I had to continually pull down the elastic top part in order to keep it below my shoulders as it wants to be around bra strap level. Glad I bought it! Makes me feel sexy!


This dress is really cute but fits large. After reading reviews and being safe, I ordered a size up and regretted it. While it was still cute, it could have been cuter. I am normally an XL and ordered a XXL. I would have been fine with sizing down or just sticking with my regular size. Either way, it was still a really cute look.


Absolutely loooove this dress! Im 5'2" and 200 lbs, ordered xxl and i believe an xl would have done. The dress fits beautifully and it covers my belly which was my main objective! Would definitely recommend it. Becauae im short the lenght is closer to my knees.


I haven't even wore it yet and I love it. When I tried it on I was like WOW. I looked beautiful. All unattracted bumps were covered well. The dress reflects the parts that matter. Made me look and feel sexy. I will edit this review once I wear for my event and take pics.
