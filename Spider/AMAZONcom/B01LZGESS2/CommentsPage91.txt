Love the material. Extremely comfortable fit.


LOVE this dress!!! Fits perfectly great color


I wish I would have ordered a different color.  I ordered red and itâ€™s hot a true red as in the picture, itâ€™s an orange-red.  Otherwise, itâ€™s a cute style and itâ€™s true to size.


Perfect


The bodice fit very well but the caped top was a little loose. The material was of great quality and thicker than I though it would have been.


Was larger than expected but still fit and looked nice.  Totally super comfortable as well as sexy.  Got compliments at the dinner party we hit and advised them to get it here,  Going to order another but in a M.  I'm 5'6" 130 for a reference.


Actually a way better quality than I was expecting!! I'm glad I ordered the small- I'm 5,7" about 135lbs. Loved it so much I ordered another color

Super cute! Very flattering, the top is supportive, and the material is a lot better than I expected. However, it had a strong plastic smell when I got it. Over all, it was a great buy!


not what I thought it would be. material is too thick. very large for a large. I'm 5' 160lbs.
