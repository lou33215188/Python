I will be gifting this to a friend.  Purchased a size up due to most of my Amazon dress purchases being a little tight.  Definitely need to purchase to fit as expected for size.


Super cute dress! Fits really well and shows off what Want to show off(butt and legs) and conceals my tummy judge. I LOVE THIS DRESS!


Loved this dress. It was great for New Years. The gathered sides and flowing top covers any unwanted bulges. Yet also very alluring.


If you don't like your arms of belly, this is the dress for you!


I found this product to fit just fine. I'm usually a 2x in these type of dresses and that's what I ordered. It looks small coming out of the package, but surprisingly it fit great and I look good when I wear it.


Love this dress. I bought in white and black. Its perfect. I read the reviews and ordered a size down and it fits perfect. Get this dress


Bought a second one after receiving the first. It is so comfortable and really cute. You can’t beat the price either!


I like the cut of the dress and it is cute when you accessorize. But I don't like the material it feels cheap.  Everything was delivered promptly Basically happy... for the price.


So cute!  So affordable!  Got it in a couple of colors.


I actually bought the navy blue one first and then bought the grey one bc I liked the blue so much.


Super soft and really comfy. I got a medium and I’m 5’4”
