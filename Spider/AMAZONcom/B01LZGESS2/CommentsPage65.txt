Didn't like the fit


Fits perfect and an amazingly beautiful dress for a night out... i love that it covers your belly fat also..bought an xl...will be buying more in different colors.


This was not as expected, the color had a tinge of blue through it which made it look a very dirty white.  The material was horrible to I had to send this back.  Looks great on the model but not what I got delivered.


All good ! :)


This dress fit me perfectly I’ve never bought clothes off Amazon and was hesitant but after reading the reviews about this dress I thought I’d give it a try and was very pleased I almost want it in every color it comes in that’s how much I was pleased with it =)


beautiful


THIS WAS THE BEST OUTFIT I BOUGHT ON HERE YET!!! THE MATERIAL IS GREAT AND THE FIT IS TO DIE FOR!! I LOVE LOVE IT


Great dress. I wore it to our family reunion banquet and got so  many compliments


Love the style & fabric my only complaint was that the skirt kept riding up to just below my bum, I kept pulling it down as I was at a function where that shirt was appropriate, which was annoying byvtgecendvifcthe night.


Flattering style, soft material


Great dress! Fit as expected! Price was great too! Very pleased with this purchase!
