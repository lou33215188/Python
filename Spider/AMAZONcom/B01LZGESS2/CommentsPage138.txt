Very cute dress and comfortable.


Nice


The dress clearly was sewn in a rush! the hemline on both the top and the hem was uneven, poorly stitched which cheapened the look of this dress. The style is exactly likely the picture, otherwise and is definitely true to size. It has a nice sexy fit, but I just can not get past the poor construction quality! It's going back. I like the style enough however, I might try ordering it again in hopes that  it would be sewn correctly since the price is inexpensive. I want to say however, that just because it's inexpensive it should not mean that it should be poorly sewn.


Amazing
