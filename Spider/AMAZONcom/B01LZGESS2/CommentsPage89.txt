Love it...was true to size, accentuated my curves and skillfully disguised my tummy's bulge :) great buy! My family loved it as well.


Ordered a med. Iâ€™m size 8. Looks like a plus size on me


I usually fit a 2x but its 2 big and it had a spot on it


Nice dress, fits bigger than expected.


Perfect fit,but completely see through.


I enjoy wearing this!!


Ordered one size larger, fit was perfect.


as expected


bought this for a bachelorette party and I loved it!  it was cute and comfy and you can't beat the price.


This dress is unbelievably awesome! 5'7" 38DDD weigh190 got a XL.
