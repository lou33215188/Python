I read the reviews and was excited about this dress. I ordered small, I am 130 lbs, wow 2 of me fit in that dress, extremely cheap material, the bottom part of the dress is not even shaped right, it came very wrinkled. I am sorry if you want to wear a tent; then it would work. It has great reviews and now I am thinking those people got something for free or they all returned this dress and just want people to go over the same horrible experience when they receive it


I love this dress and now have it in 3 colors.  First 2 were $16.99 but the white I ordered today is $19.99 and worth every penny.  It is a little shorter than the picture and I am 5'3".  I probably am going to wear with matching leggings but it is not really necessary.  If I want to feel real real sexy I will l leave the leggings at home!.  Material is a very good quality and that surprised me.  I am a hot 72 year old but very classy!  Ladies my age, do not be afraid to wear this and it is extremely comfortable.  For the price you can feel great for everyday use at home or outside.


I'm 5'1", 180lbs and bought a size Large (typically wear size 14 dress). The dress is perfect! It's stretchy, comfy and modest. I carry the majority of my weight in my stomach so I wanted a dress that would hide everything without compromising style. The drape covers my stomach and my booty even if I bend over or if you're looking at me from the side. The bottom of the dress is adjustable because of the stretchy material. At it's longest, the bottom of the dress hit at the knees. Large fit me perfectly. Since I'm short, I feel like XL would've been too baggy in the drape area.


Love it!


5'5" @ 165 and purchased a medium


This dress hides what it needs to and enhances the right places


This dress was amazing on me!  Bought it for a Whiteout Party and loved it so much!  Fits perfectly to my size and material was great, not see through, comfortable and I received a zillion compliments!


This dress is SEXY!! And it covers the belly! I purchased a 2X.  I'm 5'7" and weigh...... I'll just say too much. But the dress fits perfect and actually I probably could fit an XL as the fabric is so forgiving & very comfortable.


Bought my wife a Large. She is 5'2" usually wears a 10/12 in pants with 38DD's. This dress fits her Great! She says she feels so comfortable in it she'll wear it braless because the way the top is made. She never does that as topheavy as she is. Im going to have to get her more colors.


This was a little bigger than expected. I am 5'4" 127 pounds with an athletic build (bust 36" waist 26" hips 36") and the skirt on this was longer and looser than I expected. However, it still looks nice and it is extremely comfortable. The red is brighter than appears in the picture, and the material is a very shiny, stretchy material so it looks a little on the cheap side.


I am obsessed with this dress!! It is so comfortable, made me feel so sexy, and my fiancÃ© couldnâ€™t stop telling me how â€œhotâ€� I looked! (A definite perk! ğŸ˜‰) I wore it to a bridal shower/bachelorette party for my wedding, and as the bride, I wanted to be in white and not too dressy. This was PERFECT, and it is definitely going to Key West with us for our honeymoon.


Oh, and I am 5â€™4â€� and 192 pounds, a size 12-14, and I got the Medium because it had stretch (and because the Large wasnâ€™t available). Iâ€™m still losing weight, so although it is snug now, it wonâ€™t be for long!


I Love this dress!! I purchased it July 11th got it the evening of July 12th. Wore it to my mom's 60th all white party and got soooo many compliments. I love the soft material. The size chart was right on point I usually wear a size 14. So I ordered the large. Fit perfectly. May need to order in black.
