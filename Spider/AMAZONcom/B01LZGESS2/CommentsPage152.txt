Nice, color true to picture fits true to size.


This dress was so gorgeous. I bought it for my Bridal Shower. I got so many compliments. Loved it.


I love the dress. The size fix perfectly. I will be ordering this dress in different colors because it so sexy


love the shirt but read all reviews and went by that  and ordered and i truly wish i ordered the next size smaller  but material is great love the design of the shirt  only thing im disappointed in is its too big.with all the orders i have made cant reorder a smaller size  hoping to get one for my birthday  in march  been sending some hints out there lol  but truly a great shirt you will love material  if you went to a name store you would pay three times the amount!


I am currently 160 lbs and 5 ft and I took a shot of getting a medium one instead of size large but it fit me perfectly. Either what style I choose--off shoulder, over the shoulder, or one off shoulder--it still looks sexy and "flattering" just like my husband said! Can't wait to put this on tonight, and pair it with one of my favorite heels, which is the reason why I got this dress!


Absolutely love this dress!!!! Fits so perfect and hot!
