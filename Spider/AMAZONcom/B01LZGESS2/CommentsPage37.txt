It fit just right. I might have even got a size smaller. It was better made then I thought it would be.


Love This Dress!!


Very versatile dress! Red is a little bright, but it achieves what it's supposed to which is be fun. Also, if you aren't feeling sexy, you can adjust it to find your tummy! I'm 227 lbs, 5'5, size 16 and bought an XXL


Perfect for going out! Skirt does ride up a lot but I have thick thighs!


I'm petite at 5 ft 2 and weigh 115lbs and it's huge in me. The material is a shiny slick fabric and it's also heavy so the top pulls down on me. I can't wear it


You really have to dress this up with jewelry and shoes for it not too look cheap.  It's definitely on the short side.


love, love, love


very pretty looks like the picture but I will need to get a fitted slip for under it cause it's see through.


I like the style so much I bought green, purple, red and black colors. The design is just cool for parties.


WONDERFUL!!! Wore this for a rehearsal dinner & got hit on by several random guys! :)
