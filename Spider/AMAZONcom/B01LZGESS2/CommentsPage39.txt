This is a very pretty dress fits as stated and I cannot wait to use it!!


Love it!! Super comfortable and flattering! I am 5’1, 34DD, 140 lbs with some belly fat. The large is good, but would go with the medium if I buy another one. This dress hides all the flaws and shows off the legs. You can pull it longer or hike it up for a sexier short look. You won’t be disappointed.


I love this dress. I got a medium in black. I am short and stocky 140 lbs and 5'4". Small bust. I can wear this dress 4 different ways. Off shoulder, on shoulder, one or both arms over. Perfect length.


I'm 5"6 and 138lbs and lean. I originally ordered a medium but it was baggy so I exchanged for a small. It is beautiful and fits great. The material is really nice and it's worth he price.


It smelled of balloons when I got it. Couldn't wear it. And missed the deadline to return. Decided never to buy clothes from amazon.


Okay I tried the dress on, and it's really cute, I am 4' 11" and weight 130. i bought med.  not in love with material


Love it... I’m so sexy on this dress. I’m 5’1 160lbs and I ordered Large. A little big. Maybe i order Medium. But still sexy for me. Highly recommended....


Super cute!! Good quality and exactly what I was expecting.


Great fit! Great feel! I just ordered another one! Love love love it!


Looking forward to my Cruise to rock this dress!
