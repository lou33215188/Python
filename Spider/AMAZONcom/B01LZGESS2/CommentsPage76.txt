Love this dress, I have never worn anything like this but I love it, it hugs all the right spots and is not too clingy!! I can tell that this is going to be my go to dress for going out.


love it! wore it on date night & got SO many compliments, can wear it several ways, flattering on many body types


This dress is not my usual style but it was so eye catching that I decided to order it. It is absolutely stunning on!! The red is very vibrant and the fabric is high quality. The dress is very flattering?


Great dress, can dress it up or down. Versatile, can be worn so many ways, including as a shirt or skirt. Great addition for our vacation.


Absolutely awful - size is terrible - material feels like a casket


Very cute!


great date night dress!


Fit good, a little more fitted than expected. The color isn't what it looks like in the picture. It is very very blue.


absolutely stunning.


Love!
