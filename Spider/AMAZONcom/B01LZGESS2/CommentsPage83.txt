soft and thick material NOT see-through and super comfortable. hides stomach and back perfect for the bloated days.


Got many compliments on it


This dress is very simple and comfortable. The top draping might be a little too long for my looking, but overall a solid four star dress. Would recommend for anyone who likes to accessorize or dress up their wardrobe.


Nice sexy dress and true to size


Horrible. Way to large on the top.


I bought the large for myself but it was a little too big. However I was complimented on the look. It was lovely.


Just ordered got it in today!  Fits perfectly.  I'm 5'4 122lbs and ordered size small.  Since I don't have a lot of height, the dress length is great!  Can't wait to wear it in Vegas!!


Fits great and the material is of a very good quality.


Definitely not true to size. This thing is like 3 sizes to small. I always wear a 2X, the way these things run Iâ€™d need a 4 or 5X. Good quality dress, just needs to be more accurate on sizing.
