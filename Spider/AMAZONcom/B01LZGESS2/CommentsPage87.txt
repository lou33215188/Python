I tried it on just to make sure it fits, and I'm very excited that yes it fits great and can't wait to wear it on my cruise in two weeks :-). Very excited


cheap fabric


Absolutely love this dress. Fit was perfect. Packaging was perfect. Never tried this material before but it ended up being very comfortable


Very flattering fit. Husband likes how it looks on me.


I ordered the white for a "white" party and returned it. I thought it looked nice on everyone in the review pictures. The white was surprisingly not see through at all. So the quality was not bad at all. The size small was very comfortable and forgiving since I can wear a medium too. I am 5' 2" and a triple D about 135 pounds.  I just did not like it on me at all. It was more like a poncho on top, just too much fabric for me.  The material did have very nice stretch underneath. If I was a sewer I would have modified the top fabric by cutting off more than half of the fabric and put a small hem all around.  The price was right, shipping was fast, the dress arrived as described, the return was hassle free and easy too. So, I had nothing to lose. It really was worth a shot.  I  wound up finding something else in white (which is not easy) that I love anyway.


Was able to cover my problem areas.


I love the sexiness of this dress. Many compliments


just as it looks.  fits perfectly


Got this dress for a Vegas trip and it fit perfect, dressy but casual.


Very poor quality! Disappointed with the product. Nothing like the photo
