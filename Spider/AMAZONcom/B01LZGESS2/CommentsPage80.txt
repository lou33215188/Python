love the item.


Super cute - I wore it for my bachelor party. I wish I had bought more in more colors.


I ordered a small in the red. I loved everything about this dress. I was 4 months pregnant when I bought this dress, and it coveted the bump so well. You will not be dissatisfied.


so comfy!  and super cute! Love this dress!


Love it .Fits well looks fabulous.


It is a cute dress but even when ordering a size up it runs small and is see through.


I like the material,  it fits my body just right.  I ordered it in white, large. I'm satisfied with the overall look.


Absolutely love this dress!!! I bought it a size smaller so I'd be  motivated to work out, and the material is actually forgiving enough that it looks great with the weight! ( still gonna workout so it looks even better though!) Definitely recommend it for a full figured body!


Too cute!  Love the fit@


Great for the price!
