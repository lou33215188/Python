I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly....I love it...I'm 5'5 190 lbs Pictures updated later


Very pretty. Great fit with my curves.


I love it!! It compliments my body very well and hides the imperfections. The material is good too...


I would have given 5 stars because it is a great looking dress. I got the white. It had a brown stain. Returning


I am in love with this dress, I'm 5"5" 189 45DD, 40 waist, 47 thighs, XL was too loose, L was just on the money very comfortable, stretchy material.


Great fit!!!!! Great material!!!!!


This is a GREAT dress! my trouble area is my stomach and the top covers this.  You can wear the dress several different ways so that is a plus.


This dress is very comfortable and flattering. I ordered a medium and reordered a size small. Love this dress!


The top part of the dress was too large and looked very clumsy. Returned it.


I’m 5’4”, 140 lbs and ordered a large. Top was super big and from the waist down super tight.
