I’m 5’7 145lbs athletic build. I ordered the small, Fits great was unsure of the rushed sides on the skirt but it makes your butt look great! The top is a little long but still very cute. Definitely runs on the smaller side.


Love this dress.


This dress is beautiful and versatile!


Love the style color and fits perfect


It’s really cute. Can’t wait to wear it this summer.


Perfect dress, perfect fit, would buy it again and again. It hides my tummy and makes me look slim and i cant get enough of it.


Nice dress but it runs big I'm 5'7 200 pounds brought a XL had to send it back way too big
