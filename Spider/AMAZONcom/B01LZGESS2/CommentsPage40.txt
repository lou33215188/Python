I got a small. It fits but the flap is kind of long. I'm 5'3. Its not see-through at all but you should wear white under it or tan.


Loved it!!!  perfect fit, fast delivery will order more!!


the fit was true to size and its soft and very comfy the cape part is a little large but with an accent necklace it will take away the largeness of the cape GREAT BUY


Very flattering dress. Super cute and easy to pack for travel.


Loved this dress.  Wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered a large and have had no problems. It fit exactly as I imagined it would.


slinky material , clings to body however the over hang poncho look covers all the spots us women want to hide. fun dress for a night out.


I was the bell of the club the night i wore this dress Nice material Will order more colors Sexy dress that covered the mommy tummy.


I love this dress!, true to size.... it's a must order! you'll love it. can't go wrong I normally wear a 2x, I ordered a 3x and fits well. I could probably ordered a 2x and be just fine.


I love how it fits my body, it shows off my curves and hides my roll perfectly. I'm a size 16/18


I could've gotten 2x instead of 3x, but either would work well.


For the price, it totally deserves the 5 stars.


Love this dress! Fits beautifully
