Looks great! I even look a little smaller while wearing. My biggest suggestion is go by the size chart and actually measure yourself because if you just go by your size it'll be too small


Very nice .I would buy in every color. Thanks


The bottom was VERY thin. If people still wear slips--then you will need one.


So much fun to wear. Looks very expensive, very flattering for any shape body.


I bought this dress a size big and it fits slightly loose but I'm cool with that. The material is stretchy and extremely flattering for bigger girls


I bought this dress in green, blue and white.


Fabric is basically like a latex glove


Very flattering. Fit great. I love the stretch!


Love it


love the fit!
