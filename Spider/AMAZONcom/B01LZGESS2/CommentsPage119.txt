well made, true to size and looks great


Not what I was expecting.


Though I went by the size chart I'm 5'2 200 lbs - I wear a 40 c bra this dress looked amazing on I should have ordered a medium but still cute.


It is NOT Pink ... its Peach.  It looks cheap.  Will be returning.


Runs big But is a beauty


Like it


Super flattering!


Very nice fit, just enough lycra

Beautiful dress for all body types!
