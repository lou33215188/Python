The material is incredibly cheap and the dress itself is sooo unflattering.  I was a little shocked by how different it looked from what I ended up receiving.


Save your money!  Cheap material...


This dress is so beautiful and I got so many complements at my party! It is definitely worth every penny and I already ordered it in another color!


Im debating whether to order large or XL im 5'2 i am think n do have baby belly weight 162 , can anyone advice me?  . Is it a stretchy material?


I love this dress it does wonders for my mid section ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜� I'm returning it for a smaller size plus ordering it in black


I have this in black and in purple!! LOVE IT!! many compliments!!!!  I did not order from Amazon but was about the same cost.


super cute, cocktail dress. fits as expected.


This dress is fabulous for its price point. I'm wearing it for an upcoming wedding! It's a bit longer then what I like (it hits at the knee), but a little hem, and it's perfect!


The tag on the back of the dress was missing or taken off. For the price it's ok ğŸ‘Œ


I was suprizes that the dress style really did look nice on my plus size shape.
