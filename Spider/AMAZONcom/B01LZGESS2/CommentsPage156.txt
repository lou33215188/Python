I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this dress in black; however, for the price and free returns I decided to purchase it after reading the reviews.  I just received it yesterday and I absolutely love it.  I am 5'7" and weigh 150 pounds.  I ordered a Medium and it fits perfectly.  My husband loved it as well so I just purchased another one in blue.  It's a great dress for many different occasions.  You can dress it up with heels and jewelry and dress it down with flat sandals.  It's the kind of "go to" dress when you don't know what to wear.  The undergarment fits nicely and feels great on your skin.  If you want it shorter, just pull it up a bit.  The neckline is very sexy and can be worn many different ways.  It is soooo comfortably and flattering and is appropriate for many different figures.  I don't have a stomach because I would say I'm athletic.  But if you do, it would hide all of those areas that you don't want people to see.  I am very picky and thought this would look cheap.  But it is a great buy, good quality, and I would highly recommend purchasing this item.


The dress is nice and arrived as expected. I'm a bigger girl and I like the fit of the dress but I'll have to wear a shaper to so that my tummy doesn't show too much from the sides.  I ordered a 3X.  I wear size 20/22. This dress didn't get five stars for two reasons: 1. There is no "care tag" anywhere on the garment and I'm not sure how to wash the dress and 2: I have no clue what the material is, it doesn't quite feel like a costume because it's heavier, but the texture is definitely different than anything I've worn before.


perfect, lots of compliments.


The Perfect Little Black Dress


If you are looking for that perfect little black dress for your wardrobe, look no further than the Sidefeel Off Shoulder Ruffles Bodycon Mini Dress! This dress is a perfect ten. It’s light weight, airy, and comfortable.


This dress is great for any occasion. It can be dressed up with some jewelry and heels, or it can be dressed down with a belt and sandals. This dress will give you the ability to wear it in three different ways on the shoulder, off the shoulder, or one shoulder.  Having these options is fantastic. The unique ruffle layer at the top of the dress gives it a stylish look while not looking too puffy or fitting too tightly. Additionally, the ruffle layer covers up any flaws around the stomach area that might be unflattering. The length of the dress depends on individual height but it can be easily adjusted by pulling it up and down. Not only does the fabric stretch, but it hugs all the curves of your body. Furthermore, the fabric doesn’t feel heavy, it’s light weight. Also, the fabric is not thick, instead it’s thin and airy but not see through. The dress doesn’t ride up nor does it wrinkle easily it’s very comfortable.


This dress would be good for ages sixteen or older. The size, according to the manufacturer, are closely accurate based on the size I received.  It fits perfectly in all the right places. The color of the dress is a solid rich black color and it doesn’t look faded at all. The seams and stitching are good with no loose threads. Not only is this dress priced reasonably low, it arrived quickly with no damage to the box or the dress such as tears or holes. When cleaning the dress, it can be machined washed on a cold setting and hung out to dry.
