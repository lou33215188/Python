I am 5'5" and weigh 204 so I always order a size bigger and I'm glad i did it wasn't to tight it was just right


I have not worn it yet but it fits great and is well described by the seller. I really like that it conceals the weight I've gained in my abdomen.


Perfect dress for my graduation.  Fits as expected, hides belly and is very comfortable.  I will definitely buy the other colors!


Love this dress! Totally covers my belly issues while clinging nicely to the booty, very sexy without looking trashy!


Cute dress, material ok, and i look good in it, it hides what kt needs to.  But the only problem is, that it keeps riding up, perhaps if o wear it with leggings it wont matter


A perfect fit, very flattering to my figure & hides the muffin top, etc. LOL. Very sexy yet classy. Going to go back & get it in multiple colors. (Only thing preventing 5 stars is that although the rouching on the sides of the skirt has a flattering effect, it does cause the skirt to rise up constantly--had to continuously pull it back down as to not be TOO scandalous, lol.


This dress is amazing!


Nice dress, fits as expected, originally ordered a size up based on some reviews, but ended up exchanging for a medium.


The dress is overall good quality. Nice heavy fabric and good stitching, however, it is much too big. I'm a 36-26-36 so I ordered a small and it engulfs me. It's too long and pretty baggy around the mid section, and the poncho  covered my entire upper body, from my shoulders to almost past my hips.  I could have sworn it was a large, but the tag says small. Will unfortunately be sending this back.


Note that this is a polyester material!!! I returned because I found that material not flattering and cheap looking. Very comfortable and cute though! Just not my style.
