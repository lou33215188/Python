Nice dress, good weight and well made.


It is perfect! The linen and the style


I am 5â€� 4 and 177 pounds. And bouth a size LG and it fits !


Iâ€™m not satisfied with the kind of material thatâ€™s why I returned it..not accurate in describing the item


The dress fit as expected but was a little too young looking for me  so returned it .  Overall cute.  quality average


Fit me nice and bc i havd this thing with my arms it hids them perfect


Too large....whatever size u are go down one size to fit perfectly in this dress. 4 ways to wear this dress. It's a really nice dress to have. You can do so many things with this. Add accessories, very happy but just too big for me. I bought Large and could have fit perfectly in a medium ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼


I wasn't expecting much but this dress is super cute. Is very comfortable. Can be dressed up or down! Love it! Got many compliments! I'm 5'6 180lbs and the large fits great and comfy
