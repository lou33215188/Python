i wore it on my 40th birthday and it was perfect!! they loved my dress!! fits perfectly!!


This will be perfect for a nice dinner out with my husband.  Perfect fit


Definitely not true to size. When I pulled it out the box, it looked like a table cloth. Definitely should get a size down.


I ordered the black.  I was the hit of the party.  I'm going to order more colors.


Super cute dress! It fits great. I am 5'6 weigh 125 and I ordered a medium so it would be long enough. It's perfect! I'm ordering another one in a different color.


Beautiful


I bought this dress in 2 colors. I feel amazing in it.


Amazing dress!  Thought they ran small due to price so I ordered a large.  Should have gotten a medium.  Still wearable.  Love it!


I was unsure of the dress at first but once I tried it on, it fits perfect. I love the way the material feels


I'm 5'7  239lbs to 2x fits perfectly very stretchy but I could of ordered a 1x and it would have fit just right
