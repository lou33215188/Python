I LOVE THIS DRESS.  I love the look and the fit.  I CAN'T WAIT to wear it!  Very Nice!


Great material, a little bit big in the upper part but works very well. I'm size 16 and I'm tall and a XXL fits great.


The red color is very bright and hide any tummy imperfection!


I will recommend the dress!


I have a difficult time finding dresses for special occasions and I often get so frustrated while trying on dresses. I saw this dress read the reviews and I was very skeptical. When the dress arrived and I tried it on I smiled from ear to ear!! The dress did not disappoint!!!I felt beautiful and that is priceless!


Very nicely made and very comfortable


I am absolutely in love with this dress!ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


Amazing hides my tummy and makes me look sexy


very thin fabric and runs small


I love this dress!  I have one in black and had to get a white one too. Great look at a great price.


It wears like a sheet


This dress is very flattering, covers any bulges or fits a great figure wonderfully. I'm 6 foot tall and it's very easily pull down to be long enough for me
