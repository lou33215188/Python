The dress fits perfectly I have no complaints


My dress came and so far, I love it. It's nice and smooth and love how the fabric feels it could last a bit. So excited to wear it on my cruise


Great product. Fast delivery. Comfortable and pretty decent quality.


First article of clothing I purchased from Amazon and I am pleasantly surprised of the quality and fit. I bought a 2x when I typically wear an XL I just wanted It to fit right and it did!


Beautiful dress and nice material


This dress is so cute. Fits perfect. Material is nice and semi stretchy and doesnâ€™t look cheap. Love it!


Love it. It had a funny smell but that washed out. I can't wait to wear it out. My husbsnd loves it too!


Flattering fit, it looks great on her.


The fit was too small/tight. Good quality dress though. I will give it to my friend for her bachelorette gift.


A little tight for shy wearers, and material requires no cellulite ğŸ˜Š
