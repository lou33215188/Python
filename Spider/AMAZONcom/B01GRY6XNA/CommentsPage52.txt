Looked pretty flimsy when I took it out of package but this dress was fabulous.  I'm very tall, and loved how long this was.  Very versatile dress.


Love it. I got a lot of complements. Size is just right


Well made and looks amazing on my wife!


Fits great, makes me look very curvy & feminine  -- very good value.


The dress I received looked NOTHING like the dress in the photo!â€‹


Somewhat small.  Cute though


Great fit!  Clings to your curves without being too sexy.  Can't wait to wear this when it warms up!!


Very cheap looking and thin. Do not buy!!


I'ts very nice but it runs to big


Perfect fit and so comfortable. It's pretty comparable to wearing a dress made out of yoga pants. Yeah, comfort and style for the win.
