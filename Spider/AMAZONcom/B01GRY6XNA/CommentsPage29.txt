Absolutely LOVE this dress; so sexy.


This dress is really cute, fits perfect. The color looks more like burgundy than brown but still  love it.


Fits perfect and I am wearing it tonight!!


I'm 5'8" and 140lbs. I bought a small and it fit comfortably. It is true to color and the quality is very nice. Lots of compliments! Overall great purchase!


Fits perfectly, looks amazing! Great buy.


I love this dress, it is very sexy. I had ordered it for a work dress but it is more a night out dress. It is short and very clingy. Definitely not as long as the photo.


I am 5'7 and wear a size 0.


I  love this Dress... It fits and feels Amazing and natural


I LOVE this dress! Very comfortable and feels nice on the skin. Covering but still sexy. It will be perfect for the wedding I'm attending next week.


Awesome dress for such an affordable dress! I'm 5'3" and 125lbs, bought a size small and it fits perfectly!  It's very good quality and extremely comfortable.


I love this dress it is a light weight dress and it is very form fitting, I bought the pink dress whicj is lighter then the picture but it's still a pretty color. it also is a bit see through (very faint) but with some black undergarments you be just fine. The pattern on the dress does have give the illusion of a slimmer waistline. I am planning to wear it to  wedding tomorrow.
