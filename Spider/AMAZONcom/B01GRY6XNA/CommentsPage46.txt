This is such a great dress, I want to order it in many colors. the fit is amazing and the material is thick and comfortable. It hides body issues very well, love love love it!


amazing dress. fit perfect. color is exact as picture. I'm 5'10" & dress comes down to right past my knee


Love the material, feel, pattern and the fit! Wish they had more colors, I would buy more!


Nice dress. It hugs my curves and is very soft and comfortable. ğŸ‘�


I had high hopes for this dress, but I wound up returning it. The material seemed very cheap, and I am assuming that it was had been previously worn, because the neck line was stretched out.


I'm 5'3, 135, got a size small and love it! The brown is more of a mauve brown but still looks great! Very happy with this purchase.


This dress is incredibly comfy and fits nicely in all the right places. Iâ€™ll be buying in other colors! I have it in burgundy now and itâ€™s just the same color as the picture.


I like the dress.  Fabric is thin but still look good and it is not see thru.  I am usually medium.....I order medium but it runs a lit to big.  Still fit nice. I also order a small in burgundy and it fits like a glove.  I am satisfied with this purchase.


Looks pretty good...super thin material


Stunning. Ordered this in black and maroon. Wore the black dress to a holiday party. Can't wait to wear the other one!!
