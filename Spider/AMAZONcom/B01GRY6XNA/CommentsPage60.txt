See through? And way too small. I wear an 8 and ordered a large and it's skin tight


Wonderful fit, soft fabric


Great Dress, Can be casual or dressy, could be better quality but for the price I'm satisfied.


Beautiful design, cheaply made and it's see through.


Very beautiful dress! Made very well too!


Really good material, really good dress and size is as expected


I bought two of these dresses blue and black and I love them! They fit very well, I highly recommend this dress.


Was ok


This dress looks great on me and matches the product description and photos.


Had a hole in the side when it arrived...
