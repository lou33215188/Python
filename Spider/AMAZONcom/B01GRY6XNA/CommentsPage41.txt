Fits perfect !! Love it!!!


This dress is very basic and good for office use only with a jacket. Also, it is a little larger than expected but still works because of the type of material. I would say if you're a small get a XS.


This dress fit amazingly! I didnt know what to expect but i was certainly not disappointed.. I'm 6' size 16 (curvy) I ordered a xxl fit to the knee .. there was something weird happening with the zipper but other than that - great dress


I'm 5'2" and 110lbs and the size small fit well. The burgundy color is just like what's shown online and was dark enough that I didn't have issues with it being see-through like others had commented. Would recommend this to others!


Like it!  Bought one before and if fit perfect.  Love the way it fit me and how it contours the body.  Received great compliment's from wearing the dress.


Very slimming


This dress was very fitted but perfect.
