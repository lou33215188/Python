A little bit small for me. If I get on the treadmill it should fit me :-) The quality is outstanding. I love the fabric texture too!


One size too large. Other than that, it's super cute!


I love the way it fits. Will be ordering more like it


Did not receive dress in description.


I loved it very form flattering and nice feel. Felt very elegant I would repurchase again. Wore it to my baby niece's baptism, we had a fancy event. I got so many compliments bc I color coordinated with my boyfriend and his daughter. I got it in Burgundy


Loved this dress. Got endless compliments on it.  Also,  I'm a coordinator for the event I was at and had to do a lot of running around and moving equipment. This dress was the perfect "active"  dress! Extremely comfortable and never shows anything unladylike when youre bending and lifting. 10/10.


Only thing is the colors - the red is actually pink, and I needed a red, so I went with the burgundy, which is pretty burgundy. But it's beautiful! Highly satisfied.


I had everyone asking where I got my dress.


The quality of the dress was fine whic is why I gave two stars. I returned it bc I did not like the fit on me. The texture of the dress kind of looks cheap.


Beautiful fabric, sexy cut, and great fit. I don't usually do paterns, but I took a chance on this one- glad I did. The design is subtle, and although it's textured, it's not bulky at all. Very versatile dress


I am in love with this dress! I received it on time, and just as described. I typically wear a 4-6 and this fit perfectly.
