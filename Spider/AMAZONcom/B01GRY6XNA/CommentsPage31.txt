very sexy on


Great texture, awesome dress. I'm 156lbs, 5'0 hourglass figure and I ordered a medium. It fits like a glove


Love! makes me look slimmer


loosk good


I normally wear 14/16. Im 5'6'' 205 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly. The dress is very flattering. Only complaint is that is seems to creep up as you walk so I found myself constantly pulling it down throughout the day. Still doesn't change my 5 star rating cause all the good far outweigh my one complaint.


Love it! 160lb and 5'7" tall, the large fits perfectly, and flatters curves well! The material is thick but light, and very soft


I have wore this twice and both times I get multiple compliments


This dress if for someone with a very thin, no bumps or lumps kind of body.  Very form fitting.


Love this dress. fits perfectly and it's very flattering


A little small but still felt amazing in it!
