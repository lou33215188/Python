Needed a simple black dress for a wedding. Good purchase.


The material is cheap looking. This dress is for women who carry the weight on top. I have a pear shape and it was way too big on my shoulders.


It was a bit big for me, I am 5'2, 95 lbs. The color was darker than I thought.


I have received your product. I love it.It is perfect, awesome.Thank you for thinking about the customer.I hope very soon to buy a product from you again.


GORGEOUS Dress. Wore it backwards and it looks so pretty.


Very nice, soft material, and way stretchy!


I wouldn't recommend this dress if you have pudgy arms...it just was cut strange and made mine look huge.


I absolutely love the dress.  I am size medium.  The dress fit just as I expected.  They also sent me a thank you gift.  Very cute.


Super comfortable , great fit. Very happy.


Fit is great. More peach then pink but I'm ok with that. Slip is a must as it is sheer. I'm 5'6 120lbs bought small.
