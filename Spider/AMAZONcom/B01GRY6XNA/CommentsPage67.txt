It fit perfect - Loved it!


See through


It was way to small.  Pretty dress but not as described.


Love it!!!!!!ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


Wife says nice stretch and not see through


Was a little big but a few minutes in the dryer did wonders. Great material and flattering fit


Material is cheaper than I expected. Still a very pretty dress.


Cute fit. Not bad for the price


I'm 5'8", 130 lbs, and normally wear a size 4-6. I ordered the medium. It's slightly larger than I expected and a small probably would have fit me a little more snug. The color is nice and the material is better than decent quality for a $20 dress. I downgraded to 4 stars because of the sleeves where the fit is a little off between the side of the breast and armpit. I'm not sure if a small would have eliminated this problem, but it's not a major issue. The dress also comes to my knees, I wish it was a little longer. End result - I'm going to keep the dress and wear it to a fall wedding.


This is a very flattering dress and it fits perfect . The only bad thing is I was needing a RED dress and it is far from red! It's more like a bright pink.
