Arm openings were too large, but fabric was better than I was expecting. Hips fit fine but waist and chest was too loose.


Good quality material, came in record time. Color true to picture.


It's a bit small, but you can pull it up and wear a short dress or long dress.


Not cute. Weird fit. Ugly cheap old lady fabric.


totally see through- returned


I love this dress, I bought one in blue too because of how great it is! Its not too short and it looks great. I would give it more stars if possible.


I expected the burgundy to be rich and multifaceted like the picture but it is kind of flat.  The material is a soft cotton.  I was expecting something with a little more shine to it.  I will probably keep it as a casual dress but not for the evening wedding I was planning to wear it to.


This dress is amazing! I love how it hugs all the right places. I highly recommend this dress!


The dress fit great and was comfortable but incredibly see through. I couldn't even wear it without something over the top of it


I am somewhat fit,  so It didn't need to hold anything in. The size I got fit, a bit snug, which you want. But it did not help at all. It pushed the top of my butt down more so it gave a more saggy appearance. I took pictures, will update this with them soom
