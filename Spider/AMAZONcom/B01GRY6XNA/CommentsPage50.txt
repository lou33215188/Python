I was skeptical and even when I got it I was a bit worried at how it looked in package...BUT once I put this on I loved it! the material felt nice and it fit perfect!


This dress fit great!


Versatile, and comfortable. Perfect length - I'm 5'3 and it comes right below my knee.


Dress is very flattering, I love it! The color is NOT what is on the picture though. I ordered red and it was definitely bright pink, it is a very nice bright pink though and I would definitely recommend buying a slip to go under because it is also see through.


Ordered the XL and it fits like a M.  Would not buy this dress again


Great dress.


Perfect fit and very comfy material.


Fit just right. The ruching helps to hide imperfections. I would recommend this dress to anyone.


Love the dress and the fit! But the color isn't red - it's more of a hot pink. Which is why I gave it a 4 star.


Great quality dress, fits like a glove.  I'm 5'6 at about 140. I have an hour glass figure so this dress showed off my curves perfectly.  My husband loves it!!!
