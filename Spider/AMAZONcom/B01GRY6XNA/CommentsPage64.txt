The delivery was fast as usual with prime shipping. Love Amazon. The dress is gorgeous. I mean that. I'm gonna get other colors for sure. I got medium size, 5'7, 138 p. Fits like a glove. The cloth is pretty thick, so all non perfections are covered. Just because it's thick and it's long ( below the knee) you won't run fast tho :) the texture is very interesting. I attached a pic. Good dress for a very good price. Love it!


Looks great off the shoulder too!


The dress fits perfectly and so right and true to size.  It looked great on me and I had so many good compliments about it.


I really was excited about this dress, but it is totally see through.

Fit like a glove.

Love the fit of the dress! The neck a little different than expected, but still love!


Love my dress . I order small I am 5'7 130 pounds. Bust 34c. Great customer service. Great quality. Will put some pictures in the future.


I got the Blue, Medium size. I'm 5'10" & 140#. Slender gal, small curves, and it flatters my body. I'm quite surprised how my confidence bumped up a few notches. The fabric design actually help conceal problem areas, and magnify my small figure to look more feminine & curve in the right places. I will definitely buy from this seller again! I can't wait to go to a nice dinner/event and show off.


I love it! The material is a good quality and it fits like a glove.
