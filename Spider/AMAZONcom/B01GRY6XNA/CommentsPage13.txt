This dress is beautiful, I put it on and immediately loved it! The design is very pretty and the fit was perfect. Its definitely a dress that makes you feel sexy but conservative at the same time. I ended up having to return mine unfortunately because if I bent over, it was VERY see through, through parts of the design. This occurred in the chest area at times as well. I think this could be solved if you purchased a size larger, however, then it wouldn't have the same great fit. Catch 22 I suppose. Great dress just be prepared it can at times be see through.


Lovely fit, and very very flattering. Looks amazing on. Love this dress, only wish it was wash and wear but it's dry clean. Still a beautiful dress, would like to order this is more colors.


I received my dress and I really like it but I have to send it back for a bigger size. I'm 5'3 and heavy chested. I ordered a large but it was too tight so I ordered an XL which will still fit snug with a little breathing room. I'm wearing it to a wedding in September so I'll put pictures up then...


I wanted to love this soooo badğŸ˜£. But it was simply wayyyy too big (I ordered a small). Im a 32A and 110lbs and the top part was just too large. I will be returning it but unless your size is similar to mine Id still highly recommend it as its a nice looking dress..just not made for some of us smaller chested gals.


I'm 5'9 and 150lbs, I ordered a medium. Fit great, the texture of the dress hid my little imperfections. I feel like a knockout in this dress.


Very stretchy and form fitting. The picture shows the dress up to the neck line but mine came as a scoop neck. Still really nice and fits great! I ordered a small and I'm 5'3 125lbs. Fits right under my knees.


Nice dress, fits tightly, but still good for size small.  It is knee length but if you are tall, then it might be a little shorter for you, slightly above the knee.  The color is more hot pink than red, very nice for the summer.  It was also very nice to get a free necklace as a gift with this dress, nice touch.


I ordered this dress thinking that it would either look cheap or fit horrible for such a low price. I am thrilled to say I was wrong. Fits great and try to the size chart!


Bought this dress for a bridal shower. I am 5'5, 148 lbs, 34B cup, athletic build, usually wear a size 6 pant. Fit perfectly. I bought the black, it was not see thru.
