Overall the dress was great. I wore it with 20 other girls of all shapes and sizes and it looked good on all of us. A little wider around the underarm than i would like but nothing to get hung up over. Very happy with my purchase.


Dress would look beautiful on a thinner woman. I am a curvier gal and need not such a thin material.


Gorgeous! Soft!  Well-made! And it flatters every curve!  5/5 will buy again.


After reading all the reviews, I figured I couldn't go wrong.  What a great dress, very flattering.  I am 5'5" 150lbs and I ordered a medium, fit great!


I love this dress! Fits perfectly and the price was well worth it!


I really liked this dress, but the reason I returned it is because the collar was unevenly sewn, but it is actually really cute and flattering.


This dress is still cute and was perfect for my Christmas party! Thanks!


Very comfortable and fancy looking.  Love this dress .


I love this dress! It is somewhat small; I purchased a Medium and ordinarily wear a US 8. It is certainly a body-con dress. Put a black blazer over it, wear with black heels, and it is a workday winner!


Material feels amazing. Fit great. Even after reading the reviews I was still impressed with the quality.
