Great fit, super comfy, hides any imperfections. Got a lot of compliments when wearing this.


Perfect! Beautiful dress and lovely surprise included. True to fit. I'm 5' 5" about 120lbs and small was perfect! Will definitely order from seller again


This dress fit amazing! I was a little skeptical about what size to order but the Large fit perfect!


Material is super thin and kind of see through. Pretty color but spanx or a slip are a must. Very stretchy and textured. Okay dress for the price.


Great dress! Fits like a dream!!


Fit as expected. Poor quality snags easily


great, all right


Shoulder area is falling off; rest is ok; material too thin


Absolutely love the dress!!! Hugs my curve perfectly!!! I am 5â€™4 and weight 178 I ordered a large and fits great!!!


I like the fit but the material is thinner than I expected.
