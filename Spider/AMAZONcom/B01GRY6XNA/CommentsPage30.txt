Good quality. If you go between an XS and S, the dress (S) is not going to be very tight. But overall good product for the price.


I liked it. Modest but sexy


Wrong size was sent. I ordered a medium and the manufacturer tag clearly says large.


love the fit and look but the material is just OK not very durable!


wore it once...


Very beautiful dress and the navy is a perfect color. Love the ability to reverse the front of the dress.


5,3 100lb. Ordered Size Small. Fits nicely but the sleeves area under arms are little big. Seems like made for girls with bigger girlfriends:))


I am 5'9 at 155lbs, after reading all the reviews I decided to order a size down (normally I'm a large so I bit the bullet and got a medium). The dress is very stretchy, as such it feels like it runs big. Now it still hugs me nicely but I definitely could have gotten away with a small, I'm also more prone to tight clothing so it's my personal preference. The fabric itself is very soft, and the pattern is very flattering. It does not look cheap, but doesn't look to fancy either so you could get away with wearing it anywhere. I do wish the front was cut a little lower, the top shoulder part feels a little awkward and 'boxy' but it's a minor thing. Overall I feel it was a good purchase and it will be put to good use.


Very cute and fits well!


Bought this dress last minute for a work party and it did the trick. It's more of a bodycon fit, which I loved. But the top is a little loose and in a strange way.. Tried doing off shoulder (one and both) and the fold was hanging off my shoulders too much. For the price it's a good dress to wear once or twice.
