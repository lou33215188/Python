This dress wasn't super great but not horrible either. I just didn't like it compared to another I ordered. It was a bit snug and seemed to show areas I would rather hide.


Nice dress for the price


Fits fine, feels great, & looks great. Be carful with the material, because it's very fine and easy to put holes through. Cold hand wash.


I ordered the black and for the price was expecting the dress to be thin and not have much substance.  Boy was I surprised,  It's a really good dress!!!  I'm going to order some in the other colors!


I love the dress. It fits great and feels comfortable.


Love this dress I get a ton of compliments. Very snug to the body.


fits good and comfy however the material makes you look a bit square.  the pattern doesnt help either and i may not even wear it.


Gorgeous dress!


5'7, 32C, 121 pounds: I ordered a small and wish I got an XSmall as it runs a size too big.


Loved the dress but just too tight for my liking. I ended up returning the dress for something else. I would order up almost 2 to 3 sizes.


Super cute, buying another color, material thicker than I thought
