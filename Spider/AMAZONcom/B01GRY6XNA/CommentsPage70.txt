Great Dress


Love this dress bought two fit so nicely.


Satisfied


Very nice material..


Nice fit and style ....material very thin and somewhat see through .


Looks nice and fits great.


The material is too bad.


Size does fit to what it says but came with a hole on the side seam around the knee.


After reading several reviews and looking at customer photos I decided to buy this in black; needless to say it was one of the best purchases I have ever made! Material is very soft and while I intend to wear shapewear underneath you could definitely get away without it. I will be purchasing other color options!
