SO CUTE! Not see-through as others have mentioned. I am 5'10" and 145 and ordered a size small and it fit perfectly and was just the right length.


Excellent choice, loved it!


I am 5 foot 4 inches 110 pounds, this dress was very baggy on the hip area and was not form fitting. Returned. sorry no picture


Exactly as pictured. Fits true to size. Sucks you in a bit.


Perfect dress for a night on the town! I'd highly recommend! It is on the wamer side


This dress will fit as expected for almost any woman or there. For the money, you can't beat this dress. It's easy to wear and look sexy, or throw a cute coat over and be more sophisticated and classy. Also, I can get away with wearing it backwards if I wanted the neckline to be lower, you can't tell with how the tag lies. Great dress!


Very nice dress, but extremely see through! I had to return it


The fabric is thinner than I expected, to the point of being see through. The dress itself isn't as tight as I hoped it would be. It is still a nice, professional dress and came with a cute necklace.


Search for Rephyllis. They have the same dress, but it doesn’t come from China so it gets to you a lot faster, they’ll refund you more than 3$ if you don’t like it, and it fits better.


This is not a bandage dress. The material is thin and very flimsy. It was somewhat cute but not what I really wanted so returned it
