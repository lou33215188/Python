I don't ever leave reviews but this dress was so great. Soft, fitted but not too tight, not see through at all makes me feel sexy but classy. This dress is phenomenal!!!


Beautiful!  I love this dress ~ the color, fit and style are classy and the price was incredibly good!


I am 5"5', 130 lbs with 35-25-38 measurements. I got the small. Very stretchy. Tyne ribbing is bet flattering. Love love love


Returned. Sleeve part is awkward.


Fits great. Had to return the 1st one. I'm about 4'11 145 lbs. The Med was a no-go but Large was much better! Length was great. Color is very sweet and pretty. Thanks!


This was not at all as it looks in the pictures . I went by the size chart and it was way too big .


Not please, dress is completely see through


Very nice dress. Wore it for a wedding.


love it and buying more!


I'm 4'10", 38D and this fit nicely!


Very soft material. Can use it "backward," too, to show more cleavage... or could choose to have more back showing- can be worn both ways.
