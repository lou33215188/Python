Love, love, love this dress! Easy to throw on and look fabulous. I have received compliments each time I put it on and love so much I bought in red and black! I might buy navy now too! :)


Very thin and scratchy material...


It looked fabulous on......BUT......there was a black dye that was coming off the dress throughout the night, and turned my nails black!  It would not come off whatsoever! I was very disappointed.


great fit an length nice fabric


I love it i love it omg the feel the quality is amazing!


Ladies!!! This dress is absolutely beautiful. I myself have the burgundy one. I highly recommend for any occasion.


Nice dress, beautiful color but did not fit to size. Ordered medium and it felt like a large. Stretchy material but was loose.


Perfect fit. Love it.


a little long but i am short 5 4' so i will have to have it hemmed


Great fit. I got the small which is my usual size, just a bit loose on the shoulder area which can easily be adjusted by tugging the sleeves off the shoulders a bit. It is a bodycon dress, so it will show pudgy areas
