Â It fit's perfectly..:)


Love! Comfy. But it's sensitive I already got a hole in it somehow ughhhhhh lol


Its very form fitting but the textured material makes it very flattering!


The only reason I did not give this dress 5 stars is because of the dye. I wore this to an outdoor wedding. It was perfect. Granted the material is not too forgiving if you do not have a flat midsection, a set of Spanx easily fixes that. But on to the dye. I offered the burgundy/wine color. By the time we were headed to the reception my nail tips were pink from the dress. Nothing major that a shower didn't fix, but I'd be careful if you have to sit on anything light/white. I washed the dress with line colors like a dummy not realizing a shirt had white stripes. Those stripes are now pink. BUT the dress is gorgeous, just wash before you wear and your good.


Received wrong item


Will return this, looks kind of cheap and trashy


This dress fit as I expected it to and the color was great!  I loved the free gift with it as well. It matches the dress and will be perfect at the fall wedding I'm attending!


I ordered this dress in red for a Christmas party.  The party is tomorrow and I finally got the dress due to bad weather, but it is HOT PINK not red.


lovely dress! its very comfortable and flattering for us curvier girl.


Not a pretty dress. The style us old and the fit is too tight! I returned it!
