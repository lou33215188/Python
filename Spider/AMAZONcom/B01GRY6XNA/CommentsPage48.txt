Thin and cheap


Very nice


The collar is a bit too low for me.


I looked at so many dresses and decided on this one, I’m glad I did it fits like a glove and is super comfortable. I’m 5’11 and 140 pounds and the small was perfect.


Fits like a glove, except the back. It could be a little more form fitting to the shoulders. I am 5' 4", 115lbs and I got a size Small.


Cheap fabric and not the dress in the photo


The dress is very cute, but it's too small.  I don't understand the sizing.  The paper tag said large, but the tag sewn into the dress said small... hmmm.  Anyway, I need to return, lose a good amount of weight, or gift it to someone smaller.


Perfect dress for work, quick bite to eat or even a sexy date <----I have worn to all occassions just mentioned!


The color is gorgeous!


LOVE this dress! I'm 5'8" 155 and ordered a small- fits perfect! I think a medium would have still fit, but it would have been a little looser. I'm ordering a second one in another color!
