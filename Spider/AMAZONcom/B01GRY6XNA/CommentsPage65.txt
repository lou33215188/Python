It was a pretty dress but did not fit that's in a flattering way. Will be returning it


It was too small and the material was thin.


So this was my first time ordering clothing from Amazon.  I have a very hard time with dresses fitting me properly - some hit me weird, others bunch at my lower back, etc.  But I needed a dress for a friend's 50th birthday party and didn't have the time or energy to search in stores.  I came to Amazon and this dress appeared in my search results.  Based on the reviews by others and the pictures, I decided to give it a shot.  I ordered the Navy in a medium and this dress fit perfectly.  I have never before received as many compliments in my life on an outfit - including this morning one week after the event.  Not only did the dress fit well - it was super comfortable.  I could wear a regular bra with it and your shoe options are endless.  I went with open toed suede boots but high heels would go terrific as well.  I honestly am so pleased with this purchase and you cannot beat it for the price!
