5'10, 158lbs, broad shoulders, small chest, larger hips and bottom. Medium fit perfectly! snug to the body but the texture of the dress and the stretchy material is comfortable and laid nicely.


Great dress...


Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, she prefers to have her chest covered even though I think she looks great in everything. I was worried that the size might be a bit small but the size was perfect when she tried it on. The opening in the back perfectly frames her toned back, and the dress accentuates her body perfectly.


Too cheap looking, cut at the shoulder is fluppy. Returned


Love this dress, it fits just right..I'm 5'2 and 150lbs, I ordered a medium


Love this dress! The material is nice and it fits well because of the stretch. The length is great too. I'm 5'2" and it hits at the bottom of my knee. Super comfortable and pretty dress.


Great fit, hides lumps and bumps as other eaters suggest. Brown really is more of a plumb color, which was perfect for me. Overall, very happy with this purchase, and for $20 it's tough to find a better dress!


I really wanted to love this dress. The fit is cute but the fabric is so ugly. It looks like it should be for a old lady or some type of old school curtains.


love it! It makes me look so curvy! I have received so many compliments. And its so easy to wear! I finished it off with some Blue by Betsy Johnson shoes which i also bought and reviewed from Amazon.


Fit great. I got a medium based on their size chart, but was too big so I ordered a small and that fit a lot better.  I got this for a wedding so when I put it on I found a hole in the seam... couldnâ€™t return due to the fact the wedding was that day.. overall I would wear this again! :)
