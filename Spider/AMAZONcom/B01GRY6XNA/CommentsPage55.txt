Very cute, tight fitting, good quality dress. Wearing on a cruise one of our formal nights.


Such a pretty dress!! The material is light and so comfy. When you put it on it transforms into a very pretty eking dress. Very impressed.


I absolutely love this dress! The material is stretchy and it fits your body perfect! I love the color and the design. I feel so mature and beautiful in it.


I'm 5'9", 135 lb, got a small, fits good. Would buy again.


It fit wonderfully and was very comfortable.


Fits great


Fit like a glove but was very cheaply made and see thru.


Such a beautiful dress! It fit perfectly. It can be work to the office with a sweater/jacket and dressed up for an evening out.


Really cute. did not fit my body style as well as other reviewers. Very soft and clingy, would be pretty if I was  a smaller woman


Very sexy dress fits perfectly!!
