A little too tight for me, but cute!


Fits like a glove!!! I am totally sold on purchasing all my future cocktail dresses off of Amazon. I am rather curvy and nothing usually fits. Both dresses I got are awesome!!


True to size, very elegant. One of my favorite office dresses.


it was a but frayed when i got it, like it was snagged then placed in packaging.  Thicker than expected and def not a lightweight material.


This dress fits so good on a big busted woman. Great dress when you don't want to show cleavage


this dress turned out to be better than expected. I don't wear many dresses anyway but needed something simple for a wedding and this worked perfectly. I ordered a medium and I'm 5'7 weigh about 150. it fits to form and doesn't ride up much so that was a plus as well


This product is great for showing off curves, but it does ride up.


This dress is so sexy, love it!!!!


This dress is beautiful! Totally recommend it!


Perfect for work
