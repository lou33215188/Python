I got a black and a brown.  The black is perfect but the brown is a little big on top.


Got a small.  5’2”.  120 lbs.


Nice dress I love how it hugs the body giving me awesome curves.


Very pretty. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because the material is thinner than I would like. I am wearing it with a body shaper so even though it's thin it still looks great!


It was so cute but to small and transparent.


Definitely how the item was described as a bodycon material, its more like a cheapy stretchy material.


Amazing fit n loved the color it was perfect


So cute and perfect for a wedding


It was a great fitting dress. I loved it. Really fit nicely. I'm 5'7 and 128 lbs and the small fit perfectly.


Very soft and form fitting. I'm normally a medium and the medium fit perfectly


The dress fits as expected but the quality is not great. I can't wait to wear it for Valentine's Day.
