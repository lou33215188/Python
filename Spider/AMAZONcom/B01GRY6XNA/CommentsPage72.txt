I love the dress fits perfect its stretchy material non see thru.


Very nice dress and true to size.


Only on the top was little bit biger, than I expected


Awesome fit. Looked really great in this piece


Fits as expected


Pros:


- dress seemed well made and comfortable for the price


Cons:


- Small fit more like a large -- long in all proportions and very wide in hips. I'm 5'3 and the dress came @ 3" below knees; bust and waist curves were low too; had about 3-4" of extra fabric on either side of hips -- plus dress' natural stretchiness)


- Red color ordered was very clearly a hot pink color. Pretty color but in no way red.


Disappointed because I needed a red dress for holiday family photos.


Amazing dress for a little price


Amazing - loved it


Loved it!


Love it
