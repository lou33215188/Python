It was HUGE on me I'm usually a size small but when I got mine it was like an extra large shirt on me very baggy. I don't if it was marked with the wrong size or it was tried on and stretched out by someone else.... but they were great at getting me a refund and pay for the return shipping so I'm thankful for that. ğŸ˜Š But I'm ğŸ’” Bc I really wanted this dress to work ğŸ˜�ğŸ’”


Very sexy dress. I ordered a medium first, then sent it back and got a small. I'm 5"9 and 160 lbs, long legs. 36C cup. The small hugs body really good and fits like a glove. Very sexy dress. I wore the low part in the front as it looked better that way. Very nice dress for the money.


its a bit thin and not flattering. maybe if i ordered it in a smaller size it would look better. its really long too. i'm 5'5 and it went to mid calf. i just looked like a dark blob.


I haven't worn the dress out yet but i ve put it on twice to try it and i love the fit  and feel of the dress .*update** I wore the dress to a concert and I was so comfortable in it. It fits me perfect I m 5'6 and 157 lbs I got medium perfect fit and strechy enough for more.


I still can't believe this dress was so cheap - it is SO comfortable!! The ruching  hides any bulges perfectly too!! I'm 5' tall, so it was a bit long on me (it hit me mid calf if I pulled it all the way down), so I just ruched it a bit more around the waist and threw a belt over it. I wore it with black pumps and a oversized scarf/wrap to a black tie event and fit in perfectly.  It can be wore forwards OR backwards, depending on how you want the neckline (cleavage or no cleavage). I wish all my clothes were as comfy as this dress!


You get what you pay for. This is a tube of stretchy fabric. Good for people with hourglass, non-lumpy shapes; bad for people with higher waist-to-hip ratios (like me). Rating is 3 because of the quality of the fabric, which would probably be too thin for an office setting, which is how I had intended to use it.


Perfect fit. Soft material.


I'm returning this item but overall it's okay. It runs a little small and it's basically just a stretchy, tight pull over dress. I'm 5'2, 140 lbs and the small fits but its snug. I don't know if a medium would be better or be too big. I don't find this dress appropriate for much else other than going out. Since I am looking for business professional dresses, I'm sending it back.


Dress was perfect - exactly as shown.
