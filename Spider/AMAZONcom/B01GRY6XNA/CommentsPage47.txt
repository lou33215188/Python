Beautifully fit


This dress fit perfect. I received so many compliments.


Great dress ordered for brothers wedding. I'm 5'7 and 110 pounds and it was a little loose around the midsection but overall the fit was great. You may have to put in a few stitches to keep a bra in place, but good fit nice quality and not see through.


Fits very nice


This dress fits wonderfully and I think I'm going to buy multiples of this dress in different colors!


Love the dress. Very comfortable.


Not a favorite, not great quality, too see through


When I open it I thought that it was going to fit big but I tray it on and it was perfect...!!!


And the color is as the pic too.!!!!
