Great dress! Super comfortable, flattering and pretty. It's not a body-con dress (the dress is stretchy but doesn't hold anything in itself) so I wore spanx with it, and it is see through if you don't wear the right undergarments. Otherwise would absolutely recommend!


I'm 5'2 and 115lbs and I got a small. The fit is perfect except for the shoulders, that part is too big as others had mentioned. I'll have to get that part altered.


I'm 5'6" and 130 lbs and the small looks great. Tiny bit snug, I'm ordering a medium in another color next.


Order up a size! I'm 5'4", 160lbs with measurements of 34/29/40. I got a Medium. My husband thought It looked awesome, but I think it's still too snug--wish I had ordered a large but I don't have time to return it before the wedding I bought it for...


gorgeous!!! I am buying more colors in this dress. I got the medium and I am 5'7", 150 lbs. perfect fit...just like the pic. Not too small and not too large. Feels great...so soft. love love love


Perfect work dress with blazer! Thick fabric and design hides all my imperfections! I’m 5’7” and 137 lbs and the Large is perfect!


This fits great and it fits as expected. It's soft and you can wear it on any  occasion.


Dress fit perfect! I am 5'5" 130lbs I wear a size XS/S top and size 4/5 pants. Ordered a small and fits amazing!


The navy is a little brighter in person, but still a navy blue. It fits perfectly and made of a great quality. Was not see through, and I got compliments on the style.


I love this dress! Thanks to the reviews of others who bought this dress I ordered it, confident that it would fit. It did and was just what I needed. I had a wedding to go to and wanted to look pretty but be able to move on the dance floor. I love the material, it's soft and moves well. I'm hoping to need to get dressed up again soon so I can order this in another color.
