The dress is very cute, but material is see-through. I'm still keeping it, I guess.


I really like the way this dress looks.  It's curve fitting and flattering without being too tight and uncomfortable.


it is see thru


My husband bought me this dress fir a party we're going to. I really love that the dress fits as expected when I received it and the material was quality material. However the lining on the inside in the front shows a line across my chest. I'll be returning the dress since it isn't easy to fix.


Bought the wine red one and it left dye on my skin.


Every woman should have this dress in her collection. I ordered this dress in a Medium. My measurements are : 38DD, 32 waist, 42 hip.


Absolutely love this dress! The sizing was perfect and the length as well. This is a tight dress but feels flexible I love the fabric and color !.  Only problem is one sleeve is a little loose. They also gave me an adorable necklace. Going to purchase more colors ! Very pleased ☺️
