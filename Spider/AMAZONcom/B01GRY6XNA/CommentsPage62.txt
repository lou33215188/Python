A must have! Great dress!


Fits great it hugs your curves.  Great quality dress does not look the price!


You cannot beat this dress for this price.  I wore this to a Valentine's Day cocktail party and received SO many compliments.  They were floored when they learned the price.  I did as several other reviewers suggested and wore the dress backwards.  The pattern does an amazing job at hiding any lines (spanx and so on).  The material is stretchy, comfortable, and hugs the body in a flattering way.  I did not personally have any problems with the material being see through.  I am 5'6" and 135lbs and the small fit like a glove.  It is always a risk buying a dress online, but this one hit it out of the park.  The company also included a little gift with the purchase to show their appreciation.  Taydey will be on my watchlist from now on when I need a new outfit.


Surprised at the quality of the garmet. Love the fit. I will definitely buy other colors.


Slim fit


Not my style.


The color is great the fit is great.


Loved it! Form fitting but not so much to show all imperfections.


So many compliments


Perfect dress to wear to a wedding! Very form fitting and elegant.
