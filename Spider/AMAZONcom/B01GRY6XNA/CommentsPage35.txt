Very fitted but very good looking. Also, don't eat cookies before you go out in this...


This dress is so high fashion looking and I only paid 23 dollars for it.  What a steal!!!


This dress is very sexy. The material is so soft! I could wear it all day.


Love this dress and it's exactly what I was expecting.  I can wear this to work with a suit coat or out on a date!


It's a nice dress, true to size, decent fit, and I like that it's reversible, but the neckline on mine is sewn crooked. I returned it, but would have kept it if the neck was straight. I may order another one...


Sending back.  It's cute and nice material, but the collar was stretched out when I put it on, making it appear cheap.


this was loose in all the wrong places and really long (5'4", 32A bust, 25" waist).  i ended up returning this one.


Super comfy. Love the fit. Would buy again.


Love this dress!! Fits every curve perfectly! Can dress is formal and casual with accessories. Price makes this purchase even better!


WAY, WAY TOO SMALL!!!  EVEN When I ordered the next size up!!!  Top was way bigger but bottom was still SUPER tight!!!  Too bad...it's a cute dress.
