Slinky dress. I thought it was going to be more a contoured fit. It is mostly polyester material. I like it but not what I expected


Fits as expected and really stretchy.  Good material and looks great on.


I love this dress! The fit is extremely flattering! I would order it in multiple colors!


This dress is complete perfection. It fits like it’s a 300 dollar dress from Nordstrom. It’s gorgeous.


This dress is see thru don't waste your money.

I wore this to a wedding and it fit me perfectly! I'm so happy with this dress! Definitely worth the money.
