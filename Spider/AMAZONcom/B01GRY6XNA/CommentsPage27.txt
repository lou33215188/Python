Love this dress! Fits like a glove as expected and looks great with some black wedges or pumps. I got lots of compliments on this dress.


I take 5 a different colors itâ€™s very nice


Nice cocktail dress.  Hits below the knees as shown.  True to size. I purchased a Large which is a 12-14. I normally wear a 10.  I purchased a larger size because I did not want it to fit me like a glove.


Super cute! Surprised how flattering it is.


I love this dress so much that I bought another one in a different color. The pattern is perfect to camouflage my belly.


Pro tip: Wear it backwards. It's mirror cut so it doesn't effect the fit, but the slit gives you some great cleavage. Haha.


The dress is definitely see through. A slip underneath would help. I'm 5'5 130 pounds and ordered small. My stomach was emphasized in this dress of course to be expected. My pointer is to wear some sort of firm controlling wear on your abdominal.


I gave this for my stepdaughter, she is 5"9 and is 130pounds she bought a small and it was a little hit big on her, she still wears it its not something so drastic,


Amazing dress! Great stretch which allowed to hug my body perfectly!


Love This dress. I am 6ft tall and curvy. (Size 10 36DD) this fits like a comfy glove.


Very pretty dress but it did fit kind of loose on me..I kept it in case I gained a few pounds I would have a go to dress....I really do like it
