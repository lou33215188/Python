It hugged all the right curves and looked great for my sisters wedding.


I really love this dress. I'm 5'8" and 170lbs. I got the L and it just adjusts to you body size. It's elegant and sexy. The material is stretchy yet thick enough not to be transparent at my chest and butt. I would highly recommend.


beautiful and simple. Very comfortable! will definitely buy from this seller again!
