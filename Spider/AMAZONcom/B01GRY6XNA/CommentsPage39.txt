The material was very thin and it appeared stretched out at the neck. It seems to be lacking spandex.


Super cute and classy. I wore it to a friend's wedding and received many compliments. I may order in another color.


Love the fabric and the fit. I am curvy and this dress is flattering. The fabric is not super thick, but not thin or flimsy either. I didn't wear shape wear but it probably would have helped. :-) Great dress for the price!


The fit is great. The dress, however, looks like someone wore it and returned it. It came with several snags and a hair tie inside of the bag. Who does that? I'm pretty disappointed as the dress itself is great. I wish the dress came new as advertised.


The fabric looks too chap to me, will have to wear a slip under this because its see-trough. Not a bad deal for such a cheap price but still not 100% happy with the purchase.


Fits perfect! Material is soft and the color is beautiful. I will be ordering another color.


Nice dress for the price.  I like the textured material so that you don't need to wear spanx underneath.


Beautiful fit perfectly I bought the small I am 34C 27 37 and small is perfect bought 2 of the same color will return one and purchase another color. Love it


It is a perfect fit. I am 5'4 around 110 lbs and ordered Small size and its perfect. The material is good too.


This dress is super flattering !! It is true to size , I ordered a size up because usually with these type of companies they run small but it was way to big. I was able to take it in , and it fit like a glove!!


I wore it to my son's baptism
