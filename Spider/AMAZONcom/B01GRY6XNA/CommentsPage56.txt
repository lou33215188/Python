Pretty. Not see though once on, but larger than ex


nice easy and very comfortable


Love this dress I get so many compliments on it it's for fitting but you can still breath its a great fabric


I'm 5"1' and weigh 167lbs and this dress was wayyyy too small. The color was as pictured however it definitely didn't fit me.


This dress fit perfectly.


Really cute dress, material stretchy and fit curves.


TGIs is a very flattering dress!


Love this dress. It fits perfectly.


Still love it just had to go a size down. Great material, comfortable and slimming.


Kind of big
