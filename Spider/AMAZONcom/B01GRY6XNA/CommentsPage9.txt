Great price and pretty dress. It's perfect for Arizona weather. The material is light, however, it has textured so hides what you need hidden.


I'm extremely impressed with this dress !!!!! The material is so soft and comfortable and it doesn't seem cheaply made in the least. The fit was great. When I pulled it out of the bag I was skeptical about it being to big but it's a spandex material and it fit like a glove. 135pounds bust size 34ddd.


Super Super cute! I bought this to wear to the office. I can wear it with or without a blazer and its perfect. I am 5'5, 130lbs and I ordered a Medium. It fits great on the thigh area however its a little large on the top. It doesn't look bad as I chose to wear it today and maybe shrink it on its first wash and see how it goes. Depending on if/how much it shrinks will determine if I continue to order a M or go down to small. BUT I AM DEFINITELY BUYING MORE COLORS!


I rarely write reviews - I should actually start with the bot so good ones to help customers decide if a product is for them or not - but I feel compelled to do so with this dress. PERFECT - this dress is absolutely perfect, it fits me like a glove and I anticipate purchasing it in several other colors. I am 5'8.5" and 166lbs (curvy in my butt and hips) and I feel amazing in this dress. I purchased a medium and in Navy blue. It's the perfect combination of sexy and professional. I purchased it to pare with a cream blazer for a professional conference I am attending but I will also be in Las Vegas so it will be perfect for an evening out too. If you are hesitant on purchasing this, don't be. It is absolutely lovely. (Hoping to post photos later)


I'm going to a wedding and needed a certain color, it's exactly as it was in the picture. Love it!


I also recieved a gift with a thank you card ğŸ˜˜ Super cute necklace made by hand!


You can't beat the price for the value of the product.


I love this dress it's beautiful and show off my small carves like if I am really that Curvy and iv got so many  Compliments on how my figure looks n this dress so sexy but very classy and it's not short at all just like I like it and the girls at church keep asking where I got it.. and it's perfect for a desk job as well..


The dress is great quality and as described and shown. With that, it is a tighter dress and the style and material shows curves.


Iâ€™m not the one to wear dresses, but this dress material is stretchy and very comfortable to wear and it is really good quality. It fits the description perfectly. I plan on wearing this on one of the formal dinner nights on a cruise with my husband in August. Canâ€™t wait!


This dress is so comfortable and very flattering even though I do not have a perfect figure. I purchased the red which is a dark rich red color. I cant believe it was so inexpensive too!


I bought this for a bachelorette party. It was great. I got a ton of compliments on it. No one could believe I purchased it off Amazon. I'm 5'6 and 120lbs and I got s small. It was a little tight but it worked fine for the one night I needed it for. I thought about ordering it in a different color to wear to the wedding, I liked it that much! I'm not sure if the medium would have been too big.
