This dress is beautiful for the press but isn't quite as forgiving as other people have stated. Had to wear spanx for my stomach and I weigh 110 lbs.


Great dress for a great price! Saw this in a item featured in an article on Buzzfeed and decided to give it a try. I'm 5'9" and slim, but decided to try the dress in the burgundy, size medium just in case it was tight. It fits perfectly and flatters my curves. It hits me just above the knee so it's perfect for my tall frame. Highly recommend this dress!


I tried to wear this dress with hose and I was a static factory.. the dress stuck to me. It’s really too long and awkward. I returned it.


It is a high quality dress which is very well made and the craftsmanship will hit you when you have it. I was impressed by the material appears to be of high quality and the every detail was very good. This dress appears as a bodycon up top, it will totally show your body lines and curves.


Highly recommend


Fit like a glove!!! Love it


This will cling to the shape of your body. The fabric is very comfortable and is a great length for someone who is 5'7".


beautiful! I love how it hugs the curves, it is fitting and sexy but still classy because of the length!


This is a really Great dress! its a little see through but i wear black bra and black spanx and its fine. I'm really curvy this fits my body well hugging all my curves and the material is really soft.


I’m 120lb and 5’2. I got a small navy dress and it fit perfectly. I’m impressed about the  Dress over all. Well made.


This dress is awesome! Fits like a glove. Comfortable, lightweight material. Great dress for the price.


I got a medium. I'm usually about a 6 in dresses, but I have a large bust, so I wasn't sure if a small would fit. Medium was perfect!
