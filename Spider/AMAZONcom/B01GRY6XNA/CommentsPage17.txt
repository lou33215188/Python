Got alot  of reviews very pretty and got just right


My wife looks gorgeous in it and she loved it as a Christmas gift. Can't argue with the price, either. Fit as expected


I wore this dress to a class reunion and looked sharp AND was comfortable. It's light-weight and this particular color is unique!


This dress is amazing. It fit beautifully. I will probably order other colors. It was fitted, but not tight and it was lined. I cannot believe the quality of this dress for the price. I am 5'3 and 145lbs, the M fit perfectly.


Perfect dress, I an 5 6 150 lbs ordered a medium and it fit perfectly! I will say I wore a cotton sweater over it today because it was cold and the fabric did bead up pretty quickly.


Very fitted. Ordered medium and needed a large or XL. I'm normally ba size 8, but am very busty.  This dress is very sheer.  I was not aware of that when I purchased it. You can see flesh.


good black dress for in a pinch, but the fabric is very thin. I will wear this dress but will most likely wear a jacket over it.


This dress is amazing. The material is soft and better quality than expected. The texture gives it a classier feeling as I wore it to a wedding and was concerned about looking inappropriate.  I order it in a XL but it is really stretchy so I could've ordered a large and it would've worked.


this dress is really great. I have to travel a lot for work and you can roll it up and pack it in very little space and when you take it out no ironing required; highly recommended if you travel for work and need functional yet nice dresses to pack


I loved this dress but had to return it. I'm a 34A, 26 waist, 5ft4, and about 115lbs and this dress was too large in weird areas. If I were a bit more curvy I'm sure this would have fit a lot better but instead it looked like I was trying to wear my big sisters dress, ugh.
