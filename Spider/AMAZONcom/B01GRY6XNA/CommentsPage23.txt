This dress is amazing!! I ordered the burgundy for a very fancy dinner for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was exactly as expected! I'm 5'8-9 weigh 162lbs and I ordered the medium. It fit perfectly and it is stretchy material so there is room for flexibility. Would recommend to others!


Soft, stretchy, great color and over all a great dress! I definitely recommend this !


I actually wore this to a wedding in New Orleans in the beginning of my 2nd trimester of pregnancy and it fit great! The rouging (sp?) allowed for a little bit of a belly but definitely accented the curves in all the right places. Very happy and got a lot of compliments.


Beautiful dress, fit perfectly. Super comfortable and didn't ride up at all. True to size chart. I'm 5'9" 120lbs and ordered a small.


I just got this dress I but I'm in love already. Perfect dress to transitions from work to night out. It is so comfortable and cute! I'm 5'6" 130lbs and 36A bra size. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly.


Totally beautiful and fits great. The feel is super soft as well.


The color is gorgeous (I bought the pink) and the length is great, it’s a classy and elegant cocktail dress BUT it’s oddly large in the top and the sleeves. I’m 5’5”, 130 and bought a S, it fits from hips down perfectly but the top is pretty loose.


This was my first purchase of clothing on Amazon.  Great experience, love the dress.  I'd recommend it to others.


Wasnt as cute on me as I thought it would be. I gave it away.


I was afraid the color wouldn't be the same as shown but it is perfect! I absolutely love it.  I am 5'8" 195lbs and the large ends right at my knees. Mind you, it will show your rolls lol but nothing good underwear can't fix.
