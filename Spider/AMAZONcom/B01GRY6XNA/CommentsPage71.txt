I really liked this dress! It fit great and was made nicely


Really cute and love the material


Just got this dress today and I LOVE it!!!!! I was worried that it since it was more tight fitting it would show panty lines and look cheap but it looks amazing and the fabric was surprisingly better than I expected for the price. I plan on wearing this for New Years and to work with a blazer or jacket... perfect little black dress. I am 5'9 at 125lbs and got a small and it fits like a glove, hits me just slightly above the knee but I am fine with that since I am so tall. Just ordered it in burgundy seriously you cant beat the price.


Loved it... I purchased another one


This dress is amazing! Very flattering and comfortable.


Sexy


Fit perfect!!!


This is a good size and I get compliments on it. Perfect


Just like the picture. The fabric is very soft and stretches, doesn't seemed like cheap material or have poor quality. I'm 5'6" and ordered a medium. Very happy with the dress :)


Flattering
