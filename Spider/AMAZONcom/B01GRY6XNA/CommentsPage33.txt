Beautiful dress! Fits well. Great dress especially for the price.


I was very happy with this dress. The material is stretchy, but not sheer at all. It does cling a little bit. But it is beautiful none-the-less, and can easily be dressed up or down. I am 6' and about 150lbs. I ordered the large and it fits perfectly. It falls just a couple inches above my knees.


I love it


The dress itself is cute.  It fit smaller than expected everywhere but the sleeves.  They are too loose and wonâ€™t stay put.  Unfortunately, I will return it


Wow!! This dress fits like a glove. Gorgeous. I will wear this to an upcoming party.


I ordered over 10 dresses because I hate in store shopping. This by far was my favorite style and only one of few that actually looks like (even better) than the stock photos! The fabric is soft and stretchy and hides tummies well. Love this dress! Ordering in different colors!


Returned. Bought a large, I'm 185 5'10. XL too big, L too tight. Length was good, but arm fat bubbled out and the zipper was wonky.


Great and fits like a glove. Material damages very easy.


Love the material...item somewhat poorly made....uneven arm openings.


It's a "pull on" garment.....no zipper.  Nice conservative knee length..

Beautiful dress for a wedding day. I had a lot of compliments.
