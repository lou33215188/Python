I completely love it!!! I can't wait to wear it on Easter.


Love the way it flows and it is a flattering style that is perfect for any occasion. I want to get a belt for it.


I did not need the product so I ended up returning it but it did look like it would be a cute dress I ordered a small which said size 4 to 6 but I think it was a little on the big side


I bought 3 of these for bridesmaid dresses. They were great. We paired them with a crinolin and some ribbon. Having an extra small size available would have been nice though.


Very low quality. It looked more like a kitchen apron than a nice dress and I had to find a different dress.


Loved it completely!


Excellent


I bought it for my aunt and she loved it''


Great dress, love it! Arrived early, love the material. Looking forward to wearing this several times this summer :-)


I bought this dress for my daughter. She loves it. Fits right and arrived on time. The material and sowing r really good.
