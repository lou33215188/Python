Love love love this dress. It's flattering it's sexy, and fits perfect


Super cute!!!!


I love this dress! It shows off all my positive attributes! I had ordered the large in Orange but it was too large. So, I returned it. The sky blue ok be came in just in time for a wedding we attended. The back still seemed a little loose but overall the dress was everything I had hoped for.


did not have my size so ordered next size up, will need minor adjustment at sleeve but the sash takes care of the rest. Great dress!


Way shorter than described


fit great, very classic look!


Cute! It's a heavier cotton than I expected (so better quality). Just a smidgen bigger in the waist than expected based on reviews (I'm usually a US size 4-6, purchased a medium). However, since I have a larger bust and the belt nips the waist in, I'm keeping it.


Beautiful dress, I just ordered it too large.  I plan on exchanging it for a smaller size.  They fit true to size, I just made the mistake.  The dress is super cute, and I can't wait to wear it to work, or possibly add an underskirt to give it some extra fullness for a night out.


Absolutely adorable dress! Fits like a glove! I am 5'9, size 10/12 depending on label, and this fits beautifully! Great addition to my wardrobe!


It actually fits as expected. I am 5'3 125lbs wear a b cup bra. I bought a size small. If my boobs were any bigger I would have had to buy a bigger size for the chest area.
