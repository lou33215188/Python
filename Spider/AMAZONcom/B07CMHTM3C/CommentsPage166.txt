I absolutely love this dress! I bought it in a size XXL and it fit perfectly! It's very flowy and very comfortable to wear. The material is just a little bit thick and heavy, but I would gladly buy another dress like this again. It'd be perfect for a 50's themed event!


I love this dress !


cute, fits well


I am 5'2" and 105 pounds. This is way too large and I got a small. I have to return it.


This is a super cute, flirty dress!  I wanted a pin-up style dress, and this fit the bill on style as well as cost.  I am about 5ft 5in tall and 132 lb. and wear a size 6 to 8. I bought the Medium based on others' reviews and although it fits ok, I am tempted to try the Small for a slightly snugger fit.  The medium is just a tad loose... but, again, still looks nice.  I definitely recommend this adorable dress!


Cheap Fabric


Cute classic dress


Love this dress. I want to buy in all colors! I got a lot of compliments. :)


Love the style and color. I bought the yellow.  Can't wait to wear it.


A well-made dress in a nice fabric.  It fit mostly true to size and was quite flattering.  I returned because my mid-section is a bit larger and I am really picky.  The style in flattering on most body types!
