Love the dress.  Runs a bit smaller then I thought it would.


Dress is way too big. Will never order again. I want my money back


Beautiful


This is such a flattering dress. I am 5'3, 220lb and usually wear a sz 16. I had to reinforce the buttons as 2 of them did pop off and I had to safety pin the top together a bit to control the girls, but it was an easy fix. Luckily we hadn't gotten too far from home and could turn around. Would have been very embarassing if it had happened at my hubby's highschool reunion. It looked adorable with or without a petticoat underneath. I live in a hot and humid area and the material perfectly thin enough that I wasn't sweating my butt off.


It's very comfortable, and fits well.


I bought a size large. I am 5'7, 140 pounds.


I have read some reviews about the bust fitting small, but I am a size B in the bust and it fits perfect.


I wear a medium in everything and have literally no time to even return this item. It's awesome and I love the quality but I'm swimming in it lol I need a small! :(


Loved the dress it fits well on someone who is not "tiny". I wore it for Mother's Day".


Super cute! I love the stretch in the fabric


Love it. True to fit and it was very comfortable.


Love the dress.


Normally I would wear a Medium but after reading the reviews I took the Large, still fits small.


Sadly I had to return it.
