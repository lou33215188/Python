I liked the length and the style of the dress.


I go swing dancing and this dress is perfect for it!!!❤️❤️ I recommend getting a petticoat like I did!!


Cheap, itchy, stinky fabric, but the dress hit me right at my waist.


Pretty. Somewhat scratchy but comfy.


Love this dress! It's fits great! I am a Medium in shirts and a 4/6 bottom and I ordered a Small and it is excellent! In need of a little ironing and it will be ready to go!


Love it


I was a little doubtful when I purchased this item, but it exceeded my expectations.  I love the fit and the fabric.


Quality is great, especially for the price! And the fit was exactly as expected. Be sure to measure yourself to get the correct size!


I was really surprised, buying this online and all, but it fits perfect.  I'm about a size 8 or 10 and the large fits perfect!!


Beautiful design. Fits just as expected.
