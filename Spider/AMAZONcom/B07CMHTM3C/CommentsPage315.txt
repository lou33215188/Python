Was cute but it ran alot smaller than expected I wear size 10-12 depending on the design...the dress seemed like a size 7.


This dress is gorgeous. It fits very well and has a nice feel to it.


Love it. Great material and perfect fit.


Absolutely love it! Medium fits me perfect!


Great dress


Dress is a little snug, but fits. Arrived a day earlier than expected. Overall happy with my purchase.


Not quality fabric - had some smudges/discoloration on some of the white polka dots. Medium was very long on me.


Sexy and beautiful.


Nice dress made out of cotton. Size M fits me and I am usually a size 6


Perfect!
