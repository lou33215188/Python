Bought this dress for my daughter. Is a beautiful cut and it fit perfectly. The sizing is perfect.


Love this dress. Amazing deal for the price.  Fits so well and makes me look two sizes smaller. Very comfortable as well.


This dress is fantastic! I highly recommend getting a tutu for under it so it flows the best.


Sizing is completely incorrect.  I wear between a large or extra large.  I got extra large that would only fit if I were a size 2!!!  Horrible waste of money.


Great dress for a stage show, or costume. The fabric is. NOt great but u cant tell from far away


Love this dress.  I'm 5'5" and 135 lb and I bought a medium which fits great.  I received many compliments when wearing this dress.


Super cute.  Fits great. Color is brighter than it looks online.  Pleased with the weight of the material.


Chest area way too small for a person with boobs


Really well made, fit my bridesmaid like a glove!


This  DRESS make me feel Marvelous  ....
