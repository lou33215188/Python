This is the second dress I have bought like this and it is amazing.  It fits well and looks nice when worn.  The fabric has some stretch to it, so it is comfortable as well.  I bought the white dress, and it is not see-through.


Love it!  I'm going to sew up the front.  It pulls a lot even though it's stretchy and a little big.


Buying it in more colors now


Great dress!  Fit perfectly right out of the packaging, remains to be seen how comfortable it will be wearing it for longer than a few minutes to just try it on, but I'm very pleased


My wife loves this dress. It is has classic vintage style to it. She looks great in it too, we will get more.


This dress is cheaply made.  We returned the first one when the zipper broke and purchased a second one in hopes the first was a fluke.  Zipper broke on that one as well.


Love the dress. Just wish the top had a little padding in it. I will have to wear a strapless bra with it for support.


I ordered up because I'm always worried about dress sizes on Amazon, and this was a little bit too big, but I still loved it. It arrived in a nice, sealed bag, and is so cute and so fun to wear. I wore it for a convention, and plan on using it again and again for other things as well. Now I just need to find shoes!


This dress is super cute! It fit slightly big on me, I ordered a size small but I believe an XS would have been too small. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.


Had to return the first one...size was too small...had to re-order one size larger...


Sizing was perfect. Bought an XXL at 216lbs and 5'4". Only complaint is zipper is way flimsy and I had it pop open a few times.
