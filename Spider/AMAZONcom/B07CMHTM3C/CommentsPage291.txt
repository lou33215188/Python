I ordered larger, per the reviews and fits great.


A bit long for my liking (without crinoline). I'm 5'3 & will wear above knees in a heartbeat. But I'm fine with this length too.


It's perfect, great quality!!


Great dress. Very pretty


The bottom was beautiful but the top section just didn't fit right. Didn't look right.


Everything was fine. I ordered two sizes, kept one and gave one away.


I really love this dress! The fit was great and I received many compliments. I had no problems with anything showing through the dress. I will definitely by from this company again!


It's gorgeous, but size runs small


The material was not how it was described. It has the look and feel of a waitress apron.


Love the print, but the length is too short. The picture is deceiving. And the cowgirls have black mustaches for some reason :(
