It was a little tighter than I had thought but it is beautiful. I absolutely love this dress!


It's definitely not what I was hoping for. Honestly, I'd like to return it for a refund


The dress is very nice, but it is toooooo long.  I like the fit but I will have to get it altered.


But it is a lovely dress.  Very sexy.


Gorgeous dress. Good quality. Great price. And here's the kicker...fits PERFECTLY!


Very cute. Had to return the small for a medium.


This dress is awesome. The color is rich, fit is good, the fabric is surprisingly stretchy. It does run small so order up at least a size. I wear an xl.  I got a 3x, it fits perfectly. I've got 2 of these. Will be ordering more.


love this dress  I am 5'3 and it is LONG... but worth having it hemmed..


Love it looks great, fabric is good, just needs to be iron before wearing and also I would recommend a piticoat


Nice fit. Material is stiff even after washing it.


This dress is beautiful i ordered 4 of them in royal blue for my bridesmaid dresses and they looked amazing the zipper on the side is kinda hard to move up and down but not to the point of ripping or breaking
