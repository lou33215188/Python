Very comfortable


This is a China bulls*** dress....the worst ever


Fit perfectly great dress


It's a bit long, but I am only 5 ft so I expected that.


Love this dress. Looks amazing!


Quality of this dress is superb. It has a lot of frills and looks very pretty. I am 5'5 and 136 lbs and I ordered a medium. Though the fit was flattering I felt the medium was a bit too long for me. I wanted a dress which would just cover the knee however it was halfway between my knee and ankle. I so so  loved the dress yet returned it.  The returns went on smoothly and I got my refund back without any issues. Even thought I returned it I would still give it 5 stars just for the quality and look of the dress and the fact that it very nicely made.


Cute, fit a little big.


Nice material - looks good & fits well. More than I expected considering price.


Got here fast and fit perfectly, thank you


Adorable for my 50s theme shower
