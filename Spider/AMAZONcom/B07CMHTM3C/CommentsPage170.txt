Great quality for the price, makes me feel pretty. Love it.


This dress is PERFECT, everything i wanted in a retro look. Wearing it for my engagement session. So in love. THANK YOU THANK YOU.


Really nice!


I wish I took pictures, because I looked so good wearing this dress! I received so many compliments throughout the night. I wore a peticoat under it, which really added to the style.


I had it shortened. Could only wear this once. The black ran all over white dots after 1st cleaning


I normally wear a large but this dress was a bit tight. I just ordered an extra large and I think it will fit perfect. The dress is super cute and I look forward to wearing it on Valentine's Day.


Very form fitting. The jersey material makes it look a little cheap looking. Would be much better if the back of the dress was black also. You can see every bump and dives.


In the picture, my sister is wearing the dress. She is 5' and just under 100 pounds. Fits and looks much better on her (I am 5'2" 115lbs). She does need to get it shortened about 3 inches though.


Love this dress!


What a great dress, and price. My daughter is going to homecoming in this with a Disney theme she will be Minnie Mouse. Excellent.


Stylish... And superb. Quality....
