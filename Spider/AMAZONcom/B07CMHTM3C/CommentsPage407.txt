this dress is a bit shorter than other Anni Coco dresses I've purchased. While still long, it comes well above the knee - something that vintage style dresses typically do not. It is well made, with cups sewn into the top (the other styles I own do not have this) which I thought was a nice touch. Overall I am pleased with this dress. Note: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.


Great dress overall!  The seaming doesnt quite fit my body in the right places, the belt loops are a little lower than my actual waistline but its super cute and appropriate to wear to work which is why I bought it :)  I did recieve this dress at a discounted price for my honest review.

Fits perfectly:) its very beautiful! My husband loves it on me, only thing is that its a little thin so your body shows but its ok with me:) its a long pretty dress that if your short get your high hells and its so beautiful!!! Love love love it!!!! Thank you so much. Wore this on our dinner date with hubby:)


lovely dress! no adjustments were needed! i ordered an xs as i am 5ft 6 and 102lbs...would definitely recommend to anyone!


I really - REALLY like this dress.  Unfortunately, as I am 6' tall, it is truly too short for me.  Height is a blessing and a curse.


I enjoy the style of the 50's and this is a perfect take on the past.  A little tight to be a large but it is a cute dress and the quality is good for the price.. It will be a new favorite for me.


A very cute dress. Usually I'm a medium, based on reviews I ordered a Large and it fits perfectly. The cut is very flattering, cinched at the waist but doesn't make me look like I'm pregnant. Personally I don't like the big bow belt, I wear it without. Might get a thin black belt instead.


Very retro fell like a million bucks in it


Like it more than ever fits well lays well
