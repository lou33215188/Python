Great dress, good quality. Just too long for me.


I wear a 10 and biased on other reviews I ordered  and extra-large it fit perfectly.  Washed it and the colors bleed very bad. Can not wear it anymore.


It was made good, but the dress looked different online. I thought the poke a dotes were smaller.


I love the dress. Being a bigger person the dress fit great and covered my problem areas


Love the dress.  I am glad that I bought the size up! It seems to run small in the bust, but is acceptable. I will probably order another one in red.


Such a flattering and classic cut dress. Fabric is a little stiff but with a wash or two it should be fine. I will FORSURE order more in different colors and patterns!


Love this dress so much my sister and I both have one.


Sizes on various products differ, they are not consistent at all.  Had to return for refund.


Great dress and fits well.


Cute dress in the pix but it doesn't fit very well.  The back is very stretchy so get a smaller size.  I'm going to have to take it in.
