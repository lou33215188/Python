awesome dress


Couldn't be happier with this purchase. Just after trying it on, I just loved the fit!


Just as pictured. Loved it!


Cutest dress I ever wore! Got lots of compliments:)


Worked great for a themed party.


❤️❤️❤️Loved it.


I'm normally a size 12/14 and I buy my dresses in a large/extra large (I've got a size d/dd chest 41 inches), but since I was buying this online I did not want to get a dress that was too small and would rather be safe than sorry. When I got it the top was actually too large for me, since there is quite a bit of stretch in that area. With this dress I would recommend just buying the size you normally wear. Since it was too big, tt was also a bit long.


Considering the dress quality and appearance I'd still have to give it five stars. I got so many compliments on this outfit when I wore it and it has to be one of my favorite dresses ever. considering that i got it for under 25 dollars I'm beyond trilled. Thank you!


Opened the package and was amazed by the quality. Much more than just a jersey maxi dress and a score for the price.


I wasn't satisfied with the dress it was longer then expected.. Dress was delivered later then promised.
