This is a CLASSIC DRESS!!  Very pretty.  Great material!!


Very pretty and flattering on.  I love it


I love this dress!  I wish there was a little more stretch fabric, so you don't need the zippe, but it's really a beautiful dress!!


This great looking dress on the body. I loved the dress so much I ordered to more colors because its great simple but sexy look. Thanks


So cute! and the material is better than I expected. Seems like it will last for a while. I absolutely love it.


Very pretty dress.


Fabric is thick and has a little stretch.


Not for busty women.


Such a cute dress! Got so many compliments when I wore it! Make sure to buy a petticoat if you want it to flare out like in the picture! Definitely would buy again in another color!


This is not a truly white dress as pictured. I needed a STARK WHITE dress for the event I bought this for. It is cute and cheap so I'll keep....but its not white.


its a really nice dress made well and looks nice on
