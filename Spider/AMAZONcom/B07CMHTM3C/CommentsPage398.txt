This dress is absolutely adorable! It s so flattering on me and the material is very light weight! The yellow color is always very beautiful! I have always wanted to try a more retro look to spice up my style but all the other dresses like this were too expensive! This was an amazing product, an amazing fit, and an amazing price! I purchased the medium and it fits great! I received a discount in exchange for my honest review!


This is a cute and comfortable fitting dress.  The material is thick and the seams are sturdy and well done.  It was delivered in a short time considering it shipped from China.  The style of this dress is timeless and flattering for most if not all body types.  It can be dressed up or down depending on your prefrence or mood.  It fit as expected, I usually wear an 8 so I ordered a medium,  I worried that it might be too small when reading the other reviews, but it was perfect.  I don't have a large chest, so I'd consider sizing up if this is an issue for you as this fit me perfect.  I typically wear a size 34 B.  I plan to wear this dress often this summer.  I recieved this dress at a discount in exchange for my honest review.


This dress is super cute. Well made and has nice stitching. There is no inner lining. The fit is perfect. I'm 5'6 120lbs slender build with a small bust. I purchased a medium which fit perfect. The only reason for the four stars is the length. it hits well above the knees. When my hands are at my sides it hits at my fingertips. Too short for me being in my mid thirties with two small kiddos. If the dress was knee length I would be keeping. the color is exactly like the picture. I have to return only because of the length. This came well packaged and shipped fast. the returns are super simple. thank for the wonderful customer service. I was fortunate enough to receive this a slight discount in exchange for my true, fair, and honest opinion.


I honestly was not expecting much, as I got this dress for such a low price. I was wrong!! It is a nice sturdy weight fabric with just enough stretch to work for various body types, and is well made, the stitching is firm and not misaligned or loose anywhere, the fit was perfect (make sure you know your measurements and then compare to the size chart!!!) The bust is a perfect fit (which, is usually not) and overall I really do love this dress. I'll be buying more in the future. Online dress shopping can be so hit or miss, but this was definitely a hit!

i am actually really bummed about this product


i was beyond excited


the color is wonderful


the material is great


yet it runs about 2 sizes 2 small.


The top of the dress fit great and it was a nice fit. Unfortunately the bottom was shorter than I expected. At 5'6 I wasn't comfortable with the length of this dress and will be returning. It was mid thigh length and not longer where I would be more comfortable.  I am not sure if a bigger size would help with length. The color is great and a dark yellow than I was thinking.

I am a clothes fanatic so I was super excited to have the opportunity to purchase Anni Cocoï¿½ Women's Classy Halter Black White Striped Party Evening Maxi Dresse at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. When I opened the package I was delighted to see that it looked exactly as it was pictured. The ,aterial did not feel cheel or flimsy. it felt durable. I tried the dress on and to my delight it fit as expected, not too big or small. The material is thick enough to be work with a jacket in the fall or alone in the summer. I wold definitely recommend it to others.


**I received this item for a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review**  Below is my review of this item:


*The packaging was nice and sealed tightly.


*Upon opening the dress, I noted that the material was nice and thick, not at all thin.  The dress is rather long, and may need to be hemmed if you are petite.


*The straps look more like bra straps, and are adjustable as such.


*There were a few loose threads hanging that needed to be clipped, but that was no problem.


*Great quality, good price!


Dress was made well but I found the zipper placement odd. The zipper is under the arm but does not open the dress all the way. The beginning of the zipper starts about an inch from the top so it really makes a hole rather than unzip the dress. Very odd and not useful as zippers should be. The zipper also was difficult to open and close and I doubt it would last very long.


It does run small, I normally wear a large and the medium was a decent fit.


My problem is the dress fit oddly on my body type. That and the weird zipper prompted me to return the dress. Too bad as it is cute!

I absolutely love this dress. I purchased it to go out to a very nice restaraunt for date night with my husband. I got compliments from my mom, hubby, and sister when trying it on. The fit is great and true to size. It is well made and made out of a great, comfortable fabric. The only thing I wish was diffent is that it had a liner to prevent being able to see under garments and through the white. However, that's an easy fix with a slip. I would definitely recommend that you add this to your wardrobe.
