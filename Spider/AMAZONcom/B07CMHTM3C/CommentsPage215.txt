A beautiful, well made dress. I feel like Marilyn Monroe wearing it!


True to size perfect fit


Love it so much! I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly! I'm 196, 5'2, and have huge chest and butt and I absolutely adore it. I was even shocked by the quality fabric(: wearing it to Disney as Minnie Mouse


Absolutely adorable dress. I got it for my daughter and the small fit perfectly.  She loves the dress and so do I.


Fits exactly like I thought it would. I love the stretchy material especially for those times I go to dinner and need a little extra room coming home.


Fits great! A little bit in the chest area which is surprising but it's nothing I can't alter quickly. I am 5'2", 145lbs and I ordered an XL. Fits great, good length.


Liked style and quality of dress but just too small on top.


It looked just like the picture but you can feel the cheap fabric. Not to mention the dress was a lot longer than I was expecting! Over all it's nice enough and you get what you pay for. A few alterations and it will work just fine!


I can't Wait For spring to wear this


Cheap fabric, poor fit
