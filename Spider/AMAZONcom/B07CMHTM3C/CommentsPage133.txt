I love this dress. Its a great fabric. I hope they get more dresses like this for me to buy. Its perfect.


This dress is easy to wear, washes great! IF the dress fits you perfectly, like mine does, consider drying for long enough to remove the wrinkls and hang.  I am 5'5" with ZERO bust and weigh 150'ish.  The large fits me perfect.  Its a GREAT VALUE!


The waist on this dress came about 5" above my waist.


The bodice has elastic in the back ..... it constantly slid down my back.


The fabric is gorgeous however and I did appreciate that the hem went to just below my knee.


LOVE this dress. I am 5'6", 175 pounds and Bra 36 D. It fits great and just hits the ground. The zipper seemed a little "catchy" but I don't care for the price and how well it hides my tummy!


My daughter wore to her bridal shower and it looked amazing on her. It was a last minute purchase and it worked out yaay for us.


AAA+++


Bought a medium for our niece. Site said it fit a little big.


Very cute, comfy dress. The only thing that I didn't care for was that there was a small zipper underneath one of the armpits of the dress, instead of in the back, which was weird for me. Other than that, it was great!


LOVE IT!! It's perfect, fits as expected. The blue is very rich and goes well on pale people like myself.


Love love love this dress!! The color was brighter than expected, but still love it. I got an XL because the sizing is small. The sleeves are not small fitting, and I do have room in the busy area of the dress.


This is for my daughter who is 31 and loves fashion from the 40's, 50's and early 60's. her younger sister is wrapping it for me but is sure she is going to love it.
