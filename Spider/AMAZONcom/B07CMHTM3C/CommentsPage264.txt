Gorgeous dress, absolutely loved how it looked!


I'm 5' 3", 135lbs and a 36C. The medium fit perfectly but was a bit longer than I liked (around mid calf). The dress was pretty easy to hem so that wasn't a big deal. Overall 5/5.


1st thing... BUY THIS DRESS!!  Dress fit amazingly!!  The dress was made well, the material was much better than I expected.  I will be ordering more!!


Great quality for the price and fits great Dress is  also nice if you've got a little belly like me, hides it! Hehe


Fit perfect except the boob part was a little tight. But I will make it work.


Good quality. Not super seethrough even though its white. I had to buy to fit mu chest though so the waist and back is a bit big. I sew though so I can do it myself. I AM SO EXCITED TO WEAR IT!


I wore this to my bridal shower and it was gorgeous! I purchased mine in white so I definitely needed to wear a slip with it, but the fit was great and I felt so beautiful wearing it. I am buying it in different colors!


I think it runs large. I'm 5'6 150 and M was a good fit but more room then I expected. I love the dress. Great price as well.


Sad to have to send this back, super cute in person. I ordered my normal size and it was just too small in the bust area. So sad but otherwise it was a great dress.


Fits perfect and very comfortable with elastic/stretch back. Nice thick fabric.
