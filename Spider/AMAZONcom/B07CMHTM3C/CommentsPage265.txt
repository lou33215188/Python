Zipper broke immediately and the dress practically ripped in half. Don't waste your money o. This incredibly cheap product!!!!


very comfortable


good quality fabric I am 5'4 160 bust 36-b the dress complimented my figure nicely I add the petticoat and that kicked it up a notch. I will  order again


Fits great!  This dress is darling :)


Had to order a small, that medium was too big. The small was perfect, just a little long. Nice material.


This dress fits as expected.  I used the manufacturer's measurements and this dress fits just right.


I do not like the dress at  all, I feel it fits me very poorly the dress displayed looks to be cut differently that's the one i received.


Perfect fit! And the colors were just as vibrant in person as they were in the photos!


Fit as expected. I ordered a 2x, which is what I normally order 2x when buying online and it fits great!


Material is heavy yet has a little stretch.  Super comfortable, yet classy addition to my collection.
