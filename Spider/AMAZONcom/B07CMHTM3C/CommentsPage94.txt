Great material, has a slight stretch to it and fits great.


I love the  stretch in the material and it fits perfect but would like it a bit longer but beautiful  dress.


Tthis dress was a really pretty dress. It fits perfectly. Loved the  orange color. I just didn't the collar of the dress on me. I debating whether to return it because it a great dress.


Well, since I got a second reminder to complete a review on  this dress I think they really want reviews ;). That being said, I bought this dress for myself as one of my birthday presents and I really like it. I had gotten compliments when I wear it out.


I LOVE this dress!!! The reviews were very helpful before I bought. I normally wear a small, I'm 5'4 117.. I bought medium..prob could have bought the small..but I worry about the bust being tight so went with medium...fits great loose in waist and not tight in bust. The heart buttons are a plus...the length is wonderful...hard to find modest dresses .. This one is definitely worth it...the price, the material, the fit, looks and feels like an expensive dress...did I mention I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚


The buttons make this a great dress for breastfeeding and the flared skirt actually still looks good on a postpartum belly--a rare find!!


Far beyond my expectations! This dress is beautiful and well made. One of my top 5 Amazon purchases... and I have bought sooooo much, haha!


Love it! The skirt portion is a full hoop skirt, long enough to ware without leggings in the summer (even with me being 5'10")- I have bigger arms so my only downside is a slight tightness in the shoulders.


Looks Very Very Cute on. Its well made and nice fabric. I've enjoyed wearing it to church and looking like a 1950's house wife is a plus.


i ordered a x-large,even though i wear a med-lrg,for bust reasons.fit great.even a little extra room in the waist,so order a size up is my suggestion,but it is beautiful
