Perfect, perfect, perfect! Just came today and when I pulled it out the bag, I thought "uh oh, might be too big". Nope, it wasn't. I bought a Large and it is a perfect fit!


Great fit, lightweight, exactly as described!


I am actually very impressed with this dress. Good quality and great look ESPECIALLY for the price! I ordered 3 of these for the female ushers in my wedding, and these will be a very classy edition. I actually want to order one for myself just to wear to brunch one day!


Received the dress today....excellent quality...fits well....dress is well made...wearing it for a birthday party....


The color... the quality and the fit was spot on. Best of all it was very affordable. Compared to the vintage stores in the mall this was a steal!!!


This was super cute, but I had to return it because it was too small.  I always buy this size, but it was wayyyy too small.


The dress fit me perfect in most area except it is a little loose on the waist. Rather than that the dress is beautiful.


I ordered several sizes so that I could get the right one.  I kept the solid red, solid black, and red with white polka dots. I have worn the solid black in public and strangers were telling me how beautiful the dress it.  It is very flattering to big but girls!


Thick and rough material, much longer and larger than expected, overall ugly looking, unflattering, colour darker than shown,etc. Did not like it at all. Thoroughly disappointed.


Super cute dress I wear a size 8 in the medium fits perfect
