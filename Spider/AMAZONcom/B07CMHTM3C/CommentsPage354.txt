The dress is too long


As advertised


This dress is one of my very favorite dresses! I am 5â€™3â€� and 120 lbs and I ordered small and it fits perfectly. When I tried this dress for the first time I struggled to get in and out of the dress so I was disappointed that I needed help with it. The fabric is not elastic. So i checked the reviews on this dress and found out a lot of people struggled in the same way. Then I found a zipper on the side of the dress!  I was so happy that I put this dress on and took it off several times for fun. I love this dress even more after finding the zipper. Itâ€™s modest but a very stylish dress. I absolutely adore this dress!


The dress was perfect for my son's birthday party!


Love it. Fit well and fabric is nice
