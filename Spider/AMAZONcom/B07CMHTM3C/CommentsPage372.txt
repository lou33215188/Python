Love it...


Love this dress! Great purchase.


Like my dress. Extra fast shipping.


Zipper keeps getting stuck.


Item is perfect


Wrinkles badly to the point that you really can't wear it without extensive ironing. Need to iron out of package to wear first time. I sized up too much and it's too large but I kept it anyways out of laziness. I've only worn it once and it was too large and now it's in my closet looking old and wrinkly after one cold wash. Color doesn't seem to hold well washing either.


Beautiful dress


The dress is beautiful but it runs small. If you're a big busted lady this is not for you if you're ordering the 2xl. The dress zips along the side of the left bust which makes it harder to fit.


Love it!!


Very sexy and comfortable.
