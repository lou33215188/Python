The dress is cute with great length and as a bonus the fabric was of excellent quality.


I'm 5'4, 36C bust, 28 waist, and roughly 140 lbs and I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly! I wore it for my birthday and I am very happy with my purchase. Would order it again!


I simply love this dress. It fits like a dream. I am 5ft 3 and it is a few centimeters long but that is hardly a problem.


Top was a little large for my small chested daughter.  Small alterations fixed that.  Fortunately, I can sew.


This dress fits perfect. I love how it enhanced my shirt without highlighting my tummy area. The dress fits comfortable, and looked great with my heels.


Not at all pretty.  Cheapy. Little appeal


True to size, good quality , fast shipping


The dress in fine, but it is a bit large for me. It makes my shoulders wider. Also the waist line is not on the place. I'm 5'8, and the dress waist line is higher than it should be.


Otherwise, it is a nice well-made dress.


Perfect dress. Very flattering!


The dress is so pretty . It fits perfectly .
