Actually ordered this twice, because I found the generic sizing chart to be rather unhelpful. I originally ordered a size large, which fit slightly better than a sack. Sent it back with the intention of ordering a medium to replace it, but since they didn't have any in the color I wanted, decided to try a small.


Tried it on expecting to be disappointed again, only to have it fit me rather well. It's a great, cute summer dress. I've been wearing it with a strapless bra and the back is just high enough to cover the band well.


For reference: 5'4", 145lbs, 35" bust, ~30" waist


Side note: Didn't see any care instructions on the tag; have washed on delicate cycle and air dried and that seemed to be fine.


Product is as described


Suck


Good. Basic but nice. Feel free to buy.


wow!  perfect!


The bust area was way too big compared to the rest of it. Going to have to get that part tailored but the rest fit fine.


I love this dress! I will buy more!


Love the style


This dress is absolutely a dream! I got many compliments the first day I wore it!


I really like the dress, good quality material.  I'm 5'4", 131 lbs and the Medium fit perfectly.
