Very beautiful dress it's fits me very well thanks guys


Love it! Size is very accurate!


It is the perfect dress for my Alice in Wonderland costume. And will be a great great addition to my closet.


Not a good fit


This is a nice dress.  Fabric seams to be of good quality.  Nice simple vintage design.  Elastic in the back is good for the fit.  It does run a bit large.


Perfect!! Exactly what I was looking for well put together


Very sexy dress. I love weight of it because the way it makes the dress hang is classy and sexy.


Arrived on time and I love it! Thank you


By the way I just ordered the red and black polka dots both for my 50th birthday! Just received my other today, beautiful! ğŸ˜�


Beautiful, but a little long. I'm getting mine hemmed.


Love this dress..
