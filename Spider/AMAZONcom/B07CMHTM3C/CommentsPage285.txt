Great quality. Love this dress!


lovely


It was a gift for my sister! SHE LOVES IT!


Very happy with this dress fits perfectly and the length was great


Fits perfect. Love this dress. Will be buying more.


Dress was super cute, I wore it for Halloween.  Iâ€™m a size 12 and the xl was the perfect fit.


Very cute color, fit perfectly..true to size.  Cute style but too short for my build.  I was hoping for something at the knee.  I'm 5'6" and it fell mid thigh.


Fits great. Good material. Didnt send belt.


My 16 year old daughter loves vintage clothes.  She was head over heels when it arrived.  All we need to do now is buy a slip so it flows out


Beautiful
