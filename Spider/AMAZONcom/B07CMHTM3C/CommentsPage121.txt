This dress is gorgeous! I wore it to my husband's work Christmas party and then again to my oldest son's orchestra concert. Everyone loves it, so many compliments.


Absolutely beautiful! My oldest daughter wore it with a sweater over top and it was gorgeous with a vintage feel and she said she was comfortable as well.


Beautiful dress! I am 5'3" and around 195 lbs and this size fit me perfectly. I am definitely thinking about buying different colors.


I gave it to my cousin who is nearly 6'. That is the only way this dress would look nice -that or if I strapped stilts to my 5'2 frame.


The color we ordered was white, the dress we received was ivory. The material was very low quality and felt like a low end bed sheet rather than a dress.


Great dress especially with a petticoat.


Fits perfectly.


Its not exactly what I expected.  Its ok, but a little small as well.


Bought for a theme party. Fits great , went off the size chart to order. Love the color. Delivery was very fast.


Cute style, good price, but way too big around the waste. I am 5 foot 6 and weigh 120 pounds. I purchased a small and it is way too big.


I waited a while for this one. I think over all it's a good product. For me there's a bit of gapping on the upper ribs/sides that would look better more fitted, but it can be altered.
