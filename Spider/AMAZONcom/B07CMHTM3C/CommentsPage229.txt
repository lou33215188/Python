Loves it


This fits perfect the neckline is a bit higher than i thought it would be but it fits well. The patern or ruching on the chest is a bit odd buts its not bad it could possibly be ironed out.


This dress looks great on.  Bought a couple of sizes up.


Bought for a 50's Sock Hop.  It fit perfect.


dress does not reach top of ankle.  but does look as picture except for the length


I bought the dress for a 50's production I'm in.  I bought a size bigger than normal and it was still a bit too small in the chest.  However, I do love the dress and have gotten many compliments on it.


It's beautiful well worth it


Rubs small


The quality was better than I expected. I bought a Medium I'm 5'6  141 pounds 38D it's a little big in the elastic in the back,.  Nice full coverage in bust area. Can't wait to wear it!


Beautifully made. Quick Shipment and returns. Unfortunately my daughter changed her mind.
