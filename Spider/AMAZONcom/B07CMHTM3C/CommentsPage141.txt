I love this dress! The 2x fit perfectly. I am size 22-24. I will order more colors


Not made with the best of materials, but a nice fit and perfect for what I needed.


Family complimented me on the fact it was very flattering and feminine. I bought it and truthfully it is outside of my comfort zone. But it is so cute...can't wait to wear it.


I bout this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loves it and wore it immediately. If you put a petticoat under it, it gets the perfect amount of fluff. It fits great and is made of quality material that isn't too thin or flimsy


Very cheap material.


I like the dress but the bust was to small. I can still wear it but would love a bigger top. Also it arrived wrinkled. All in all very cute for the price!


Didn't like the material


Nice good material.  Give hold on your body. Flattering.


Fits very good! And for the small price I paid for it, I was the hit of the party! I love it! I am 150 lbs and 5'9". The medium fits me well.


cheaply made see through fabric don't waste ur money
