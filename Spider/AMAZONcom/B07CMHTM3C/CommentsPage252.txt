The dress is nice but not true to size.  Fits like a medium.


This dress is amazing and I love everything about it. This is the second one I bought, but this vendor sizing and material was much better.


The dress is really pretty and comfortable. The material is cotton and cool, needs to be ironed though, but I love the material which is not see through. The fit is perfect. I ordered L, I am 5.2 and weight 143 l, pear shaped and L fits perfect.


Love the fit


I got this dress to wear at our reception and it fit perfectly! It was exactly what I wanted and looked just like the photo. What a great deal too!


The dress fits like a t but, the dress I received in the mail wasn't what I was expecting. There was no bow to tie around my waist.


This was a gift and she loved it


Super comfortable. Fits great


Gave it to my little cousin.  Way too small and I'm not a big girl.


Good quality. I wore as my Halloween costume, fit amazing. Well worth the money. Runs true to size and washed in the washer well
