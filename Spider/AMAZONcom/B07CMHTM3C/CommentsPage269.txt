Fits great!


This is a beautiful, high quality dress and fits amazingly well.  I am extremely pleased with the color, comfort, fit, and texture of the dress.  Thank you!


I love the color and fit! I'm 5'3", 110 lbs and got a size S and fit perfectly!


Love the lightweight fabric and it fits very well! The sizes run a little big from what I typically buy as far as S/M/L, but if you go by the numbered dress size in the chart, you should be accurate.


Such a cute dress, fits perfectly, and I find it flattering. I can't wait to wear it!


This dress is beautiful. It fits in all the right places, very flattering. The chest is cut abut higher than the picture shows. But otherwise perfect
