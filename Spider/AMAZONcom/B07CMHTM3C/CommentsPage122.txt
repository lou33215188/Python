My daughter loved it. Fit her perfecrly!


This dress fit perfect! I am 5 ft 130lbs and 38 bust. I got a large. Length falls about 3 inches below my knee. The first time I wore it I got a compliment. I ordered the grey with black trim. I highly recommend.


This is the first time I've taken a chance ordering a really inexpensive dress online. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the soft, stretchy fabric. It did run bigger than I expected - I'm 5' 5", about 130 lbs, 34 A, and the small is actually a bit large. I was still able to wear it comfortably; I just might hem it, and I have to make sure I tie the halter snuggly. If they had an extra small, I'd probably order it in every color! :)


my wife loves it.


I love this dress so much! I got tons of compliments the first day I wore it. Very flattering fit. I am 5'5" , 127 lbs, small chest and the small looks great on me. I plan to buy more of these!


Super cute. It's a stretchy material but thick. Not worried about it ripping or tearing. It was just a little too snug for me. I should've went w my first


Instinct and got one size larger.


I absolutely love this dress, it fits well and looks spectacular!  I've gotten several compliments on it.


Absolutely adorable dress! I'm 5'11" and 170# (31" waist, 39" bust), and the large was just a little too big. I'll be exchanging it for a medium.


So I have this exact same dress from a different seller.  This one.....just doesn't compare.  Its just not as good of a quality.  Its good because it fits as it should.


I just didn't like it.  It's good for everyday wear, but the quality is not good enough for a party dress.
