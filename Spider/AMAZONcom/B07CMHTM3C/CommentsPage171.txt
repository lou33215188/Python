Nice material.  Fits nicely but a little loose around the waist


I LOVE this dress. It a fun vintage style dress and the material is great with the % of spandex in it. Great style, would buy again


The dress was much bigger than anticipated and the fabric was pretty rough and crinkly. As a shorter person, this dress was far too long and basically "swallowed" me.


I was very surprised at how flattering and the material for for the price. I don't think you will be disappointed. I am not skinny and it seems to flatter in the right areas.


Just a little snug in the armpit area other than that it is absolutely perfect


Great for halloween.  It fit, but was a little long, i am 5'5.


cute, not see through at all! definitely going down a size!


So many compliments and its comfortable even on my "I feel fat days"


It was cute - but felt very raincoat - material.  Not exactly comfortable, so I am unfortunately returning it.


Lovely cut & good cotton material, but cut a little small for the size listed.
