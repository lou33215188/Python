all good-very nice1


Hides my love handles and is very flattering. The fit and color are exactly as I hoped.


More than perfect


Bought this dress for a weekend away.  Thought it would be nice to have something new to wear to dinner.  Great fit.  I love the purple.  Can't wait to wear it again.


Absolutely one of the best purchases I've made (and there have been many!) Fits like a dream, super comfortable and looks adorable on! Highly recommend!


Super awesome quality - great length! Had heels and still long enough. Adjustable shoulder straps


The dress is great and I look good in it too, it's a little tight on my bust area. Still great dress


5'9, 150lbs, ordered XL. Fits perfectly! I love this dress, very nicely made and I received many compliments.


sent it back. material was thin! Not cute


Its beautiful! Great fabric. love the way it fits :)
