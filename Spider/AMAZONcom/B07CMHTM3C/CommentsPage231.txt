My 15 year old is less than 5 ft tall so had to hem this.  Washes great and looks fabulous.


Soft material


This dress is so cute and comfortable.  I love the quality and color if the fabric.  You can't go wrong with this dress.


Looks amazing and for the price I couldn't have asked for a better dress for a 50's costume party.


fit as expected. the color was brighter than I expected but it's a good look. it 's really cute when I wear it and I might get another dress in a different color.


Came on time and fit perfectly! I am very happy with this purchase and the quality of the dress was good too. I will probably purchase more of these in the future.
