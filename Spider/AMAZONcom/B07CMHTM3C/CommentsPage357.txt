i was hesitant to purchase this dress because of the negative reviews it received - but I'm glad I purchased it! Fits perfectly ❤️


Sizes are bigger than outfit


very nice...as expected


Great material not only would get to wear it on my daughter bday party !


Nice dress, material is a little thin but still very pretty


Very nice!  The top was a little large for me.  The rest fit fine.


I can't wear this dress even with high heels, very long. Almost 4 inches on the floor.


It was exactly what I wanted


Brautuful


This dress is so beautiful not too expensive and a great quality fabric almost formal like!
