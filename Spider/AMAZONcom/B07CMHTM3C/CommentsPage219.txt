Super cute...just too big


IT fits perfect, the material is fantastic... I only wish it had packets but other then that ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


It's fits perfectly! I'm satisfied!


Great quality, fits perfect! I'm 5,6" tall and "long maxi dresses" are usually never long enough, but this is perfect! (Also adjustable)


I was very impressed with this dress.  However, it is a little shorter than I expected.  At 5'10" it is definitely above the knee in the "possibly too short to wear to work as a kindergarten teacher" category.


Fits great looks good but wish it was a softer material.


Cute and comfy.


The medium fit good!


The color is gorgeous. It's a timeless dress absolutely love it


Elastic back causes dress to be too big. Returned all 3 I purchased because dress offers no support. I'm a 5'0 and 114 lbs and couldn't get the dresses to stay on place
