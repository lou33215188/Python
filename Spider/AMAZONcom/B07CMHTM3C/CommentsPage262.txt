Love it! I originally ordered a large for fear it would be too small but wound up returning it for my real size, which is a medium.  Can't wait to wear it this summer!


Love the fabric and the feel of it. Not too heavy but very durable and bouncy. Perfect lines. Made very well. I'll def be shopping from this store again.


Really nice dress but about 6 inches too long.


Very cute and nice for the price. Good fit.  Does require some touch-up ironing, and one button fell off first wearing. Nice stretch to the fabric. Glad we bought it.


Tight around the waste. Should have bought a large.


I bought this dress for my mom, and she loved it, The only issue was that the buttons didn't close and we followed the measurments that were included. She'll have to wear something udner it to be able to wear it, but everything else fit perfect on her.


Beautiful! fits well. I was afraid it would be too "poofy" at the bottom, but it lays well, until you spin :) Great "party dress"


Usually my daughter wears a medium. Just make sure you follow the size chart. This product is definitely worth the money. Easy to iron.


I really like this dress however, I had to give 4 stars because it shrunk after the first wash & dry, now I have to wear pants underneath.


Loved this dress! Fit as expected. The only thing that bothered me was that the back of it folded down.
