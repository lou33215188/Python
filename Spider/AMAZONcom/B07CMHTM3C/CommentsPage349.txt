I love this 50s look.  It fits perfectly.  I will be shopping Anni Coco again.  Thank you.


The back is a little to big. But I would still recommend.


I love the dress but it was just a little some around my hips.


It's a great summer dress!


This dress is very flattering.


I am a very true medium and the medium was too large for me. The zipped gets stuck and does go down farther than you'd expect. I have a very hard time getting it off but it's easy putting it on so I won't be wearing it for anything short of a day. I'm a 32D and the cups on it sort of fit weird but they do fit none the less, however the band sags more than I like since I would be wearing a strapless bra with it. It comes down past my knees incase you are wondering on the length and I am 5'5. Over all I enjoy the dress though.


Beautiful in person love it!


Adorable dress and really well made considering the price.


Cute dress, a bit long for me, but I am short..very nice overall


love this dress...I feel like a movie star when I wear it.
