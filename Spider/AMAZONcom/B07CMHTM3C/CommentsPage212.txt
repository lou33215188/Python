Love this dress . fits perfect


The fit was as expected I am a big girl 5 9in  and weighs 170 lbs and it was long enough and fits however material was not the best


Love my dress. It fits and looks wonderful on me. I am 5ft. And not many dresses fit me well. Thank you.


Loved the dress just to big and i think the xs would be to small


she love it so much she"s wearing it on her Graduation day on this thursday.


Not as nice as in the pic. Returned it.


The skirt is slightly see through, but I had also purchased a petticoat to wear with it, so its not a problem. But would definitely need to wear a slip or something underneath if i didn't want the color of my underwear to show through!


Love this dress! Will be getting more colors.


Fits, which for me is unusual!!


My sister loves this dress I bought it for her for my wedding and its amazing
