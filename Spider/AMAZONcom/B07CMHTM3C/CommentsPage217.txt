Beautiful.


Purchased it for my DW for a "Dapper Day" at Walt Disney World. She ordered a medium (she is 5'4", 130, 36DD) and it fit perfectly. Very pleased with the quality of the material and the quick delivery.


Love it! It's gorgeous! Might be a little bigger then expected in the back/chest or it could just be my oddly shaped body and a size smaller probably would be too small but it's perfect and I love it!


I love the fun pattern of this dress, but it was far too short.  I ended up not wearing it to the function I bought it for.


Love this dress. Very comfortable, fits perfectly.


Bought this for my wife for Disney's Dapper Day next month and she loves it. fit's great and for the price is an excellent value.


Very cute dress!
