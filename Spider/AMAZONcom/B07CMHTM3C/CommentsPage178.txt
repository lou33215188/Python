Great material for the price as well as Marilyn Monroe sexy.


I really like this dress. I am planning to use this for Dapper Day. I usually wear a small or medium size. I got a small one and fit just as expected.


Cute dress!!! I ordered a size up and it works well!


Cute, good material but just felt like it wasn't my style.


The dress is too short for me - I'm 5'9". Returned it.


I don't know why I received an extra LARGE one, I should have order extra Small one


Great dress for the price! I left off the last star only because I got white and you can see right thru it! Not just the skirt part but the top as well. Def. cant go braless in the white! Lol


So glad I found this dress!! The material is slightly stretchy and fits as expected. Great price for the quality of the material and style.


It's such a cute cut. The dress fits well! I love the little unique charm like the buttons and the belt. I got a petticoat to put under it. Fabulous!!


5'9", 140 pounds, 36B and I ordered a medium. Fits perfectly!


Love this dress. Nice material but as a bigger woman it was too snug in the waist.
