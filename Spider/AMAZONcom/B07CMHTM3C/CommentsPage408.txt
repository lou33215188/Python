It was too big only because the smallest size they had was a small, not extra small. But I had it altered so I could still wear it to the 50s party. The material is great, and it came in the mail 2 days later. I love it!


I loved this dress when I saw it online. I got the largest size just in case, and it still did not fit. And it was insanely short. I will probably have to alter it to be able to wear it at all. On the other hand, I love the fabric and the colors. The print on it is beautiful! The shape of the dress is very flattering. I just can't say more because it didn't fit. I received this product at a slight discount in return for an honest review.

I love this dress! I have purchased 4 Anne Coco dresses and I love them all. They are sewn well, and with quality material. They look great with or without a petticoat.


It was a present for daughter, she loves it & says it fit well for the size I ordered.


LOVE IT -LOVE IT- LOVE IT!!!! Great Quality-Great Color-Great Fit- got it in an XL.. fits to size chart.


Very cute dress! Fit perfectly. I'm a size 16 and I got the xxl. I could have also fit the xl but decided to go with the xxl for a little extra room.
