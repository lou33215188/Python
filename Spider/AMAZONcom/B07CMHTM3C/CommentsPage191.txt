I was very pleasantly surprised by this dress.  It arrived quickly and fit perfectly which is not always easy to do when you are nearly 6 ft tall.  Washed great and hadn't required ironing.


awesome it really is comfortable


Super cute, Super 50's


I love this dress! It fits well. It has stretchy material which is a plus. I'm 4"11 150lbs, and I got a medium.


Good fitting and good equality.  My daughter loves it.


Very bad material and horrible stitching


It's nice, but not quite as elegant as in the picture. The back is also very revealing, which I'm not crazy about. It runs small, so be careful.


Nice product  good fit cant wait to wear it


The dress came withouth the belt. It shows on the picture where I ordered it that it has a belt, red and white. I was supposed to used this dress on november 4. Now its not worth it. Very dissapointed.


This dress fits perfect. The size chart is spot on. It is well made and comfortable. Thank you!
