When I received this dress It was in a nice clear sleeve. I pulled it out and the material feels similar to those nice court shorts your husband might wear to work.  I put this dress on and its a thicker material (not a hot material) so it hides the little imperfections you might have with other dresses.  Absolutely not see threw (ive had that issue with other dresses Ive purchased) which is great!!!!


I love the buttons!! They are a very nice sexy/ elegant button.  What I absolutely love is that the bow, strap around the stomach is just like a high end material belt ( same as the dress).  It isnt attached so if you dont care for the bow then you dont have to wear it.  Im seriously ordering 2 more of the dresses.


As for size I am about 5'9 and 153lbs with a C bust and the large fit me perfect.  I am always a small to medium but after reading other reviews I ordered the large and its perfect! A medium wouldve been tight.


I love how it buttons all the way down so I could wear a white tank top under it and unbutton it completely!! You can wear it different ways!!


Fits very well.  I'm 5'3" and about 130lbs and I chose a small in the Navy Blue.  It's a bit stretchy but doesn't look it which probably helps too.  I think it's really cute.  I feel little bit younger in it.  I'm not sold on the heart buttons but they're okay.  I have a violet petticoat that I think looks really nice under it too.  My petticoat has a weird almost shelf in it that looks weird in some dresses but in this dress it's totally unnoticeable.  I read somewhere that every skin tone looks good in Navy, I hope that is true.  It's a pretty navy color too, it's not too dark so it doesn't look black at all.  It's definitely blue.


So happy with this purchase!! I was looking for something cute and flirty for a dinner cruise coming up, and this fit the bill! I'm a size 6, but looked at reviews and went with the small, and so glad I did . If anything , it's still loose on me . I'm 5'5 and weigh 138, for reference . 34b. Only complaint will have to have pressed, which can be expected with shipment and being cotton. About to purchase in blackğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�picture attached!!! Hope this helps ladies !!!


Had to add to my review. Once I had dress pressed , looked like a million bucks. Perfect for cruise and has so many compliments. LOVE attached another pic once pressed.


I am not into polka dots- but we went on a Disney Cruise so I wanted something Minnie Mouse ish. This dress fit so well! it held up my larger chest and flared out very flattering. Great buy! I am 5'4" 190lb and 36E I ordered an XL


This dress is *amazing*. It fits me perfectly, and it's such great quality! I will definitely order from Anni Coco again.


Edit: FYI, I ordered a Large. I am roughly a size 11, 5'6, 155lbs, and 38C.


I love the style of this dress! The neckline flatters the shoulders, the bodice is slimming and the way the skirt cascades into the stripes is also flattering! I was looking for a cute, inexpensive maxi dress for my upcoming cruise and this one's perfect. Paid $22! Material was a little thin but I didn't find it see through at all. It was stretchy enough to be fitted but not tight. However, because it's a little thin my belly button kinda shows. It's not that noticeable, but I'm picky so I'll probably wear my spanx shorts underneath. I'm 5'3" so took a chance on the length-still almost touched the floor with my platform heels on! Also ~130# and a medium fit comfortably.


IN LOVE WITH THIS DRESS. I'm 5'7, 147 lbs, wears a 36 B and 29 in pants. The medium fit me perfect! It really compliments your figure. Hides the muffin top, enchances the breast area, and slims you out. I suggest everyone to try it out. The material is light, breathable and stretchy. It doesn't cut into my back or underarms.. I love it!!!


The quality of this fabric is perfect. It is NOT a thin, cottony piece that doesn't hold any shape. The fabric itself matches the 1950s housewife feel, and I absolutely love that. As for sizing, this product DOES fit to size.


My measurements:


5'1"


118 lbs


34B


26" waist line (although I can suck it in and pretend it's even smaller)(just kidding I actually wear food pants when I eat out)


The dress reaches to the middle of my knees, which is the perfect length for my height! So any of you short girls who wanted to know how long this dress is, it's a very flattering length! When the dress came in the mail, it was very crumpled, but that's what irons are for.


If you're wondering if you need to go a size up, DON'T! This dress is VERY accurate to regular dress sizes. I honestly believe that the reviewers who thought this was too small just didn't know their waist measurements or their real dress sizes. Because I purchased a medium for this (I'm a small but the smalls were sold out), and this fit like a MEDIUM. The waist was looser, the back was looser, and I'm going to tailor those areas to my body shape. If you do have any doubts on what size to get, then go a size up, because you can always make it smaller. But if you get one smaller, you'll only end up disappointed.


CONS:


The only con I have has nothing to do with the dress itself, and it has no effect on the rating of the dress whatsoever. What happened is I ordered this dress with the same-day shipping so that it could come tomorrow, but the package got sent to another city, and ended up arriving around 5 days later. Amazon handles this very professionally. I contacted them to complain, only because I paid the extra shipping to get it immediately. The worker refunded me every single penny and gave me a $5 coupon for my next purchase. Then the dress arrived, and I ended up getting it for free. Stuff happens, I guess, and this didn't turn out to be much of a 'con' after all!


To conclude this review, I want to get this dress style in every color, as well as the other dress style. I'm obsessed. TAKE MY MONEY!


I really love this dress and would have given in 5 stars except that I thought the material was going to be stretchy all over.  The fabric is heavier and will need a good ironing once washed.  It is very flattering in fit so I'm very happy.  I purchased a large, I'm 5ft 1" and about 155 and a 38D chest wise so no problems with the fit.  I would recommend a strapless bra for anyone who is a fuller size like myself.  I'm wearing this to a Christmas Party.  We swing dance so this dress is going to be perfect.  I did not order the peti coat to go underneath as I thought it would be to much for my affair but if you are really stepping out like for New Year's Eve it would so dress it up a bit more.  Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase.


I was really leery about ordering a small even though the measurements matched. I have very broad torso and I haven't been in a small since like middle school. But sure enough it got here and it fit fine!!! Though if you wear bras with extra padding you may want to go a size up just in case.


There were a few minor construction errors such as some loose surging that got caught in a seam  and it looks like they ran out of trim on the ruffle and forgot to trim it after they started a new piece. These are minor and can easily be fixed with by someone with no sewing knowledge.


The fabric is a nice sturdy hard fabric that seems like it will hold up well. I was honestly hoping for something that was a little softer which is the only reason I deducted a star (I sometimes have issues with certain fabric textures and unfortunately this is definitely one of them). I'm hoping it may soften up after a few washes. I do really love the design and If it softens up after washing I may consider purchasing another for a back up cosplay I'm planning.
