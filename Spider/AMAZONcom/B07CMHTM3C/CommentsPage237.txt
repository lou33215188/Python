Super cute dress


Beautiful and actually fits really nice. Have to wear a different bra but not concerned about that. Cute and sexy yet classy


Love the dress! Fit great! Looked great. Only issue is that the zipper was broken when I got it. I did have to return it, but I will get another one cause it was great!


This dress fit perfectly for my daughters graduation ceremony. I took the advice and ordered up one size. I'm a curvy 5'6" and the length of the dress just touched the ground. It is a wonderful dress.
