It was slightly dirty when it arrived to me but nothing that couldn't be cleaned off simply. A great fit and beautiful look. I got a medium, 5'8" and 160lbs athletic build, and it goes just past my knees. It's absolutely GORGEOUS and I'm extremely happy with the product!


The dress fits perfect I am a size 8  and the Large fits great. It is well made and is adorable.


It fits perfectly. I love it. It holds what it needs to hold...hahaha. I love this dress though!


Were a 7-9, 36DD with a 27-29 inch waist order a lager it fit perfectly


This dress was really cute in and I received several compliments. The only thing is the zipper broke in the car on my way to my event! It wasn't right at all; in fact it was loose. I'm 5'1" 120 lbs, ordered a medium. I wished I ordered a small. and I encourage those who are a 4 to get a small!


Overall, great buy for the money and the material was nice. And it's a true white.


I love this dress. Im 5'9, 135lbs, 34B. I ordered it in blue, and yellow in a size small. excellent fit!


I like the dress over all but it has a strange fit in the bust. Other then the bust area it is a very nice dress. It is sewn well with even seams. The white on the dress has a bit of a pattern to the fabric looks nice. I would say this dress it worth the money. Just be aware that the fit in the upper part is a bit strange.


Lots of compliments about this dress; spandexy material gives dress a bit more "give"


I ordered one size up and I'm pleased with the fit :) love the mustard color and it is a flattering silhouette.


absolutely love this dress, its light and airy even though it doesn't look like it. I love the material and quality of the dress. the style goes well with my shape. I bought a medium dress had to return it for a small. I am 5'6" 170lbs. Anna coco has great customer service, I got the smaller size dress in the mail two days after I returned the first order and the fit was perfect.
