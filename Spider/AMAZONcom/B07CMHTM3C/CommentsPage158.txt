I LOVE THIS DRESS. The material is thick and better quality than expected. It's incredibly comfortable and fits my body like a glove. I'm 5'9", 250lbs and wear US size 18/20


Great quality . Fits perfectly . I usually wear a 10/12 and I got a large. It's super cute!


When I wear this dress it's a show stopper. The price was just right and the shipping was very quick. I love it

Loved this dress. I ordered a size up and it fit perfectly. The stretchy fabrics makes it a fabulous snug looking fit. I got tons of compliments on it!!
