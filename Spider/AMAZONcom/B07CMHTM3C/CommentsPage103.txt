For the price, I think it is perfect. It fit well, material is nice, durable and not see through at all. I bought a medium and it fits perfect, for those that have a hard time and ask for measurements to ensure buying right size.. 5'2 tall so it is a little long for me,  but I am used to that chest 38, waist, 29 hips 36.


The dress is really cute. It runs big though. My daughter is a 1 or so abd she swims in it. I'm like a 4 with 32F abd it fits in the breasts but still too big in the waist. And we ordered a small.


This dress was longer than I expected. I am 5'9 and it hit mid shin. The material was a little cheap too. Over all though I really like this dress. It can be casual or a little dressier.


Great dress for the tall girls. Medium fit perfect for me 5’10/140 pounds


This is one of the most well made 50's style dresses I have bought. The fabric is great not,  too thin like one I bought previously from someone else and, the elastic in back makes it very comfortable.  It runs true to size which I like so, I didn't have to try and figure out if I needed to order one or two sizes up like a lot of other companies suggested. Shipping was very fast too.


I like it. I'm definitely going to have to wear my hair up due to the large bow at the neck.


This dress is amazing. The waist is a little looser than I prefer bu the belt solves that problem. I feel like I might be able to get away with an X-large if I wanted to but I'm pleased with the dress overall. My measurements for reference: bust - 43.5", waist - 35.5", hips - 43.5". Also it arrived much more quickly than I thought it would.


Love this dress. Doesn’t bulge in breast and fits my arms nicely.


Fits well, comfy and flattering.


Super cute dress. I thought it would be thin but it definitely is not. I don't have to worry about it being see through or anything. Glad I purchased it.
