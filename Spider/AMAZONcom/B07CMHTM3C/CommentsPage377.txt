Good


It came as quick as 2dayshipping amazon way does in 4 days and listen I realize the "industry" standard is around 5foot 6inches, but that needs to change. This would have been the CUTEST dress yet since I'm Asian and 5ft 1 and 3/4 inch tall 100lbs, the SMALL looks like ammo on me. RIDICULOUS


I'm 5'4", 30B and 105 lbs, I ordered a small and I had to take it in around the torso because it was too big, but I kind of expected that with my measurements, so I wouldn't blame them. It's also longer than I expected and falls well below my knees. Overall it's a pretty dress and looks nice. There's a hidden zipper on one side but I didn't need to use it because there's elastic at the back to help get it on and off. When they say the dress is lined, they mean a second layer around the torso but not extending like a slip down the entire dress, but that's ok because it's a solid, kind of heavy material.


Great dress, unfortunately it's too small.


Love the dress.
