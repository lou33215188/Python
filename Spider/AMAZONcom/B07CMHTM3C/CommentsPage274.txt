I went by the size chart. I measured between a medium and large, so I got the large to be safe. The dress fits perfectly! I'm 5'3" so it's a little long but with heels it's the perfect length. Great quality and I love it!


fun dress to wear! highly recommend it


Very cute and flattering material is nice.


Fits well.  Very flattering!


Love this dress and now have in black and red! Nice, quality fabric and beautiful fit! Super happy!


Material was a little cheap


Fit is a little small. But I wanted to lose a few pounds anyways.


Very cute dress, but runs large. Definitely order a size down.


The dress is beautiful and fits well--EXCEPT FOR the length.  I am 5'6", and the dress (a small) is several inches too long (it drags on the floor, even with 3.5 inch heels).  I was sad to have to return it.


Very cute!
