The dress seemed ideal for my purpose.  I was pleased with the purchase.


So cute!! Great fit and good material! I love fun dresses and even in black this is a fun dress.  I may even dress it up with a cute belt or wear it without! Either way, so cute!


Its a very cute dress and it came just in time!


chest was too small, returned.


I am very happy with my purchase. After reading other reviews, I went up a couple of sizes. I am glad that I did. While the dress has a nice stretch to it, there is a small gap between the buttons at the largest point on my chest.(I wear a 34 DD bra.) It is not so bad that a little fabric tape of a bra that reduces a little cannot fix. The sleeves are a little wide, but it really is not noticeable. I do not like the belt. I know some people like them, but, on me, this one looks like it is "too much" and takes away from the ruffles.


The length of the dress is nice. I am 5', and it hits below the knee. What I particularly like about the length is that the way it is constructed it does not hike up in the back because of my butt. I have a very round, voluptuous butt, so finding dresses and skirts that do not end up being a few inches shorter in the back is difficult.


I know some reviewers mentioned they received dresses with loose buttons. I did not have that problem.


I wish they offered this is a deep turquoise or emerald green.


It's a cute dress, and I like it.  I wish that it had a little more room in the sleeve area.  It's narrow.  If I would have gone to a medium it would have been way too large everywhere.  But overall a darling dress.


Beautiful dress, looks exactly as in the photo.


Nicely made and good fit.


Looks just like the picture. I ordered a large and it fits perfect.  I wore it to work and received lots of compliments. Love this dress!
