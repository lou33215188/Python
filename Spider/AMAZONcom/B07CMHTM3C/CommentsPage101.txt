The sleeves were a little small, but I also have wider shoulders. Just keep that in mind when picking a size. The dress itself is amazing! It's super comfortable and adorable. I highly recommend getting this dress, especially if you love the 1950's style dresses.


I tried to buy a size up anyway, it is snug but fits. I also am not used to this style, but it is darn cute.


The dress is pretty but it's much smaller than the other XL dresses of the same brand. I have a large bust, and couldn't button the dress. I'll be returning it.


I really loved the color and design of the dress.  However the belt loops were all in the wrong places.  It was not possible for me to correct this, so I had to return it.


This dress by far exceeded my expectations!!! The fabric is soft but very sturdy! I put it on and just felt gorgeous!!


Maybe i put on a few lbs, but it seems to be a bit smaller than the same style dress by a different maker. Both are size small. It's still great.


Love this, great fit, would say true to size, actually a bit big which is a first for anything online as most know. I will definitely be buying from this site again...


It was very cute, but the dress runs big. I usually wear a size small, but the small size of this dress was actually too big so I ended up returning it.


The dress was used as a costume for a party. So we bought two in different sizes, large and extra large. The large worked wonderfully so we returned the extra large dress without any hassle from Amazon, thank you Amazon. My mother looked great and felt great in the dress. It was her birthday party.


Wow, I was really surprised at how nice this dress is. Considering the money, it's a kick ass deal. There is elastic in the back but it's okay since I have a large chest. Very flattering.
