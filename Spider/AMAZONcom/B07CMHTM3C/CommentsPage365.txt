I LOVE THIS DRESS!  But then again, I am a SUPER fan of black and white polka dots.  But I put this dress on and it fits me perfectly.  The best part ... it falls 2-3 inches below my knee which is perfect because I had knee replacement surgery in January and still have a very visible scar.  For once being short (5'3") paid off!  I can wear a dress that isn't to the floor and not feel self conscious.  Can't wait to wear it on my tropical vacation.


I love my dress!


Love the dress, but the belt was missing off of it.


I love this dress?
