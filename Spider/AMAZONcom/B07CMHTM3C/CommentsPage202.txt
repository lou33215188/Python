Very comfortable.


A lovely dress for the price and is very comfortable.


Good quality but my fit was a little bit large.


Beautiful dress, I can wear in a formal setting or informal setting.

Love this dress...looks like a very expensive dress...it's a bit long for me as I'm 5' 4" but everything else is great


Very nice dress; great quality.  I love how it fits.  I'm a US size 10/12 and had order xl but had to return it for a large. The L fits just right.  I love so much I also ordered it in yellow!!!!!


Wife said that it was perfect. Quick shipping.


The dress fits nice  love it....will be being more


Wonderful compliment to the wardrobe, sweet yet summery and cute.
