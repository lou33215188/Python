This dress is amazing! The construction and fabric are great, and the fit is excellent. I would highly recommend this dress to buyers, and I plan on getting a few more different colors!


Loved this dress! Was a hit at my family reunion


So cute!


I love this dress thank you!


Love, love love this dress!!! I am 5'5" and weigh 165. I ordered a large and it fits perfect.


Dress and length was good. Speedy delivery. My 1 problem area with be thay the sleeves were a little too tight. But other than that it was great


Wasn't sure what size to order, so I decided to go with an x-large.  So glad I did.  It is very fitted in the waist and was perfect on my daughter.  If I had gotten a large, it would not have been big enough.  My first time ordering, but it won't be the last.


Lovely dress! Nice fabric and flattering. Many loose strings.


Great


Perfect my dress i loved
