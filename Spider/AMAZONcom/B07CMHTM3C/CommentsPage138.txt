This dress is gorgeous. I was very pleased of the quality for the price. I only gave 4 stars because I went off the size chart and it was a little big.


Bought it for my daughter she loves it


Thick fabric. Great fit. Got one in blue and red. Love love love them.


Nice dress, lightweight, looks as good on as in the pictures. But, when I received the dress three buttons fell off, and there are no loops for the belt.


Wore this to a close friends wedding. It was perfect for her outdoor ceremony & I received a lot of compliments throughout the day for it. Can't wait to purchase more from this designer.


I love it! Perfect for Christmas and Valentine's Day! :) It fits beautifully!


Very well made, fits perfectly. I have not worn it or had a chance to wash it, but so far very happy with the dress & my expierence.


Beautiful dress. I should've gotten a size bigger. Only thing I don't like about the dress is how stiff it feels.


apparently designed for women who keep their breasts located near their collarbones


Dress is just like described. I'm 5'9 175 and got a medium, fits perfect. The halter top is flattering and has detail.
