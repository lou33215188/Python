I bought according to the size chart and this was much too small. Gave it 2 stars because it is lovely.


I have skinny upper body. It fits well. But If you are big person with big bust, it won't go well with you. And you definetely need bandeau style bra to make them fitted.


I love this material.


Perfect fit!  Take your measurements and follow the provided chart.  I truly love this dress.  It looks great and is very comfortable to wear.


I love this dress! I was a bit worried I'd have to search for yet another dress. I purchased the creamy white dress and it is lovely. It is also made of a stretch material so it is forgiving.


The front was great but the light fabric in back did not look good, if the back had been black it would have been a keeper


This dress is absolutely GORGEOUS! Looks just like the picture and fits so well!  The dress is also very well made! Will buy again!


I this dress. Its beautiful on, I ordered a medium ( I'm on the larger side of a size 12u.s ) it hugs my middle and gives plenty of support in the chest ( if you are larger then a B, you may need a bra )


 Stitching is strong and the fabric is good quality.


  I ordered two more in different colors!!


Very, very cute dress for the price. Love the style!  It looks much more expensive than it was. There were some loose threads that had to be clipped and I decided to re-sew the buttons as they were hanging by a thread (pun intended), but that was a small effort for the cuteness of the dress.


Love the dress! Only two things I'd change:


1. I do not care for the heart shaped buttons


2. Wish there was a washing/ironing instructions tag


I always get complements on this dress. Well worth the price.
