Fits like a glove my dress size is 16-18 38inche chest I got the 2x. If I could live in the dress I would :)


Got the small. I am small chested, so it is a little big in that area, other wise it's just a tad long for my liking. In 5' 3'' and it hits mid calves. Material is nice.


The wife really looked great in it.


Amazing!! I will be purchasing the gray one too! I've never gotten so many compliments in a day before.


This is a GREAT dress! I HIGHLY recommend!


This is an awesome dress! I actually made the straps regular straps and sewed in buttons to the back. The length is a little long, but it's still very cute.


really pretty


Great dress!!! Better in person. I think it runs a little small but I got a medium thinking ahead and it fit perfect.. My daughters housewife shower is going to be great. Thanks.


I went off of the sizing chart and fit great. The dress is super comfy. Got lots of complements. The color is spot on from the pictures.


Fit perfectly and looked great.  Got a lot of compliments!  Also, it's lightweight and machine washable (dry flat).  I bought it to wear in a 4th of July parade, so both those things were pretty important.  I'm really happy with this dress.
