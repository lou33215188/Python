Absolutely love this dress


Cute idea made with rough crap material. I am 245lbs and 5ft age 21 and bought this in a XXL should have got 3X but would have sent it back because of the material PLUS THE BUTTONS ARE SO HARD TO GET IN THE HOLES. They really are a pain and it wasn't tight that it couldn't button it just hugged in a way that made me uncomfortable. Buy a better dress. The collar is rough and uncomfortable too


Very good


Great light summer spring look


Size is exacy
