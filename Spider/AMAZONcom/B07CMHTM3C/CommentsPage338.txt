The dress is well made a very cute. Longer than I was expecting. But I like it very much.


It fit great


love!


Very good


Perfect, flattering and fun


Nice fit, is definitely a full length down to my shin dress. Good material


Great Quality, Fits great and looks exactly like the picture,,


Longer than expected had to cut several inches off and have hemmed which cost more than the dress


Even better on than I imagined. Perfect fit and very lively, feminine look!


Too small
