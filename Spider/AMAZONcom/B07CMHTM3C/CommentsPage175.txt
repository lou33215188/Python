Nice dress.


Very cute but it was way too long. I'm 5'2 and it fell mid calf. The top was a little baggy too.


Super cute!!! Great price and pretty comfortable. Keeping the wrinkles out is a chore though.


My dress came in on time, fit perfectly (though, I had to hem it because it's needed knee-length for a wedding) and is better than I was expecting! I've never bought clothes online before, always scared it wouldn't fit, but I'm definitely glad I bought this dress and plan on buying more in different colors!


Too small. Material is not what I expected.


I would give this dress a five star but it was a little too big for me. I'm about 5ft and 90lbs, so I'm really tiny. I had to get this dress takin in and shoetened but other than that, it's very good quality, it's exactly what it looks like on the picture. Highly recommend this dress unless your very petitw like me, then you might have tp gwt it taken in


Looks great on cannot wait to wear for a special occasion coming up goes greasgreast with fluffy slip also purchased from amazon


Fabric really stiff and i felt likentoo much side boob was showing. Just felt really exposed and uncomfortable, had to return


Very happy good quality, I'm in between sizes I ordered a size up. Fits perfectly


Cute dress but I ended up returning it. The dress was not as long as the picture showed. The print is adorable though!
