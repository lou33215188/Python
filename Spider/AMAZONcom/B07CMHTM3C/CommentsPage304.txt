Beautiful dress! Well made.  Fits true to size. Got lots of compliments.


It was very good quality and pretty, but i must return it. It wasn`t exactly what I needed for my daughter`s play.


Love it!


The fit is great. The cotton is a bit stiff feeling but I am using it in a costume so its fine by me.


Looks as beautiful as the picture shows. True to size. Very flattering no matter what size you are!


The dress fit perfectly


Got this for my daughter, she was in a school play, Grease. Fit was good and very durable. She loves it and said she will wear it out also.


Super cute and great fit!


Very cute.  Very retro.  I can wear it to work then out for happy hour.


I absolutely love this dress and so did everybody else I received so many compliments what a bargain for twenty bucks and super fast shipping
