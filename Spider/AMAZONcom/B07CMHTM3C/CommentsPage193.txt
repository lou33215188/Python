I ordered a size large and it fit perfectly. I am 5' tall and weight about 143lbs. Bust is 34C/32D


This dress is super well made and looks great. You can't beat the price. I often see similar dresses selling for twice as much.


Lovely dress. Arrived timely. All well.


Tight in the chest. Very tight in the chest!


Super cute, very flattering. Nice length, nice fabric, great price!  Will probably order more in different colors.


Cute! The purple is more purple than I expected but totally cool. Love how these look!


Very cute I got it for my daughters birthday she's usually an XL but I got it in XXL and I'm glad I did it fits perfect!


I did think it was going to be a tad bit longer. It's very well made and for the price I was shocked ! I will order again.


love the dress ...to small gave to my daughter..sizes run small!


Cute dress for my daughter.  It fit perfectly she is 5'4" 120 and not extremely busty.  The length is just at the knee with a petticoat underneath . Color matches the picture.  Some minor problem with some stitching but I can fix that.  Over-all a good purchase for the price.
