Runs small but I ordered a size up and it is perfect.


I purchased this dress for my daughter.  My daughter is pear shaped so I ordered a size bigger just in case.  I was very cute on her and fit her well.  The fabric is a bit stiff but overall very satisfied and would order again.


Beautiful dress. Well made and delivered quickly. Tends to run a size large. Hat to return for next smaller size.


Nice fit!  I'm a size 22. Great fit, great price!


Lovely color and nice stretch fabric.


It was a nice dress, but cut way to small.


Beautiful dress. Received compliments all day at work!


Bought this as a birthday present for my wife. She really likes it and was quite happy with the fit (fits as expected)


Nice quality for how cheap it is. Nice bright color material. Runs just a tad big.


Fit as expected but too small from my busy....


I wish you make a dress like this without  or no more ironing ON it....
