The dress fit fine, but they didn't take care to line up the pattern correctly like they did in the picture, and because it uses a lot of panels, looked like a total mess.


Very disappointed with this purple dress, it faded after one wash, I own the red and the blue and that did not occur with those other colours, I fell in love with the purple and when the first one faded after one wash I ended up buying another purple only to realise the same thing occurred again.


I ordered 2 sizes up. I probably could have only gone up 1 size and it would have been perfect. Still fits and is prettu good quality.


Great dress. If you're busty, this dress may not be for you. I'm a 34DD and the top area is snug on me.


The dress was beautiful, but slightly small. Decided to keep anyways and lose the excess weight!


not an attractive dress or, perhaps, it just doesn't work with me in general. It would be perfect for a jane  (Tarzan) cosplay though!


Love, love, love it !!!! Fits great! I wear a size 17 and got a XXL.


It was too small. Had to return it.


Cute dress! I put a slip under it to make it vintage! Haven't worn it yet! Saving this one for a date with the hubby!


For a wedding, but it's a pant size too small. Had to get a larger size. The bust area is a bit awkward on me, but good quality material.
