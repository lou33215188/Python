Absolutely love the dress. Fits me perfect in all the right places. Im 5'4 and a half and weigh about 140 and the medium is the perfect fit. Super satisfied with my purchase!


Really nice dress!!! I got this dress for my daughter to wear as part of her Maleficent costume our grand daughter's birthday party and Halloween. This dress was a perfect fit and not only worked for that but also looks so nice she now has a cute little black dress. In Texas this will be perfect almost year round. The fabric is nice and the fit is very true to size. The stitching is very well done. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this was made and looks on. I am attaching a picture of my daughter in this dress. Love it!
