It's a beautiful shade of blue and flattering, but it was missing the belt, so that was a bummer.


Purchased for my teen daughter - she absolutely LOVES the dress. Fits perfectly & the top is lined nicely. Excellent quality. Couldn't be happier with this purchase - especially for the price.


I waited weeks for this dress to only be returning it. They sent me a dress that the zipper is damage and doesn’t function. The dress looks good and it’s very pretty but unfortunately I won’t get to ever wear it. I just don’t understand why they sent me a dress that clearly has a broken zipper.


The material is thick and the dress doesn't flow like I'm used to with my dresses. The color is great but its a little bigger than what I expected. But it looks great on me


Such a pretty dress. I be always been drawn to this shade of yellow, I believe it compliments any skin tone.


I would give it ZERO but can't. See through and too small. Too cheap to even take the time to send back. Yet here I am taking the time to write a review! HAHA! Don't buy. Horrible quality.


Perfect! Can't believe the quality for the price <3 IT fits just right. I bought it for my mom and will be buying one also!


I loved the dress and will re-order it in a larger size, it was too small and too short. Very pretty dress!


Absolutely beautiful dress and well worth the money! Looks lovely with or without a petticoat. Came quickly and fits perfectly. Will definitely be buying again. (I’m 5’7, 110lbs, small fit perfectly)


I've seen this dress on other websites for nearly double the Amazon price,  so I was a little worried this might be a cheap knock off. I'm  happy to report that I received a legit Anni Coco dress!


I'm 5'9" and usually wear a US size 10-12 and the large fits perfectly. It's a nice thick material with a little bit of stretch to it. It's very cute and I get tons of compliments when I wear it.
