Love the dress.


I bought this for my daughter who is very difficult to fit.  Although it was a little large for her, it fit like I expected it to and she loves it.


Well made and beautiful! I love wearing this dress and get many compliments.


The bust area was too small and I couldn't zip it.  It fit well in the arms, waist, and length. The style and material was nice.


Great dress, great material, fits perfectly


The dress was absolutely beautiful. Nice and not see through fabric.


Absolutely love this dress!


I bought this dress in red and loved it so much that I purchased it in another color.
