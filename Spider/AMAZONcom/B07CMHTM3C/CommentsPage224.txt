I love the fit and flow!! So comfy and cute :)


I'm usually a size XS or S. This was too big.


Its cute, but doesn't fit my boobs.


Great item. Good quality. I'm 5'9 168 lbs. Too short for me to wear to work.


Love this dress! I'm 5'3" 155lbs, ordered a large.. Fits perfect.


I wear a size 16, on top, DD 40 bra. I usually buy an XL at macy's, This was was too small, I got I believe an XL, or an XXL .


I returned it.


I thought the dress looked satin/silky from the picture, but it was cotton. That was dissapointing. I wanted it for a bridesmaids dress.


Love the dress. Was a little bit large so I ordered a medium to see if I would fit better and it did. I was all set to send the large one back when my sister in law asked if she could buy it from me. Awesome dress wore it to a wedding lots of compliments.
