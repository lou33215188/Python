i like it


Perfect!! Going to wear for our outdoor wedding coming up, thank you


This dress is absolutely gorgeous and I received so many compliments.  It fits perfectly and is made very well.  I received the dress as indicated with no issues.  I wore it to a 1940's birthday party and it was a hit.  See the photo attached.


Very flattering to the body


One of those cheap Chinese con companies. The dress looks nothing like it does in the photo. I'm a size 14/16, and this wouldn't even zip up -- it fit more like a body con. Order up to a XXL, it might fit a L or M. No lining, thin fabric. Complete waste of money. Buyer beware.


Absolutely love the dress! Highly recommend wearing with a petticoat!


The dress fit me perfectly. It was just like the picture. I was very proud. Thank you.


Looks and fits perfect!


well, I bought it for  Christmas and it arrived just the day before,I am size 2/4 and between S/M never XS and the S size was not really a big hit, a little too long, a little too loose, the fabric is very wrinkly, in order for it to look puffy I tried an underskirt but it just did not work, I used it but needless to say I was not confortable or felling fancy at all, it just felt cheap and sad... oh well....my fault for not ordering on time to make sure I liked it


It fits well!  The style and the material are what I want. I bought more after.
