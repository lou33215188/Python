When I received the dress it was already ripped I couldn't even wear this dress to u sister graduation because of the big hole I need my money back I am not happy with this product


Beautiful


SOOOOO cute!!! Fits soooo well and the workmanship is great! Good fabric, solid stitching, ample room for a big chest (Im a DDD and I could button an XL without any gaps)


Dress is really cute but I order according to the size chart and it is way to small.


Love the dress, longer then expected and straps were really thick so makes it a little bulky behind the neck but over all a very nice dress.


Fits perfectly.


The dress is lovely. Unfortunately size runs too small. Ordered a medium but fits like a size small. If you're considering it buy a size bigger. Plus dress above knee.


Looks great, better material than I expected for the price. The only reason I gave it four stars is it's a bit big, but should reduce with some washing. ***AMENDED: zipper completely broke the second time my wife put it on. Returning it and will take a chance on another. UPDATE: Received the second dress (bought a smaller size since the first one was too big). Still a bit big and the zipper broke while my wife was taking it off after the first time she wore it. Returning it and not buying again. Too bad.


Really nice dress. Nicer than I thought it would be.


Very elegant, fit nicely! Completely satisfied with it!!!
