Favorite dress ever!! I bought a petticoat to wear with it and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a little "poof" as this dress won't have that underneath. LOVE this dress and got many compliments on it!


Very cute, but a tad snug. I have to lose some weight before I can fit in it. Next time I'll know to order a few sizes larger.


This is a nice shape dress from the waist down. It is a little tight up top, even if you are small breasted.


This dress is so pretty, it could easily be priced higher and still be well worth it. They paired seamlessly with the "DREAM PAIRS SAPHA Women's Summer Trendy Print Gladiator Back Zipper Flat Sandals "


Fast shipping love the fit of the dress. Order your true size do not order a size up. They fit to size


I love the flow of the dress. I love the colors and the length that i wanted is great. Thank you


This dress is not anyone who's big busted or has broad shoulders. I normally wear mediums to large but even an XL is not possible with this dress. I'm 36DDD with a 31 inch wIst and there was no way this was going to fit me. Cute dress, wish it was made of a softer stretchy fabric.


Love it. It has the exact shape I wanted. And the top is supportive enough, even for us larger chested, to wear without a bra. Love it and ca't wait to wear once the weather warms up!


This is a very cute dress.  Made of cotton and stitched very well.  The fit was a little smaller than I expected and I should have ordered up a size, however, I'll use it as incentive to lose a little around the middle!


I love love love this dress. I am 5'6" and 130lbs, I got a small at it fits me perfectly. I love everything about it, the quality, the fabric, the look, the feel, everything. Would recommend to everyone
