This dress is so cute I had to order it. However, I purchased it too small on purpose. I am currently working out to get healthy and this dress is my reward. The price was amazing and once purchased it ship and I received it in no time. I can't wait to wear it.


Adorable, fun and love it!


Great dress! LOTS of compliments when I wore it to a wedding. So unique!

Easy go to dress for fun and work


This dress fit perfectly!  I was so excited about this dress that I ordered one in Red.  The red dress was 2 inches bigger in the waist than the polka dot dress.  Very disappointed!  I sent it back.  Why is there a difference in the fit? I ordered the exact same dress in the exact same size but a different color.


Very cute dress!! I will order in more colors! The material was very thin, but for the price it is great!


This dress was stretchier than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise . The fit is amazing. As a bigger girl, its hard to find flattering dresses. This dress is a keeper. Will be buying more.


Nice dress overall. I ordered a small. I'm 5'5"and about 125lbs with a size 34Bbust and 28 inch waist. My only concern is that it doesn't fit as snug as I had hoped. The sleeves are a little loose and it isn't as fitted in the waist as I would like but overall it's nice.


My wife LOVES this dress,... and I love how she looks in it!


Shipped and arrived ahead of expected time, she was surprised and wore it out to a special dinner that night.
