Color different, but not bad. True to the era length. I am only 5 ft. so the dress fell atleast 4 inches below my knee. Since the price is so great I will alter the dress to fit perfectly and add pockets. I like the length though and will leave it the same.


beautiful dress fitted beautifully


Wrinkles easy, but otherwise nice dress. Cute fits as expected and quality is fine for a teenage daughter.


If you are a large then get a LARGE...the sizing on this dress is accurate. I read some reviews and they said it ran small so I got one size bigger. But after I take it in it will be perfect for the event I need it for. The length is perfect, not too short not too long.


I plan on ordering more. Great material


I love this dress! Comfortable and looks expensive without being so.


Can dress it down with a pair of flat sandals or dress it up with heels.


Thank you, Anni Coco!!


Love this product so much I bought a second one! If you are considering on purchasing one be sure to use their size chart, not Amazon's! I stand 5'3" and weigh 150 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fits perfect!


LOVE everything about this dress. too tight at the boobs though so I have to return it :(


Ordered a size up and it fits Perfectly! Length is just below the knee which is awesome for the mature ladies.... will buy again!


Another awesome classy dress from  Anni Coco. I absolutely love it! Very happy. It's made extremely well. It's light, color is gorgeous!
