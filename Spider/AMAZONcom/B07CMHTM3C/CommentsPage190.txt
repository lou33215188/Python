Love the color and fit of this dress!


This dress is amazing! The material is not cheap it is not see through like many dresses I love it!! I bought this in white for my wedding (small backyard one) and it is just as I pictured it


Very cute, fits as expected.


Excellent


Love this swing dress for the spring/summer!


cheaper material, more Kmart than Target but still worked for what I needed


Lovely dress. Very happy.


Loved this!!


Love the color and fit! I'm 5'11 so it's a little short for me to wear to work without amazing leggings.


Very nice fabric, excellent fit.
