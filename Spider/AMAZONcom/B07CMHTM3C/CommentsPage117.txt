I really like this dress. It fits perfectly and very flexible. Although I just got the dress and I have not been able to wear it to an outing so I could wash it, I promise to give a heads up after I wash the dress. But for now I can wait to wear this dress.


The dress is exactly what I expected, it arrived on the day it was suppose to. Fits like a glove and looks exactly like pictured. I would post a picture but it was bought for a wedding that will take place Father's Day weekend and I don't want to get the dress dirty. It's perfect, exactly what I needed and wanted!


This is a gorgeous dress.  I gave it to my daughter because it doesn't fit me.  But it looks amazing on her!


Beautiful dress -just wasn't long enough for my taste so I returned it! If only it were longer ğŸ˜­


Love the dress!!!! Fits perfect I'm 36D 29 inch waist and I ordered a Medium. I got so many compliments I ordered a light blue one too.


Love it!! Very Flattering for a curvy girl like myself. I was torn between the large and XL. Decided on the large and it fit perfect. Nice stretchy fabric, not cheap and flimsy. Didn't need to wear spanx.


I bought this dress for my 13 year old niece and it fit perfect on her. She loved it!! Beautiful dress, material is very nice. Love love love it.


perfect for an all white wedding


Really nice runs small


This dress is very well made but it is a bit small for the size they say it is. I love how it feels. The fabric quality is excellent I love my dress.
