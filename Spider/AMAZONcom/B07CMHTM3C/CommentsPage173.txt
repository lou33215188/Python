This dress is so much smaller than expected.  I ordered a size larger than I normally would and it's just entirely too small.


It fits beautifully and is a lovely design! I receive many compliments every time I wear it. With it being mostly cotton, allow for shrinkage. I would normally wear a medium, but I ordered a large. After washing and drying it once it fit perfectly.


It is pretty long, but I'm happy with that. Sometimes the zipper on the side catches my skin or underclothes, but it really does fit nicely. It looks exactly the same as the picture. Worth the splurge!


nice, looks good...skims your body so hold off the cheeseburgerâ€‹ that day lol


used for pinup photo session - cute and made great with nice material


Cute dress, but didn't fit me well. It was a shame because it looked very cute online.


I purchased this dress to go with a 1940s model car we have to go to car shows. This dress arrived very quickly. The quality is nice. The fabric in the bodice area has a stretch to it so it is comfortable and will be all day.


i read the reviews and ordered an XL (I'm usually a size 12 or L) and it fit perfect.!I got the yellow and it's a great color- am considering buying in another too!


Beautiful dress


The Belt is a little long, but other than that, the dress fits amazingly. I'm 5'6", ordered a small, it comes just down to my knees. :) Definitely looking into ordering another color.
