It was way shorter than a similar brand dress that I ordered. I gave it away to someone who was shorter than me. I am 5'7.


SHORT


Ordered this dress for myself and a friend. We received them after a lengthy 2+ weeks to find them way too small and thin see through fabric.  Not happy.


I will have to order a smaller size and try again. ğŸ˜’
