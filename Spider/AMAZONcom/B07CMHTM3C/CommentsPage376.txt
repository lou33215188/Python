Great


Perfect for me


The only thing that would make this dress appropriate is an extra 12 inches of fabric. I'm 5'8" and I prefer to be able to sit and bend and walk without worrying that I'm going to flash  my personal business for the entire world to see. Does NOT match description. Does NOT match other reviewer images. I'm pretty sure it's also not a cotton/spandex blend as advertised, but  as it comes with neither a tag inside to explain care and materials nor any accompanying label to do so, I'll never know.


This is going back with extreme prejudice against the item and the seller. Ridiculous.

Absolutely love it!


So comfy fabric nice


It is not long enough to cover my feet. I was expecting a long beach look dress but it needs more fabric down.


I'm a guy who wore this as a Halloween costume and let me say that "male freedom" you receive from this dress was amazing! A few drinks into the night and it didn't bother me one bit that I was high stepping through the night in this amazing dress. I owned that dress and it owned me. We were a team. It made me look fabulous.


Nice dress, fits well and received a lot of compliments!!!


I love this dress! It has a bit of stretch, which is great. I'm 5'9" and about 185lbs (post baby #3) I put this dress on and it's an instant confidence booster, lol. I love that the waistline is above the belly and the hemline falls just below my knee.
