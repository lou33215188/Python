Absolutely gorgeous! The most beautiful dress I've ever had!


Not even worth the money. Buttons fell off when taking it out of the bag, not good at all


I purchased this dress for my birthday celebration in Cancun. I am super happy with the product! Beautiful and classy dress and I can't wait to wear it!


Using as a Grease costume, will wear again ; )


Well conceived, poorly executed. The lines are awkwardly placed, which will give you the oddest looking curves.


love, has to be ironed and it fits small but the color is great.


This dress is super cute and comfortable for the most part. It was a bit snug in the arms for my liking.


I loved it so much I ordered it again in another color! No petticoat needed, it looks better without. Perfect summertime dress.


now this is what I am talking about this is the type of dress I want my mom to use and she looks lovely in it.


Fantastic Fit. Looks really nice and slimming as well. I will be ordering more!
