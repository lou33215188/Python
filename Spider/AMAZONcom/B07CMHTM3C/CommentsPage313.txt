Very impressed with the fit of the dress...also liked that it was made out of good material for a reasonable price ğŸ˜Š


I received a dress that is a different style.


the fabric is too thin....it looks cheapy


I bought this dress for my daughters homecoming. It was a hit and everyone loved it.


I am really impressed with material which is stretchy nice quality


fun & flouncy


Bought for dapper day and has a nice elastic backing so it fit perfectly.


It's too large than I expected. Otherwise I like the quality and model


I love the style and look of this dress. Unfortunately I is a little snug so I wish that I would have gotten a little bigger size, However I am very excited to wear it.


Fits better than expected! Perfect for formal occassions or a night out!
