Came just in time for my trip! Dress fits well,color is vibrant. Stretchy in the back,so it has room. Much nicer than I expected!


I love this dress. The material is thick and soft not cheapy. I'm 5'3" and the dress goes mid calf.


Beautiful Blue color. I was worried about the cap sleeves because my arms are larger than most women of my stature, however the dress fit perfectly.


Excellent


The belt fits in an odd spot on me and the bust is snug. I wish the sizes of things were a bit more universal...


I am a large size 14 and purchased a size XXL the fit was great.  Very classy look, not too tight on stomach or butt. Material was a nice thickness. Dress was long enough for 3 inch heels. Wore it to an afternoon wedding and received lots of compliments.


The first dress I ordered was too big so I ordered another one and sent this one back. It was pretty painless n very simple to do. Dress fits nicely. I'm 5'10, 205lbs n I ordered a large. Only complaint is the fabric is very stiff n wrinkles easily.


The fabric is very stiff, it feels like an apron and wouldn't be comfortable to wear


Cute, comfortable fit. A little darker blue than in the picture but still a nice shade of blue.


This dress is so cute!! I felt like Lucy from the I Love Lucy show. It fit well and is such a cute style. Remarkable for the price.
