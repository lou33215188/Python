I love the dress, it is long enough, I am 5' 6, I usually wear siz 16, or a Zero at Torrid...but the dress is snug on my back


My wife loved it.


very disappointed. I'm 5'4 120lbs, 34B.  the black part of the dress is just maybe 2 inches in the middle, makes you look big rather than making you appear small.


My wife loved the dress. Perfect for casual parties and halloween.


Gorgeous and fit great!


Wife put it on right away and got unsolicited compliments on it.  Winner!


This dress was bought for a homecoming dance for my daughter and it fit perfectly!  Beautiful bright blue color


My wife loved this and it looks amazing on her. Perfect fit. She's blonde and beautiful and folks say she looks like Marilyn Monroe in this dress.


LOVE it!  Fit's perfect!


I did not have high expectations for the quality of this item.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the material to be of good quality, the cut to be flattering and the fit to be perfect.
