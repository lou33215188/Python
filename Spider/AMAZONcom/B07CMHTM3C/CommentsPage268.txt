Nice but not more than that


I love this dress!!!!!! If you measure yourself and follow the size chart you should get a good fit. I will order another dress in the near future!


Cute dress but lots of wrinkles.  The bust is a bit "flat" instead of contoured area for bust so it pulls forward.  I'm a DDD in cup size so I wasn't surprised.


Very pretty


Came on time and very good quality!


OMG, the material was better than expected. I loved the fit and I got so many compliments. One on my greatest finds on Amazon!


The bust area was a little tight, but the fabric was stretchy!


it was super cute and pretty well made but the sizes were just so small


Very cute and comfortable. Sizing chart worked well for me and the size fit me 100%.


Fit perfectly, love it!!
