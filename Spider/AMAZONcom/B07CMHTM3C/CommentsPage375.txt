Nice dress ...


Its cut really small


Pretty clothes, just watch your sizes.


So cheap. My goodness. The quality is reflected in the price. Material was odd, would not stay pressed, wrinkled too fast with barely any stretch, except for the puckered back panel. The stretch there was relatively useless since the bodice had no stretch. All in all, OK in a pinch. I returned it and wore something I already owned instead. Fit as expected.


I had to return and order a size down due to the stretch. The length was longer than expected, and the neck ties were far too long and bulky; had alterations done to shorten the hem to just below my knee (I am 5'7"), and cut off the neck ties and have them sewn together to make just a strap. The quality is really nice, heavy thick material, and although it does wrinkle, I have not washed it but only ironed, and that smooths it out just fine. For the quality, the price is a steal!


I love this dress.  I ordered the dress in WHITE.  I'm 5'6 and 175 lbs and it was a little roomy in the breast area but not enough for me to send it back.  I'm going to take this beauty to Cancun next month for an all white party with the "petticoat" underneath it and a huge white flower in my hair and make all the ladies envious *wink*


I love it!


amazing!!!!! :)


Fit as expected


Nice cotton material, very cute. Fits well.
