LOVE MY DRESS


Beautiful and exactly as pictured, just a little see through.


A little teeny bit tight around the chest, but it's a gorgeous dress and I LOVE it.


Was great dress and fit well!


Love it.  I will for sure buy more in other colors.


Beautiful dress!!!!


I got so many wonderful complements! This russ is a steal for the price. I wore it to my brothers wedding!


The pic doesn't give this dress justice...Absolutely love this dress


Daughter loved it! If you want it puffy you must order an underskirt. But we liked the length as well over her knees.


Awesome fabric
