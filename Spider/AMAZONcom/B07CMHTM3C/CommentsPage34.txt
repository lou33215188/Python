This dress is amazing, bottom line. I purchased the b&w in a M. To begin with, the product arrived promptly and was well packaged. The dress was carefully folded, but it did not overly crease because of the fabric, which has a nice quality (stretchy) and does not feel cheap. This dress is so flattering and feminine that I dob't even care that it makes my arms look kind of fat. My one complaint is, as a big boobied gal, that the dress does not have enough give in the top and it has a tendency to gap. I either safety pin it or I wear and cover over my bra so it doesn't look too obscene.


I've worn this dress casually, professionally, and for parties. It's a real winner and I would highly recommend it.


Iam finding that  almost every single dress I order through Amazon, are adorable, but all  TOO  SMALL.


I am not a big person.  I believe the one of this I got was xxl  and it was far too tight


I'm not sure ifyou get most of your dresses from another country, but frequently  their sizing does not jibe at all with


how big the dress turns out to be.  They save money by cutting back on fabric......hence the dresses are TIGHT.


Lovely dress, exactly as pictured.  So glad I found this dress, I have been trying to find a fit and flare dress and nothing has fit. I bought a medium, (147 pounds, 5'2 with a 36 bust) and the fit is perfect.  It also goes a little pass my knees.  As stated in the size chart, if you follow Anni Coco's sizing you can't go wrong. It is a true navy color, not too dark or light.  Love it so much I'm going to buy another color.  My only wish is if the designer could make the dress in black and a dark grey color.  As a final remark, remember the top of the dress is fitted, pay close attention to the size chart and you will not go wrong.


I have only tried on the dress and so far I love it! I can't wait to wear it tomorrow for an event I have planned. I will come back and give it 5 stars if I receive lots of compliments! LOL


I rarely buy clothing online nor write reviews. Was hesitant to even try on when I received my dress. However I opened package, nicely packaged by the way, tried it on an had the biggest smile on my face! I'm a little on the short Thick side body wise so was skeptical from the start I got the XL and it fit beautifully. I got the grey stretch. I'm ordering another. Loved it!!


Very cute dress! I am a petite lady and the fit around the waist and bust is perfect - as is the length. My only complaint is that the sleeves are big and puffy, which if (like me) you are narrow of arm and shoulders it looks like you're wearing shoulder pads (see pic). I had to get them taken in.


Quality of fabric is good. Fits larger than expected after reading the reviews. I should have bought one size smaller than I did (in other words, my normal size). Also dI'd not fit well around the bust. A bit narrow and pinches near the armpits. I'm sure it's just my body type. But I'm pretty average. Overall would recommend to others since the pics looked great on the other ladies. Just did not fit me. Sadly, I returned it.


Great dress for the price. Expect to spend a substantial amount of time with the iron to get out the wrinkles from being shipped in a small box. I removed the elastic from the back and put in a few darts to make it fit me perfectly. It was easy to alter. It looked fine before the alterations too though. I'm just not very busty and didn't need that much stretch.


I had much colors to choose from, but this colour stood out.


I received it in QUICK TIME and it was properly package. I couldn't wait to try it.....and OMG it was as though it was tailored for me I normally wear medium but when I read the reviews and check the size chart I  decided to go with XLarge....and it was an awesome fit.


I am seeing some more style that I likeğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ can't wait to drop it in my cart.


The back kept sliding down as I moved, after I put it on, for the purpose of trying it on. Since I recently washed it, I have yet to try it on again. All in all, a nice dress though. The back makes it more likely to fit anyone that purchases the dress. But of course, the elastic in the back of the top part of the dress, also can be annoying. Still, I am happy I purchased it. And I like the dress.
