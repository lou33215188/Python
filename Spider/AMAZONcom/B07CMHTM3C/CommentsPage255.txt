Just too short for me, I needed something that covered the knee and this was right at the knee. I had to return. But it was a pretty dress and seemed like a good material!


The dress is Beautiful just what the picture showed. It arrived on time and it is just what I imagined it would be.


It was for my granddaughter and she loved it.
