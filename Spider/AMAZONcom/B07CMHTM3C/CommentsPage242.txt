nice material-very slinky  Better be a flat stick


I absolutely love it great material and great fit!


Thanks


Nice and comfy


It fits as expected. And it twirls pretty well too!


Great dress and got lots of compliments,


5'7", 36C , 165.... large fit perfectly. The feel of the fabric is lovely. I feel like a throw back to the days of refined poise and beauty.


Skirt length was a lot shorter than expected; when I think 1950s I presume below the knee.  Not very flattering even though it fits right.


It is beautiful!


nice shape, not my favorite material
