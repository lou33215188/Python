I purchased this dress with the understanding of bust and waist measurements given. Though I'm not the smallest on my chest, I'm most definitly not large either. This dress fit great in my waist shoulders and hips, but still way too small in my bust area. Also the buttons fell off. They were poorly sewn on.  Fabric was that of a mens dress shirt.


Not recommended for women with small breasts. It fits funny and is very loose at the top because of that. It runs a very tiny bit larger than expected as well.


I have a lot of these style dresses and I love how this one fits! I have larger breast so the dress if perfect because it doesn't have the fitted top. It's length is around mid calf, I'm 5'6-5'7. The material isnt the softest but it a durable and super cute!


Perfect for swing dancing. Fits so well!


Decent dress for the price. Material was not as expected. A little stiff and not as flowing as expected.


Fabric is not a flat finish. It's shiny like a gymnast leotard


If you have breast dont get this dress. But otherwise its well made and a beautiful color. (also make sure you have thin arms). I returned it.


Thank you


I wanted to love this dress.  I have ordered several dresses in this sort of same style from different sellers, and this is the first one where my usual size small was a bit too tight.


It's a beautiful dress. It runs a little be small for me, I'm 38 D and is too tie for me.I definitely will try to get an XL next time.
