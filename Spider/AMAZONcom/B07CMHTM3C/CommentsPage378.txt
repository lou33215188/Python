Wow!  What a deal for $21.00!  I am 5'7" and normally wear a 4/6.  I ordered the small because I am a 36 A/B and figured it would be ok with the elastic in the back.  Fit perfectly and I don't have to wear a bra.  LOVE!


Somewhat see through...


The dress it self is super cute however I only gave it a 3 because two of the buttons fell off as I was trying to put it on for the first time and Im pretty tiny Im 5'7 120 pounds and A size a cup The breast area was more for size training bra I would for sure go up a size on the dress


Love it!


Love the dress. Need more!!!


Cheap!


It's amazing


It's a very beautiful and flattering dress. The only issue I had with the dress was that it was not a pure white dress. The color is more of an off white/cream, therefore I gave it 4 stars.  It was delivered promptly and packaged well enough.


dress is too big only because the mateial is super stretchy.  the length is really short and the material isnt the greatest... ill use it as a night gown....


I cried when I HAND washed carefully with cold w√°ter! the black went on the White part and spoiled all the dressed. It is not washable at home.
