This dress is darling! I couldn't believe how much the purple pops it's so vivid! It fits so nice and the heart shaped buttons add that little charm making it sweet.


I like the dress. The upper part of the dress was too large. I am slim on top and bottom...but round in the middle where I need the roominess.ğŸ˜¢ will try a smaller size. Hope it fits.


Fit was ok, zipper is cheap & broke before I could wear it.


im 5 ft and had to wear 5 inch heels. the skirt still touched the floor but it was so cute and complemented my curves very well. my husband loved it =) I will definitely get it tailored and wear again.


Adorable. Just a little larger than I expected it to be. I am usually a size 2-4; height 5'2" and weight 125-130lbs, with a relatively medium-large bust. This dress was large in the shoulders and waist for me. Love the color and style.


Love it! I ordered an XXL and I am a 40D. Fit great, a little snug around the arms, but otherwise comfortable.


Very cute, flattering and comfortable dress. I'm empressed by the quality of the dress for how inexpensive it is. The material is actually pretty thick and not thin at all.  I like that there is stretchy back for a more comfortable fit.


The dress is just as pictures, ordered it in my normal XL  size it fits perfectly except in the chest. It buttons up, but pulls a bit across my breasts. Besides that it's very well made, very nice material and sewn wonderfully.


It did fit my daughter nicely for her confirmation. I love that dress.


It is a little longer than I expected and the fabric isn't as flowy as the picture looks like but all in all its an adorable dress and I cant wait to show it off
