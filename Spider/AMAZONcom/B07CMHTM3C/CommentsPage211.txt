Got if for my friend and it was larger than we expected. NO big deal, we can tailor and hem it ourselves. It was also a bit too long and that has to be brought up as well.


The dress was longer than I expected, but had it shortened and worked out great.  Nice fabric.


Great Dress! It fits great and great quality.


I got MANY compliments on this dress. I wore it to a Spring School Auction. WELL worth the $ spent.


I love this dress. It is a great design, nice weight and texture of cotton. If you are ordering be sure to LOOK AT THE SIZE CHART - this runs somewhat smaller than American sizing. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large and it fits nicely. The waist is a bit short, I encounter that a lot being long waisted but the sash belt easily covers that. I intended to order the red but accidentally ordered the blue and it's a beautiful vivid blue and I have no intention of exchanging it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review. https://www.amazon.com/review/R3IWLI8IFVUVOJ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01DF1QL8K

This dress sucks I've been trying to take it back and get my money's worth back &' now you're telling me I can't return it . It's a waste of money and I'm shorted $30 so no thanks that's the worst mistake of my life .
