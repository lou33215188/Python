I recieve the dress Saturday ... I order it to big but I am going to get it fix but other than that its just like  the pic.I have very very large boobs I thought to get a xlge but just alil alteration cant fix


This dress fits perfectly and is beautiful!! very happy!


I bought this because I bought a black and white one a week earlier. It fits and looks fantastic on my wife. This is a great dress at a great price


I read the previous reviews and learned it ran a bit large.  So I ordered accordingly and it fits perfectly.  I love this dress.  It's so flattering to my very curvy figure (a.k.a. large behind).


Loved this dress. Sizing was good.. A little loose in the chest, but I'm not real big in that area, but it still looked really nice.


The dress was adorable & great quality but the sizing chart was incorrect. I even ordered a size larger than I usually wear. So I would recommend ordering 2 sizes larger especially if you are "blessed" up top.


I was very impressed with this dress. It is made well and fit great. It was a very pretty dress on too.


My daughter wore this dress to homecoming and everyone loved it.


This dress was adorable! I was impressed with the quality considering how inexpensive it was. My daughter wore it to a 50's-themed school dance, and it looked great with an underskirt.


My niece is getting married onboard ship when we take our family vacation later this month.  I bought this dress to wear to the wedding.  I am 5'6" and 215lbs.  It fits perfectly!  I am so excited to be wearing this and feeling like a million bucks.  I ordered a black petticoat to wear under it.  I want to find a strapless or halter strapped bra.  If I can't find one, it is well lined and I'll go braless.  I'm thinking I'll add white gloves and a wide hat to really go retro!


I am a seamstress, and I can tell you that this is well constructed.


I'll add pictures after the cruise!
