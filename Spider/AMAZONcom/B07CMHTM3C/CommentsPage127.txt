Cute dress!


I Love this dress! Fits perfect! I will be ordering a few more soon! Fast shipping and great quality!!!!


The dress is beautiful! I bought it to attend The Beauty and the Beast live show as Belle (Village Scene). I did noticed a few seams came undone when I opened up the package to examine the dress. Especially right under the zipper on the side, the seams came undone about a couple inches so I had to stitch it back together myself. But overall, the dress fit perfectly & I was comfortable the whole night enjoying the show.


Very small in the bust and i even bought the size up


My Mom love it, it fit as expected.


This was super cute.  I bought it to wear to dinner at Disney where we got to meet Minnie in her red dress, it was so cute.  The dress fits well, it has an elastic panel in the back to make it fitted but not snug.  The only down side is the torso is somewhat short (and I have a short torso to begin with).  A bit longer torso would have been nice, but it was a great price, thick fabric and flattering fit.


I love this dress!!! The color is vibrant, and the fit is perfect. I was a little nervous about the cost if it was going to be cheaply made but the fabric seems ok and the stitching.


Very cute dress, a bit stretchy which is great.  I typically wear about an 8 in dresses and got a large.  Fits perfect!


Super thin fabric on the gray one.  Definitely a cute style, but this design needed a better, thicker, higher quality fabric.


I really like this dress, the top was smaller than expected, nice fabric and appeared well made, returned due to fit
