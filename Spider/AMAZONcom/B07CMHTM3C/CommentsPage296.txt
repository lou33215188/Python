love it!


Such a cute dress!  Material feels high quality.  Top fits great--beautiful lines.


bien


My wife loves this dress, and fits very nice


I love this dress! It does run large though because I measured my bust, waist, and hips and it's still came to big. I'm just going to need it altered but otherwise I love it and do not regret buying it


I am 5'10" 230 lbs, Size 38 G bust. I bought the XXL it fits great. I might get a different color.


ğŸ˜� love it


I like it.


I ordered a dress that was a large for my wife and it was more like a small/medium. And the martial is stiff.


Came really fast, fit fine, just didnâ€™t look good on me personally!
