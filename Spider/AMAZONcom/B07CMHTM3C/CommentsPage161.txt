Sent back disproportionate for my semi chunky frame. wasn't comfy for my liking.


Although it was pretty on the website, I didn't like the way it fit, nor how it looked in person


The dress is really cute.  The color is as shown; however, it's a little shorter than expected. Overall, I love the dress.


The large fits a size 10/12.


Very long dress for a 5' 1" tall person, had to return. Everything else was cute but the hem is far too long!


It didn't fit me, which I don't hold against the dress. What I do hold against it is the fact the dress went nearly too the floor (I'm 5'3", 135lbs... not THAT short) and it did NOT come with the padding shown in the images.


The dress was more like an apron and really didn't have room for my breast. :( This went against that style and was a huge disappointment for me as it was supposed to be my birthday outfit. :(


I was amazed with this dress. I don't tend to buy clothing online because of my curvy body, but i was in need of a white dress for halloween, I will be buying this dress in another color forsure!


Nice retro dress, but the style isn't for me, it's still hanging in my closet, I didn't want to return it!!


It's really cute!
