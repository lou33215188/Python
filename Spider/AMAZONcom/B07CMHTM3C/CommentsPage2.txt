I hesitate getting this dress because sometimes I buy clothes online and they are some item made in china and the sizes are WAY off...usually too small. I ordered an xl (I usually wear somewhere between a 12 all the way up to 16 depending on the item) and hoped that the xl would fit. It did fit! Actually, I think I could have used an L instead because the elastic is not stretched at all in the back so I cant get any smaller with this size. I do like that the bigger size gave me more fabric on the skirt though so it falls nicely. I am 5'8" and it isn't too short, just about to mid-bottom of knee on me.  It is very flattering with the elastic smocked back pulling the front panel nicely against the best part of your tummy waist and the fuller skirt hides some areas where I don't want anything too clingy! Plus, a more flowy bottom is so nice and cool in the summer.


The only thing a little odd on me is the bust. When I tie the neck, I get a little gape in the front if I bend...almost like the straps start too far out. That is very possibly the result of me needing a size smaller (geez, it feels good to say THAT! I recently lost weight and still seem to default to bigger sizes.) I may order another since they are not very expensive. I also may change the straps by sewing them to the back of the dress so they have regular shoulder straps instead of the halter so I am not pulling the bust fabric forward by tying them upward. I love the halter style though and  may just use some hook and eyes so it can be converted from tie to shoulder strap!


It is a very nice fabric that isn't too thin. It sort of holds itself out and is crisp. I haven't washed mine yet, but if it seems to soften too much, I may iron it with some spray sizing to keep that nice look. I don't plan on putting this in the dryer mostly because I don't want to lose any length. My daughter also got one and she is shorter than I am, so I will likely dry hers and will update my review if hers shrinks or doesn't wash well.


edit: we had this for a few weeks and while I still love it, it really seemed like it needed pockets. As soon as I put it on, my hands went right to my sides to put my hands in a pocket and they weren't there. So I added some! I figured if I screwed it up, I could take them out. What I did was open the seams on the sides and put in my own pockets. I was getting rid of some things and sacrificed a satiny camisole for the fabric, but you could buy a yard of lining. It has to be thin so it doesn't bulk up the dress. Then you cut the pockets. Straight on one side (where the seam is,) and sort of a mitten shape (without a thumb of course) for the rest. Sew each half of the mitten on the dress around the mitten, then attach the item along the seams. It was a little tricky on one side where there is a zipper, but you just sew the zipper on on side of the pocket. It sounds trickier than it really is...you are basically just opening a seam, and adding a teardrop shape. If you google "add in-seam pockets" there are a lot of instructions and videos around. If you have a garment with in-seam pockets, use that to help you see what you are aiming for. I am no seamstress by any means, and I did it in like 45 minutes. LOVE the dress so much more now!!


One year ago I saw picture of this dress on the web and saved it. With my friend's help I sewn dress in dark blue color. Few days ago I have found this dress on Amazon on a good price and decided to get  dress in red color. I love it. Material is thick cotton. Dress is very good quality. I am very happy about this dress and planning to wear on special event in August. Also, I am thinking about getting this dress for my sister.


I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review which is based on my personal experience


This dress is super cute. Constructed well. Rich colors. I wore a petticoat underneath.


Love this dress! The material is kind of like a work shirt. I washed it and had to iron it. I suggest getting a petticoat. It makes the dress look poofier. I'm wearing one with the dress


I was given a gift card as a token of appreciation and wore this dress to a gala. It fit absolutely perfect. The dress is fitting for spring and adding "a few ruffled layers"  provides the subtle pop that gives it the wow factor! Another wonderful thing about this dress is that it is perfect for ladies with small waists and curves. It accentuated my coke bottle figure in a manner that was both tasteful and elegant. It fits true to sizeğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾ğŸ˜˜âœŒğŸ�¿ï¸�


Most of the reviews and pictures are for the dress with the ruffle on the front. I bought a medium in the "pure orange" dress, which I thought was mostly like the other colors but is missing the ruffle. Nope. It's shorter. I still gave this 4 stars because it's not the dress's fault that I'm tall and a prude. I'm 5'9" and about 140 lbs. On top I'm a 32C, and I'm about 40" at the widest part of my hips. Being a younger-looking teacher at a high school, I won't wear a dress or skirt that doesn't touch my knee. This wouldn't come close. It falls just the below mid-thigh. I'm posting pictures, but the angle gives it the appearance of being longer than it is. (I don't own a selfie stick, so you're going to have to trust me on the length.) I considered keeping it and wearing it during the summer, but I'd be too concerned about being able to bend over in it.


The top fit well, and with shorter legs and a run through with an iron, it would be perfect. I just can't.


I love â�¤ï¸�ğŸŒ¹ğŸ˜€  These dress it's beautiful I get a lot of compliments when I wear it  I wear large but I  ordered 2x and  it's a little bit but  it's OK maybe extra-large was better for me  The material it's thick but it's fresh and I love it it's worth it  it's worth it  thank you thank you â�¤ï¸�


Let me start by giving you my stats so you can get a concept of the size you will need because you must order this dress, it is ridiculously cute!  I am 5'7 210 and a 40 D.  I wish I would have had better stats for my size in the reviews so I could have ordered an XL instead of a XXL because it was a little loose in the bust.  It stretches in the back so and gives you a little room to work with and breath in and out comfortably.  I did not wash or dry mine it did not have any very noticeable wrinkles so I did not even have to iron it either.  I wore this to a wedding and it was so comfy and light weight I felt fabulous all night. I waited til the last minute to order this dress so even with the $3.99 extra overnight delivery this dress was still under $25.  Incredible right! I was very skeptical of the material when I first took it out because it almost feels like a thin jean material (but its not) but once you put it on it's like WOW who cares! I had a little belt that I was able to add to it but I didn't need it but it did add a cuteness to it.


I love this dress! It is very cute. It is nice because the small sleeves are not tight, which I often have troubles with in dresses that fit everywhere else. There is only one issue I have with this; the bust area is a bit tight (I included a picture). I almost need to wear an undershirt if I am to wear this to work because you will be able to see my skin and bra if I don't keep an eye on it. Otherwise, it fits perfectly everywhere else! Also, the material seems a bit different than I thought it was going to be, but I still like it. My measurements are 37.5, 28.5, 37. I am 5'5" and 128lbs.


Ordered the dress for a Pinup photo shoot,  it looked amazing.  It was just what I needed. In the photo attached the red one and white one were ordered.
