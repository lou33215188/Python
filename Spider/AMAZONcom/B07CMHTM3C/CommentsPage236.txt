Super cute dress! Thanks so much!


Wore it for my second day at a new job a few weeks back. Actually about to wear it again tomorrow.  I love this dress and will keep buying more like it.


a little long for me but really cute!!


Cheap material - weird cut around the arms and bust - super short.


Great dress! Comfortable and beautiful and fit just as I thought.


Great quality!!  Love this dress!!


Adorable.


The gathered detailing at the bust looks strangely lopsided like the center of the bunch is shifted too far to one side, and the waist seam falls in an awkward place on my 5'1" mom. It's like whoever measured the torso couldn't decide whether it should be an empire or an A-line. The material feels like the stiff, slightly sandpaper-y stuff that Halloween costumes are made out of, and given the quality of the stitching, I'm afraid of washing it even once since it might fall apart. I bought it for a wedding, but it really does remind me too much of a cheap Halloween costume.
