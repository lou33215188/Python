The dress itself is well-made and beautiful...just didn't fit so I returned it and the seller processed my refund right away.


I have a small waist so it fits everywhere but there. I will have it taken up when I get a chance.


Arrived on time. Very Good quality. I am 5' 10", 150 lbs, 34 DD.  I purchased a medium. Can't complain and I am thinking of purchasing another dress!


It's beautiful,  but I couldn't wear it.  Good news is my oldest daughter can so I gave it to her.  The dress size is misleading.  4XL is truly too big for me,  but not in this case.  Very disappointed.


Good stage piece. Actresses loved the fit and look. Fabric is stretchy. Nice, full skirt and can be worn with can-can slip. Very nice stage piece.


love love this dress everyone tells how pretty I look when I wear it. The  zipper gets stuck but that a problems I have with dress I order online but this happened to me all  the time beside that I love it that the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars


If your bust size is a C cup then it fits a bit tight, but otherwise it is perfect, and that is why the four star rating.


It fit as expected, nice and snug on top but not to snug and then it gets flowy, the only thing is I'm a little short so it was so long on me I had to hem it, but it's a small price to pay when the dress is so cutee and it's well made, not like cheap feeling you know what I mean?


I can't be more impressed with this dress or the seller. It is beautiful fabric and it is made very well. On me it looks like I had it made to order. I just love it.


Adorable. I wore this to a high school graduation and it as light but cute. Great style, adorable and doesn't make me look like a little girl .
