Beautiful dress!! It fitted very well. I didn't like the sleeves, though.  They are too large.  I had them changed and shrunk by a tailor.


This dress is adorable! I bought it in Sky Blue first and loved it so much that I bought it in Red too. The only problem I'm having is that it pulls a bit more in the buttons despite having wiggle room...I think I'm going to take my sewing machine to it and sew the fabric together.


While I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my review, I still would have gotten this dress in a heartbeat. :)


I have yet to put it on ,but I am sure it fits. It looks just like the photo. No tricks and no surprises with this one.


Fit was perfect following the size chart. Dress quality is great and it looks amazing! Will be ordering more dresses from Anni Coco soon!


I read the reviews and ordered 1 size up from what I normally wear because of bust. Arrived yesterday, fits perfect. I LOVE IT. Made well. Pleasantly surprised.


This did not flatter my body. It has very little stretch.


I love this dress. It's adorable. I'm 5'8 with heels, a size four and 34DD bust. I ordered the small and it's perfect. It still hits below my knee and isnt too tight anywhere. I ordered it for upcoming graduations, parties, Vegas and summer in general. Looks like I'll order more!


I used this for a Lapis Lazuli cosplay; it was perfect! It fits well and has a really nice weight and flow to the fabric that makes it spin out really nicely when you twirl.


A lot of people complimented me because of this dress :) It really fits me. I chose the smallest size that they have and it's perfect!!! It is kind of long though since i am 5 feet tall. However, it didn't bother me at all, Overall it is really a good dress for 1940-1950's theme.


Love this dress!  Great materials and very well made. Flattering fit for curves if ordered properly sized (I ordered 1 size larger and it's perfect ) great for summer weather!
