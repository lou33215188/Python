Fit great And worked wonderfully for the occasion


Description on size is not correct


I am giving this item 5 stars because it fit as expected and was a vibrant red. I did not keep the item, solely because I ordered the same dress in black as well and liked the black a little more.


This dress is amazing! The fabric is thick but stretchy and SO SOFT!  I am in love!


Very cute, but not as full skirted as it appears in the photo. Runs large as well


My 16 year old LOVES this dress.  It fits well and looks great on her!


I am a fashion Designer and i found this dress beautiful and dressy. Runs a little small but i bought 2 sizes bigger, and then I can alter it....however, have to be careful because the black part has somewhat stained the white part....the black fabric is running ir√° blackness....i dont know the wood in english


Such a beautful dress. I chose the trublack it makes me look skinny. I'm 5'5 138 lbs 28 waist 32 bust and 36 hips Quality was good everything was awesome!


Great dress! perfect while walking the strip in Vegas, very comfortable and stretchy material!


Very nice material. Bottom fits perfectly but chest is a bit tight. Really cute and comfortable.
