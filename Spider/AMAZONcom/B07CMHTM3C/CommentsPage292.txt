Great price for a Halloween costume. I would use this seller again.


Super cute dress! I normally wear a small, ordered a small and it's perfect.


The material was not as described and the zipper broke.  It's a cute dress but I didn't like the quality and it's being returned.


This dress was well made but ran small. I would definitely order again, just one size up.


Beautiful!


Fit perfect !!


A little snug by the waist. I have to pull dress off over my head vs stepping out of it.


Exactly what I expected


Needs more support in bust area but very lovely dress


Love this dress!!! True to size.
