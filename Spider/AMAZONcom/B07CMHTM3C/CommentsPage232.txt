Thank goodness I looked at the sizing guide before purchasing!  I normally wear a 14/16 but ordered at XXL and it barely fit.  Glad it has a little stretch to it.  If you don't have the model type of slender waist this dress is hard to wear.


My dress is pretty


This is a lovely, stylish, fun dress. The material isn't bulky and is light enough for a warm summer night on the town. It's not see through and appears to be well made. I like the style and find it very flattering.


Fit perfectly, no alterations needed.


I love this dress so much because it's long enough to be work appropriate, the material is great, & of course because it's so darn adorable. I'm 5 feet & 7 inches, 190lbs.


Great dress, love the fabric and its easy to iron.


Loved dress, it is sheer front and back, unable to wear to a wedding like i hoped, but fit my body great. Beautiful color /pattern. Hope to wear soon


I love this dress. Was a little long for me cause i am short so i took a couple inches off the length but it fits nice


Beautiful color and fabric.


It is made from good quality material and fits nicely. I bought a M and am a size 6/8. Great dress for the price!
