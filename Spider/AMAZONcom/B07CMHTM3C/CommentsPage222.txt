The zipper was broken out of the box. Beautiful dress otherwise.


Love the dress and it was a perfect fit.


Its a beautiful dress but if you're under 5 feet, it will come to the calves.


Too cute! Fits like a perfect glove I purchased a medium size I'm 5'4 weight 150lb


Love this dress


Classic


I like this dress. The top portion fits betters than some of the other dresses similar to this one. The top portion supports better. I don't that my bread are exposed when I bend over.


Loved the dress, adorable


It wasnt the best quality and the dress was too small.  Very disappointed.


This is a cute, fun summer dress. It is comfortable and can be very versatile depending on your event. Great little dress!


loved it.


Just a bit snug in the bust but other than that just great! Color is beautiful.
