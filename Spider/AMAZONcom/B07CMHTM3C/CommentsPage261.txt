Absolutely love this dress! It fits perfectly and the color is beautiful. Looks great with or without a petty coat. In love!!!


Gift for wife. She loves it, the fit was perfect and matched the sizing chart according. Style was on point


I bought this dress for my baby shower, I didn't expect it to fit because sizing online is kind of hard, man was I wrong! This dress fit me everywhere it should and me being so short, it was the perfect length for me! This dress is very flattering to any body type!


The dress was too small in the bust and too short for my height.  Im sending it back.


I love this dress. I feel absolutely adorable when I wear it. It's a great plus size dress!


I love this dress. I immediately ordered a size smaller because I knew I loved it. It's the perfect length and the small fit perfectly. I love the classic style.


I love this dress, makes feel very classy (I don't wear dresses much) best part about it is that I have some baby fat left from my last pregnancy and this dress hides it, only bad thing was I didn't get the belt :(


I wear a size 14 and I ordered a 3X.. A lil large in bust area. Need undergarment if you want it to puff out


Super cute! A bit long (a good bit past my knees) but I'm short and can sew so no problem really there!


soo soo cute
