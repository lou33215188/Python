Very pretty dress, however was not what I expected. I did not know there would be elastic in the back, the top was two big and the straps were horrible. I had to take it to a tailor to have the whole dress altered. I needed the dress for a wedding on Saturday.


Dress is beautiful and fits perfectly.


not as dressy as i thought


So cute! I am 5'8" tall and it sweeps the floor, I also have DD chest and fabric expands nice yet hugs in the right places.


Love the fit. The only con is after washing the white section of the dress does not look as bright.


This dress is perfect. We got it quickly and the quality is great, my daughter loves her dress... thank you!


Beautiful dress but did not fit.


This a lovely dress and fits well. I don't love the heart shaped buttons because I'm not 10 and I deducted one star because two of the button holes are sewn shut. Overall a great buy and with such a classic silhouette it will become a year round staple.


good


love it.
