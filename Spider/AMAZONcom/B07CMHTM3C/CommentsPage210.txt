Love this dresa, can't wait to order more in different colors. Super comfortable and fit perfectly.


Gorgeous


As described


I love the dress I just couldn't button it up in the chest so I had to send it back but I will order again just bigger size


I love it. The dress arrived quickly and fits well. It will need a little ironing, but it seems like the fabric is sturdy enough for that.


Excellent fit.  So pleased I made this purchase


dress didn't fit well and the quality of the material felt cheap.


Seems to be good quality. 'Small' end of extra large. These fit well. May want to go a size up if bigger.


I love this dress! It looks and feels great!


Although the dress was slightly small it is otherwise a great fabric with the spandex and style that came packaged neatly.
