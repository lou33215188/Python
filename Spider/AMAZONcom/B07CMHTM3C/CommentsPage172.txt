Dress is greta! I ordered up one size because I read the reviews said dress ran small. Usually I am a medium size 7 juniors or 6 misses ordered large & fit perfect!  Wearing it to a 50' s theme mom & dad prom fundraiser for my daughters high school. My daughter loved the dress so much she ordered it in another color.


best dress ever looooooove it! Fit is great has somewhat slimming effect in love


This was a birthday gift for my wife. It fit fine. I read the reviews and deduced the right size. The fabric is nice quality and she seems to like it.


I bought this dress for  my daughter for Sunday church, she  looked beautiful. The fit was perfect my daughter is 5'3 133 lbs and I ordered  medium or 9/10 .


Adorable, lots of compliments and comfortable.


If there was an option for more stars,  I'd give it to them. I'm in Love with this dress. I'm 5ft 2 1/2, 160 and all hips. I ordered a large and it was a little too big. I took a chance and ordered a medium and it fits perfectly! I immediately ordered 2 more. These are perfect to get through the brutal Texas Summer. I will note that I'm going to have to have them taken up a bit, but I'm not going to fault the seller for my lack of height. : )

Nice dress, I must say but was too small for me unfortunately.
