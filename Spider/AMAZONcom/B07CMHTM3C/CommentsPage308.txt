What a cute, fun, comfortable dress!


Love the dress  should be great for a summer day


Too small bust for my figure type but it was a good quality and lovely design


Love, love, love this dress, very good quality. I plan to buy in different colors. I really like the heart buttons! Pretty!


Just look and see that


The material was too thin and the dress was too small. I sized it correctly, but it was way off.


Perfect :-)


Love the material and dress fit great. I am short 5'2 and 200 lbs but the dress was very flattering


Love it!! This a really well made dress. Absolutely beautiful quality


Runs a bit small. I wear a 24 normally , bought a 2X. It was about a size to small.
