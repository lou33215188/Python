Absolutely LOVE this dress!  I love the fit, the length, and the way it makes my waist look smaller!  I want them in every color!


Beatiful dress. Fit as expected.


I am very large chested so the dress won't button up. if I got a bigger size it wouldn't fit anywhere else. Love the dress none the less.
