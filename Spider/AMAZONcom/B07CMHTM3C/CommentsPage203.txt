I love this dress. Perfect for any occasion.  Comfortable,  no need for the petticoat for me, I think it would take away from the way the dress falls. This dress will be a staple in my closet!


I like it even better on!


I'm 5'7" and weigh 163lbs I ordered a size large and fits perfect, I also like that it has a bit of stretch to it. I will definitely buy another one.


Way too small. Extremely short


I love it but for me, I needed to add a petticoat to make it look better.


Way to short. If you are taller than 5 6 this will be above your ankles.  Company gave a refund for getting something that was obviously show an much longer.


perfect for what i needed it for. its a nice stretch fit. even in the bust area  fits nicely


It's ugly in person


This came in torn, Very see through would not recommend to any one


I have several of these dresses and every time I gp out I get not 1 but several compliments on how great the dress is. It took my by surprise because these are all complete strangers out of the blue telling me how great the dress it.


So Yes!! I am loving it.
