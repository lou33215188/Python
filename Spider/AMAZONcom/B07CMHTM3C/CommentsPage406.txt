I like this dress, but I am glad I listened to the other reviews and ordered 2 sizes larger than I would normally wear. The dress I received was floor length, so I am unsure why others received shorter dresses.


Good quality and looks great. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review, all opinions are my own.


This dress is so cute! It is well made and fits nicely. It is true to size, so the large was a "normal" large.


It a beautiful red!!  A great material.  And washes very well.  Looking forward to buying somemore colors!!  **** Love it :)


fit a little tight but love color


I got this for my sister for her birthday. It arrived on the day I expected and is absolutely adorable. I got her a medium, which is what she generally wears, and it fit her. I'm considering getting one in a different pattern for myself


This was a gift for my daughter.  She had picked it out along with other dresses on line.  She said it was beautiful and fit perfectly.


I absolutely LOVE this dress! It is very formal feeling, but comfortable.  The bottom hangs beautifully.


Love this cut. The dress is super cute. Great fabric.


Cheap stitching, though.


Reviewing for AMZ.


I absolutely LOVEEEEE this dress. I ordered this dress to my actual size and it is perfect. I even ordered it prime and received it a day early. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!!!!
