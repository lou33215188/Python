Fits perfect


Lot complements. Like everything about it. Full. No label for washing or care though


This a great dress.  Good quality, beautiful color!


the elastic in on the back allowed me to wear the Large. I tried the Xl and it was a bit loose. I'm a 38D or 40C depending on bra, and the chest allows room for your breasts rather than squashing them in flat.


Fits perfect!! Came in mail fast too.
