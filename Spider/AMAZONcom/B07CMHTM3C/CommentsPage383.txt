I love the dress. I followed the size chart in the description and it fits exactly as it says. It's a bit long for my short self lol but everything is long for me. I'm 5'1"


Dress is awesome, comfortable and fits well!


AMAZING quality!  Nicely tailored and a great fit. I ordered an XL and I'm 5'6", 170lb and a c cup. I usually wear a L in dresses but sized up and was glad I did.


Absolutely gorgeous dress!


Nice material.....beautiful dress.


this dress I must say fits nicely but im VERY disappointed that I ordered a white dress and instead got a cream/offwhite dress its nothing like shown in the picture but its cute but which I got what I ordered


It runs very small. Fabric is a little thin.


Smaller than expected. The bottom part flows well but the top part gapes under the armpits and the bust appears to be made for a small child. Not a becoming look.


Order it to fit my daughters demintions and it was WAY TO BIG!!!


Cheap quality, made from cheap material
