Cute dress


Love, love, love my new dress!! I feel like a star from the 50's in this outfit. Lightweight but well made. Can't wait to wear it!!!


I love this dress! Fits just as expected, looks good with or without petticoat and the color matches exactly, is just what I expected. I know my friend will love the one I ordered for her for christmas as well!


Love, love, love! Perfect fit, extremely flattering, and rocks so much attitude! I haven't worn it out yet to really test it's quality, but I have high hopes!


Love this dress! It wrinkles easy is my only complaint!


This was terrible. It came in crinkled and stained, the material was a cheap looking plastic-like blue so I didn't even bother trying it on, because I would never wear it.


Dress came quickly and is made of quality material! It is so cute. It fits perfectly!


Its nice just very large in size


The fit and the color!


Cute style for summer.  Great value.
