It's pretty over price for the quality of the fabric. It's made nicely and everything but minus 1 star since I don't think it's durable. But very cute  and conservative dress.


needed it as a dance costume. worked great


Got so many compliments on this. They couldn't believe the price or that it was an Amazon purchase :)


Bought this in a size 4 (the smallest available) for my size 3 34DD girlfriend, it fits her perfectly and she adores it! Good quality for the price you cant beat it.


Dress well made,  arrived on time but 2xl is like a large. It is so cute to return so will give as a gift to someone.


The material is nice, not see through, and the fit is proportionate. It is true to size. It looks very nice with a crinoline.


It's okay. Pretty color. Needs to iron. A bit too big. Should have ordered a smaller size, but I am not going to exchange it to smaller one coz then I don't know if it would be too tight.


Am in love with this dress. It fits just fine and I can't wait to wait it out.


My sweetheart looks adorable in this dress. She liked it so much that I ordered a red polka dotted one as well.


Great dress for the price, you get what you pay for with the stitch quality. I bought the dress to wear to Disney world and it fit perfectly, was nice and light for the heat but the stitching unraveled during the day in the bust area, it's fixable but seeing as I hadn't worn it more than 3 hours and it was literally falling apart there can be some improvements


It is cotton and a very nice dress, I'm just going to have it re stitched
