Fits small good thing I can get it on


Good quality but much too large. I weigh 130 pounds and am 5 ft 5 inches I was very surprised. The smalls fit well.


she looks amazing in it


I love the dress. I added a petticoat and it made me look kinda fat but the dress is well made and fits well.


It fit exactly as I thought. Love it, kinda stretchy fits well. I will say if you have big arms or broad shoulders it will enhance a bit. Still love ithough


Such an attractive and comfortable dress! When I first tried it on, I carefully unbuttoned the front so I could put it on. Apparently, unbuttoning is not necessary. I found that after I turned the dress inside out to wash, there's a zipper in the left side.


Absolutely beautiful. My only problem was when I tied it the center front had a gap.


The waist was much too large.  It was delivered after the date promised, but was marked as  delivered on time.


The only downside is I ordered a size too small. I already reordered in the next size up. I love the material, it's breathable and comfortable, and the dress is the perfect length, falling just below the knees. (I am 5 ft 3)


Perfect fit based on size chart provided. This dress looks fantastic on and accentuates my curves without being overly revealing. The fabric is not too thin but wrinkles easily. The wrinkles don't bother me much, so still a five star dress.
