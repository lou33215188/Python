It is little large for me but the belt covers it. Very cute dress!


So flattering!  Vintage styling, without feeling like a Halloween costume.


Excellent fit and beautiful dress!  Wore to a Christmas dance and will wear again in the future!


My wife hated it. Quality was poor, material made her itch. I regret spending money on this.


A gift for my wife and she was delighted. Need I say more?


I love it.


I liked but little big fine


Really nice but runs very small


Good quality fabric.  The belt is optional, and I actually prefer the bow to be tied in the back.


It is fun and flattering. True to size
