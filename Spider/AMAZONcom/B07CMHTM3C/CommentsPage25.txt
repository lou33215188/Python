I love everything about it. My only notes are: it came a bit wrinkled (so I'll just steam it, no big deal), and the zipper was a little hard to zip up, but once it did the dress fit fantastic. For reference, I'm 5'4" and 130lbs and usually wear an 8-10, and ordered a Medium.


This is the cutest dress.  I normally wear a Large, but bought a an XL because reviews stated it was small.  It was, so i returned it and bought a XXL.  It fit, barely, but it did.  Then i washed it in cold water and machine dried on delicate for about 8min, pulled it out and let it hang dry the rest of the way.  Went to put it on and it was smaller than the XL i originally bought.  I am so sad, it really was a great dress, until i washed it. ;(


I loved this when I saw it, and the reviews were so stunning I had to give it a try.  When it arrived, the first thing I noticed is that the buttons were round.  That was a bummer, but not a big deal.  I tried to put it on and...yikes.  It was so tight!  I went by the measurements in the description, as well as the reviews, and for me, it just didn't work.  I wasn't able to get it over my bust, and the shoulders were very tight.  I wished I'd known this before I bought, and I'd have purchased it in two sizes larger.  I bet then it would've been perfect.  I'm hoping the seller will decide to offer more sizes again soon.


This dress is so high quality, especially for the price. Such a great value. It runs a little large, and I'm on the super busty side, so don't size up. It's super comfy. It's a little longer than I like so I had it trimmed and hemmed. But still a great buy! I got so many compliments on it, and I was the perfect pin-up Alice for my bday.


It is a cheap material, but I don't mind it. At first I thought it was too big around the waist, but with the belt that it came with I could adjust it. It was also longer than I expected, but I like that. Here is a picture. It's super cute. Everyone likes it on me and if I were to go to a 50s vintage store it would be about triple the price.


This dress is so cute. I bought it as part of a costume. Most of the costumes are too short these days, but this comes down to your knees which was perfect (I was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz). I originally bought a petticoat to go under it and it looked just like cinderella's dress so I decided to go without the petticoat, but it's great that this dress is versatile. You can definitely feel the quality of the dress, it's not cheaply made with flimsy material. My coworkers said that they could see it being wore as a regular summer dress but I'm not completely sure I can pull it off. All and all a great dress for my purposes though ğŸ‘�


ADORABLE!  And so well made.  For the super-cheap price, I thought this thing was going to be terrible quality, but it's not.  It's as good as I'd buy in any department store.  No -- probably better than that. My daughter loves mine so much that she HAD to have one too.  Hers is just as good as mine.  I wish they'd start making more dresses -- not just in this vintage style (I got this for a costume, actually).  Because they're quality is first-rate.  Don't hesitate to buy this!


This dress is great. Upon opening the package I notice it's in a nice zippy bag which automatically perked my interest to its quality. The fabric is breathable yet thick and stretchy all at once. It has the feel of good quality. The fit is true to size. I ordered a size up. It goes to my calves. The back is bunched to offer more room and as I said the material is stretchy as well so I'll probably order my actual size next time. I will for sure be ordering this dress again in other colors. I couldn't be more happy with this dress.


I am 5'8, 170 lbs, and a 36C. The Large fits perfect! Fit to my body but not too tight, and its the perfect length as well, maybe 1 inch from the ground.  I tried the XL as well and its way too big. The fabric is not the lightweight thin cotton that I was expecting, but a thicker, heavier, stretchy evening type dress feel so it may be a little warm in the summer. There is also a zipper down the back to help put it on. The only thing I do not like are the shoulder straps. they are very thin and feel cheap. I may sew my own on there.


Beautiful dress, and sturdy material. Apparently, I had one of the main issues other buyers had, and it was the tightness in the bust area. I ordered up a size (XXL), but still had to make a few adjustments to get it to button. I order the red, blue, and white dresses, and had the same issues with them all. If they made it in a larger size, I would have ordered it, and gave 5 stars.
