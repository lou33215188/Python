Dress did not fit right picture makes the dress loo great but it was a lot longer then I wanted


arrived on time, fits as expected. Its going to go great for the 50's party we are having.


I like this dress. The length is a little short. I'm 5'7 and its above my ankles.


Just as the way it shown on the picture.  Love it.


The dress is fun and fits well - a little large for me but not enough to merit sending back for a smaller size. Would definitely order again from this vendor.


I thought that I already did a review of the dress but I continue to get emails asking for a review... the dress is nice I like it.  When I tried it on the fit is great.  The material is thick and color is bright red.  I ordered a medium and am 5', 6" and around 130lbs and full breast and, like I said, it fits nicely without being too fitted or too loose.  I will be sending this to the cleaners to be pressed and will probably need to take care to not wrinkle it too much when I wear it.  That would be my only complaint - which isn't much of one because the dress is truly a well made dress.


Wore this dress with a small crinoline to give the skirt extra swing.  Small fit well (I am 5 foot, 114 lbs.)  Super flattering.  Nice material and color.  I got lots of compliments.


This dress is so flattering! I got so many compliments! It's super comfortable too!


It's a really pretty dress with swing to it the only down size to is is that I can stand to lose a few lbs.  Other than that it's great


Very pretty.  Nice shape. Too big. I am a 34D and have a 28" waist so I ordered a large. Fit fine up top but too big in the waist. Returning it. Should have gotten a medium.
