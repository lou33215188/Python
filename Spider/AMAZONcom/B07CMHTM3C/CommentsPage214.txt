This dress was purchased for homecoming. The material is great the true to color.


what a great dress! fit like a glove!


Really love the dress. Fits well. I ordered a size, medium. I wear a size 8 and weight 140 pounds. Bust size is 36b


Looked gorgeous and elegant on me.


Nice dress, but you should definitely order up one or two sizes.


I love it! Excellent quality!


Adorable dress, nice fabric, and good quality!


Pretty dress, but wish I would have ordered a size or two bigger. WAY too tight, especially around the stomach.


Beautiful dress, great material for the price. There's a little more room in the chest area of this dress so I would recommend sizing down if you're not exceptionally busty. The back is rather stretchy, there will be room.


4 star only because it wasn't wrinkle resistant. It looked very nice on my teenage daughter. I will buy more of this brand in the future.
