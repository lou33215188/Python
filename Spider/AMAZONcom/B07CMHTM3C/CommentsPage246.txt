I love this dress!! It was a great price, and it feels like a high quality dress, especially for the price. The fit was perfect, and exactly what I expected it to be.

Beautiful and fun summer dress! I love this dress! It's flattering and fun for warm days!


Size 14/16. This dress is amazing. I didnt think it would fit if i got an XL so i chose a XXL because im a full 36DDD..theres no puckering at all with the buttons. I will be ordering another.


The dress is a little small in the chest area


5' 10"  125 lbs size small


I ordered this for my daughter to use for her latest play. 60's style was needed, it looks perfect for the part.  The full elastic/stretchy back makes a great fit.  Surprisingly, even long enough for her height.


So cute to wear.


Excellent


Adorable.
