The length is perfect! Fabric is nice and thick.


Great fit. I really like the material and the way the dress flows.


Great dress!  Exactly what I was looking for. Fits perfectly.


Perfect fit. My husband loved it


Fit small but the items are good quality


The dress was made out of cheap looking and feeling material and the sizing ran wayyyy too big for me. I fit all the measurements, but when I got it, I was SWALLOWED WHOLE by the material. Didn't really like the halter tie either, it was too bulky for my liking. I have returned my dress, so to those buying just keep in mind, it runs large, not just big!! Maybe the materials are better in other colors, I just ordered the plain black.


Fit was perfect and material was nicer than expected! I was very pleased


Fit great


Fits wonderful an excellent dress for the price
