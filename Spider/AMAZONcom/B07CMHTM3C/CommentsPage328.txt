A little big but very great material!


Super fast delivery. Great dress. Nice quality cotton fabric.  Incredible for the price!!!


So adorable! I'm using it for my Snow White costume. Fits perfectly with a little bit of stretch. Love it!!!


Exactly as pictured, fits like it was made for me, and how can you beat that price?!


Wasn't anything what it looked like in the picture and made of really cheap uncomfortable material.


A bit small just in the bust area. Overall good fit and loved the dress.


Love it


Fits perfectly


I got someone to alter it for me. It was fairly large to be a small medium.


Awesome!  Thank you.
