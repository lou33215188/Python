Great! Love it. My measurements are 36" 30" 36". I got the size medium. It fits very well and is very flattering. With this style I like the waist part to be tight so I maybe could have gotten away with ordering a small. I think I'll order another color of this dress!


Really cute dress and perfect for the event - but it runs REALLY small.


Awesome dress fits as expected. I ordered a small. I'm 5'6" and 140. Love it. Very vintage look


Beautiful!! Color is gorgeous and fit as expected...


Beautiful color and shape. Came very wrinkly though so be ready to have to iron it.


I really love this dress, especially for the price! I bought a similar one elsewhere for $50. My only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily.


I've not had the opportunity to wear this beautiful piece yet, but when I tried it on, I was instantly in love. I purchased a medium because of the elastic piece across the back. The material is soft and light, non-see through. The girls sit-up nicely, it accentuates my waistline. Absolutely adore this. I will be purchasing in a different color!


Great quality and very comfy.


excellent !


A beautiful dress, I love the color,  I normally wear a large but went up a size to XL and it doesn't fit (Tight around the top) I'm keeping the dress and started my diet..
