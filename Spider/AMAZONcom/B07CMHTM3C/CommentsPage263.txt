The material was much stiffer than I thought I was hoping it was some more fluid cloth and I didn't look that good in the type of sleeves nor the ruffles


Fits great and compliments my figure


Great fit and well made for the price. Lots of flexibility built into the design so it can work for a variety of body types. Suggested sizes are spot on. Highly recommend!


Love it!! Fits great I am 5'4 120lbs and got a small


The zipper was cheap as soon as I zipped it up it got stuck and came apart, however I took it to a seamstress and she removed the zipper and it fits perfect. Pretty dress


It is a tad bit too small I am normally a 6 which is what I order but fits more like a 4. It is an awkward length because I have really long legs so it hit funny but great quality and worth getting hemmed.


I ordered an XL and it was a bit too big in the chest area and it was a little longer than I anticipated. I like it though and I received numerous comments about how nice it looked on me.


Beautiful dress, but didn't fit as expected. It's too big and no smaller size. I'll definitely have to return.


High quality product shipped promptly. Very pleased with this item.


It's perfect! The material, the size and everything about it is perfect
