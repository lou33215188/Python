Beautiful color. color Delightful dress. My only problem is the button wasn't sewn on the dress when it arrived. It was in the package, just not attached.... which was weird.... The buttons seem to be sewn on pretty loosely, but it's nothing i can't fix myself. I love it, regardless. For the price, it's an awesome dress!


The dress fit like a glove . I ordered a medium and I weigh about 130 and 34d would order in other colors


Love the dress! My 12 year old loves the dress. It fits her perfectly!


I ordered a size M.  I am 140 pounds, 5'6".  It fits perfectly, but I would not want to gain any more weight!


Its a nice dress, just remember it runs a little small, so adjust your size up.  Very sexy dress!


Love this dress!  I have 2 already, and get tons of compliments on them!


Fits like a glove. This dress is absolutely adorable and complements every curve.


See through, thin material. I do wish the back was black too.


Very pretty


It's okay, but it was shorter than expected.
