Everything was perfect. I will be ordering more colors. I love this dress. U guys did well


I love it! Not too tight, not too big! And its extremely comfortable


He dress fits perfect and is exactly what I ordered.


I wanted to love this dress but just couldn't. The fit was very strange. I feel weird saying this but the sweetheart neckline came up too much. It should have sat lower on my chest. I purchased a medium but could have easily fit in a small. Maybe that was the problem? The material is thick but not heavy, definitely not see-though. For reference: 5'6", 115 lbs (long torso), 27" waist, 36" hips, 32DD chest. If your measurements are similar to mine, go with a small. I didn't have enough time for when I needed the dress to exchange.


Awesome dress very pretty


Product is true to size, my wife loves it and it looks forward to wearing it for events. Great price as well.


Fits like a dream and I get lots of complements when I wear this dress out. It's great for every day wear or special occasions.
