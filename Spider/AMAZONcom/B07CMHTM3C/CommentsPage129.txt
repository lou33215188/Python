The dress fit perfectly and was a huge hit for a bridal "tea party" themed shower!  I added a nice big white hat :)


This is a gorgeous dress. I had to return it though. I'm 5`9" and 185 pounds with more of that weight below the waist. I had nothing to go in the top. :)) It was too big for me. Even a smaller size, I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to fit in it through the waist if it fit in my boobs. Love the dress, the style and the material. :)


The material seems cheap but is ok


Very cute. I picked gray color, which turned out to be a little too monotone for me. maybe in different color it would look even cuter.


Hubby likes how I look in it!


The material is a bit stiffer than expected, but overall the fit is great and I love the color.


This is a very cute dress. I wore it to work on a day I had a lot of meetings and I received a lot of compliments on the dress. It looked very professional


Love tis Anni  Coco Women's Halter Polka Dot 1950's dress. I am 5'8 and weigh 140 lbs. and the size 10 fit me perfect. Love the quality too. I can't believe how fast it shipped. Sooooo Cute!


Cute halter dress, bought it for a white party, will look great with a crinoline underneath! Very 50's style, makes you feel like Marilyn Monroe!


the dress was somewhat large, but it's due to my wife weight loss, it's a very nice dress and she loved it, so next time we're going to chose a smaller size.
