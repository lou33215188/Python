On the chart im a lg in bust but lx in the rest, so i odered a xl, it was a bit of a squeeze to get in it, but over all it fit nice,


Haven't worn it yet but I tried it on. I LOVE IT! I will update review once I actually wear it out!


If fit fine. The feel of it was more of a cotton than silky feel.


I love this dress.. The only thing I am in trouble is that it opens in the front.. Perhaps it doesnt happen if there were more buttons.. I also would add something to stand the belt in its place.. The material looks great and with a good quality. And it streches!


I'm a size 12 and i ordered an x-lrg and it was too small!  The sizing chart is way off, not sure if an XX Lrg will work either, the dress runs too small.


I'm 5'1 and 123 pounds.


I bought the small and it fits me perfectly.


And the dress is light so it's good for summer or if you go to a tropical area.


The dress is a good quality material. I ordered white and you cannot see thru it. It is elastic across the back which had a tendency to bunch up because it fits a little loose, other than that it's very flattering. I am 5'6" and 123 lbs, 34DD chest. I ordered the small based on feedback from others and glad I did. My husband loves it.


The dress is pretty and fits nicely.  The color of the dress is dark purple and its very soft.  There's some give in the fabric which makes it very comfortable.


The dress was very well made wish the zipper was sewn in better. There is padded cups in the bust area and it is lined in a white silky material. The dress fit perfectly and wasn't to short at all. The fabric of the dress is a bit stretchy so there is a little give, but not to much. I would definitely order this brand again the quality was amazing for the price point!


Too long and too stiff. Didn't really like it. Had to wear as part of a formation, but otherwise I wouldn't have bought and kept it.
