I'm 5'4" and small frame/chested. The style is still very flattering for my figure. I purchased as an easy cocktail dress for any event.


Lovely shape, but I was not a fan of the fabric. I was expecting a matte finish but this is quite satin-y/shiny. I thought it looked pretty cheap (which, to be fair, it was) and a tad more costumey-y than I was comfortable with.


I GAVE IT AWAY TO CHARITY. iT LOOKED ADORABLE BUT IT WAS WAY TO SKIMPY. If I had been girdled and bound I could not fit into this size 14 dress. Live and learn. Will stick to names I know. I didn"t loose any money to speak of so again lesson learned.


I returned the dress as the fit was a bit snug on me. The construction of the dress looked well made.I wish it would have fit as it was a cute dress with a nice cut on it!


The design and color are great. The dress does run a bit small but I have found it to be a little too short as well. I'm 5'6.5" and 140lbs and I ordered a small. I have decided to keep the dress and to try it with a petticoat.


I was worried about coverage due to my bust size but it fits perfectly. The back is elasticized which helps with fit. The halter strap is a bit long and I might need to alter that. The flare is perfect, does not make your hips look too wide. I will be wearing this with and without a crinoline.


Runs just a tad small in bust, but overall great. The grey stretches in bust enough that with the right bra, it doesn't look like the buttons are strained.


Side note: I'm 5'9, and I'm use to the torso being longer, but it fit just right. ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼


I'm so glad I bought two! I bought this in purple and black with big fuchsia polka dots. I didn't have high expectations, because the price was so reasonable. It's well constructed, and the material is opaque. It looks equally good with or without a petticoat. I'm 5'7, 150 and a 36c. I got medium and it fits perfectly. I would totally recommend.


Got this for a theme party. Definitely use they're size chart, and based my size off that and other reviews. I'm 5'0 and about a size 6. I have a large bust 36D. This fit my bust which was my main concern. Only thing bad is the length for my height but I was anticipating that anyway. It was slightly longer than I thought is was going to be (at my lower calves). My thought was it would be mid calf. Nice quality for price


I really wanted to keep this dress, but it was too small for me in the bust. I ordered a Large, the biggest size they had, and it fit great everywhere but the bust. I'm a 36DD. Super cute though. If an XL comes out, I might buy it.
