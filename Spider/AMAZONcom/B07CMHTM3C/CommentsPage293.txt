cute dress and it fit everywhere but in the bust. Buttons pulled.


Loved it fits perfect and it's really comfortable


The medium we ordered was too big, but the right length. The xtra small fit through the bodice, but 6 inches longer than the medium. Inconsistent product overall.


This dress is so pretty. I can not wait to buy more like it.


I love it


I am using this dress for a Halloween costume and it is perfect for that! I am 5'3", 160 lbs, and small chested. I ordered a medium and it fits great.


I wish i would have gotten it one size bigger and then it would have been perfect. But i enjoyed wearing it nonetheless


Nice thick material. Fits perfectly. I bought a large and its a little long, but I'm only 5'4.


Very flattering!  Has a bit of stretch which is fantastic!


Great dress ! Already got a compliment first time wearing it.
