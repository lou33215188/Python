I like it the only thing about it is the arm holes are tight on my arms.


Great dress!


Love the way this dress fits !!!


I don't know about the other reviewers, but this dress was HUUUUUUUUUGE on me! SO BIG. I usually wear a small or a medium in clothes, or a 6ish in things. Pretty averagely sized. And I was DROWNING in this garment. Maybe it's because I'm only 5'2"? But it did not hug my curves at all, simply overpowered them. It was huge EVERYWHERE, not just where I am on the petite side.


My measurements are 5'2", 125lbs, 32G, waist 25", hips 39". I got a small.


I ordered a small but it was more like a large


It fit perfectl. Got so many complements on it.


Not what I expected nice dress very long and sassy


Happy to have it


Thank you


It was as wonderful as I had hoped!


Super cute I love this dress
