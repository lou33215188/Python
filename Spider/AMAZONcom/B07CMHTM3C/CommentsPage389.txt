This is a perfect dress. If you like it, buy it!


Love this dress! Looks great with heels or flats


Expected more.


Made a great gift!!!


I reallly love this dress, but unfortunately it did not fit me in the 2X.  Very pleased with the prompt shipping and packaging.


These dresses run smaller than sizes in US Department Stores. For price, quality is pretty good. Needs care in home laundering.


Fun dress fits too small


Nice dress!


Cute design, but I somehow missed that the back part is completely beige! Very unflattering...


Cheaply made,loose threads, stitching offline,doesn't fit and doesn't look nothing like the picture
