Thank  You  Beautiful  Dress


This dress is nice, a bought a size up and it fitted perfectly.  However it certainly without the top button even though there's a button-hole. Sad


Very cheap material.  Cheaply made.  Seam came out.


The dress fit very nicely, especially in the bodice area. I especially like the gathering on the front of the chest, they made my small boobs look great!


My only regret is that the fabric is relatively cheap cotton. Well made for the price.


Love this dress it looks adorable with the Rockabily Tutu. I order an xlarge and it fits perfectly. I received several compliments.


love all about it
