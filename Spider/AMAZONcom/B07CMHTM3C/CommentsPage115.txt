First of all, I love this dress!! The color, the fit, everything about the style. However, the quality is cheap (what can you expect from a $25 buck dress?) The stitching is loose and I haven't even worn it yet. I probably will have to stitch it up some before I can wear it...


For the cost, the extremely fast shipping, its a very nice casual day dress.


I absolutely love my dress. It was ordered for my family reunion 50's theme. I originally ordered a small but because I am a 36 "DD" I returned it for a large, a medium would've worked though.  So I would recommend ordering a size up if you are busty.


I love this dress!!!! It's fits perfect. I ordered a size large and I usually wear a size 12.


A bit small, but it still works!! I love it!!


I LOVE this dress! It's very flattering and fits really well. I'm 5'5" and 110 pounds and I ordered a small. It reaches the floor but isn't so long that it trips me when I walk.


I freakin LOVE this dress!! Not only is it true to size but it is made very very well. Its great material and im extremely impressed and happy. I will ve ordering another in a different colir ğŸ˜�ğŸ¤˜ way to go Amazon!!!


Oh my goodness! This was way shorter than I had anticipated it being! I thought it would flow past my knees but it stopped about 2 inches above! I am average at 5'5 height. Cute but I can't wear it to work.


My daughter loved this dress for Halloween.  Great fit, she got a M and it fit her - she's 5'7" and 13 yrs old


It was a nice dress but the small was huge on me (I usually wear a 4 or 6). I returned it without an issue but I would definitely recommend ordering a size down


This dress was much nicer that I expected at this price.  The fabric doesn't feel cheap and the sewing quality was very good - lined bodice, finished seams and invisible side zipper.  I may have been able to buy a size smaller due to elastic back but overall fit very well.  I am going to buy other dresses from the line.
