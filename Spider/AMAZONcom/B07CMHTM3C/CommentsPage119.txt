I would've paid so much for this dress. It is GORGEOUS. The fit is really form-fitting and flattering, but it has enough stretch to make it comfortable. I had to buy another design after wearing it.


This dress is AMAZING! I'm a bit short so I will admit that if your tall you probably won't like it as much. It is better than I expected. I am wearing it to a Black Tie event and am really excited about it.


This dress is simply gorgeous!! Who knew amazing sold fancy dresses. Easy to dress up, or down and nice thick material.


Very happy!!


dress is just as pictured, nice fabric, i am 5'4" and it touches the ground like I like! perfect dress! will post a picture soon!


Fits great and it super cute.  I do wish there were belt loops, though.


This dress is stunning, I'm 48 and to get complements from teenagers is very funny.  I have never had so many complements on these dresses.


Grandaughter.... Slightly snug.


I bought the 2x I'm 5" 5 and wear a size 20. It's so adorable.


I love this dress. It's swingy, floaty, and fabulous with or without crinoline underneath. I like this a lot and would buy it again in another color!


The quality of this dress was better than I expected. It fits well, and it is perfect for work or going out. I love the heart shaped buttons, ans they are swon on with care. I am looking forward to wearing this dress again and again.
