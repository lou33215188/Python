Cute dress, fit was too big so I returned to get smaller size.  Excellent customer service, easy rerun.


I love this dress.  I ordered a large and I am 5'8 and weigh 166 and am small chested. It fits like a glove.  I am going to look for others like it.  I have received so many compliments at work about the dress.


Great dress, awesome for dyeing, great quality and good price.


Completely different dress arrived.


Only similarity was color.


love the dress! fit as expected according to size chart


Absolutely adorable dress. Perfect fit.


Dress fits perfect and looked great.


The dress is a nice cut and looks like the picture.  It definitely needed to be ironed from the shipping but that should be expected.


Don't like that the dress is above my knees! To high above my knees!


Beautiful Dress!  A little longer than expected, but that turned out to be perfect also!!
