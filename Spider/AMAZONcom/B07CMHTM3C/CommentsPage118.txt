LOVE THE DRESS, SOMEWHAT SMALL INSTEAD OF SENDING IT BACK FOR A LARGER SIZE I WILL LOSE A FEW POUNDS AND IT WILL FIT PERFECTLY. COLOR IS REAL NICE.


The material is so good and is well made.


Gave it 4 stars because the sleeves  are small


The dress looks well made and fits well.  it's a little longer than expected, so we're going to hem it. Very happy with purchase.


I love this dress. It was very comfortable. The length is perfect for date night or church. I would definitely buy more in different colors.


The fabric is soft and stretchy. But the black part of the dress is odd, did not work for my body type. Maybe if you have a hourglass shape. The black part is only on the front part of the dress.


was a haloween costume


High school theme week, fit PERFECT, made GREAT and looked awesome for 50's day. AWESOME price, highly recommend!


I wore this for a Halloween party and LOVED how it looked! The fit was a bit large. I am a plus sized woman and order a 2X based on the measurements provided. The material makes ironing and steaming the dress a necessity, so be mindful of that. Overall, it is a fantastic dress and bound to look even cuter with some alterations to make it fit perfectly.


This dress is very comfy and can fit so many body types due to the stretchy panel on the back. The skirt is nice and full and twirlable. Overall a good, cheap dress.


Good pin up or Disney dapper day dress! Long goes at/ just below knees. Fit Fine
