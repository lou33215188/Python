This dress is awesome. I got it for my wife and she looks incredible. The material is pretty thin, but she says it's very comfortable.


Very cute, got a XL but it's a little loose on my back area. Overall very cute for my bridal shower.


Super cute! Is dyable! The only con is that is wrinkles easily. Beautiful dress, good buy!!!!


I bought it for a halloween costume, but it looks sooooooo cute fit to size. my body looked good lol


Large Runs way small.  I should have ordered XL.  It's a lovely dress and color.  I will have to exchange.


It is a lovely dress. It is a bit short, but fits nicely. If you are top heavy or if you have a full waistline this dress is not a good. Match. I love it but it is not white but beige. Cool and comfortable.


I love the dress. It's just as cute as it looks in the picture. It has an elastic panel in the back to hug me. Ordered a peticoat to wear with it. Feeling girly when I wear it!


Fits nice!


very good product and just fit tight, but we like it.


Tight across the bust. Especially like the skirt part of the dress. It was great for the theme party attended.
