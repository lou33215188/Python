I am in love! thanks to all the ladies that reviewed it and all the pictures i was able to gage my size and what i thought would work for me! the fabric is amazing made very nicely and i die for the color i picked! love love love!!!!!!!


Love the dress but the button aren't as intact as they should be.


This made me look like I was in a patriarchal cult, one of many mother-wives. Very creepy looking, though it did make me look younger and the color is flattering; It's just not the look I am going for ever.


The dress fit well but the material was a bit thin. The purple color I purchased was not see through though I feel a lighter color might be. Very pretty dress.


This dress is so adorable!


The dress is extremely cute and  I feel very feminine when I wear it.  I fell in love with the dress and I feel deeper in love when I put it on. Im Very happy with this purchase.


I'm 5'6 and 164 lb, buy a Large


My daughter needs this for a play that she is in and it is perfect! Exactly what we were looking for!!!


This dress is beautiful and fits great. I ordered XXL. I am 5'3" and a 42D, very nice fit no pulling in the bust area. The material  stretches if you need an inch or two this dress will work.


Not what I expected. It was super long on me and the color was not what I thought it would look like. Super cute dress just not for me.


Iâ€™m 5â€™5 and 140lbs and the medium fits perfectly - although, if you have larger breasts than a full B, Iâ€™d order a large. Itâ€™s very cute and classy looking!


I love it and it fits nice. I'm 5'9, weighing about 215, dress size is an XL, fits great and the material is thick and not thin, which is great.  ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�
