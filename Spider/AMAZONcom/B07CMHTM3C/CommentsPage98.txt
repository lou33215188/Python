This dress was not really as I had expected.  This fabric is very thin and just fits a bit "off".  I am short and large busted, so maybe that it who it looked so strange.


Beautiful cute dress, fits well. Very fun and flirty.Nice weight to the cotton.


I love the idea of this dress very cute vintage looking however my mistake in ordering partly it is beyond too small ,  I will return it but hopefully today I will get the same dress in a large.


this dress is for my mom but she is a petit woman so the small still too big for her, she said the good quality is the most important for this dress, she will recommend to anyone


This dress was just what I expected and I love it.  I may return and purchase another one.  It also arrived on time and fit perfectly.


Love it. I took to the suggestions of ordering a size larger and since it is stretchy that worked. a little  loose but doesn't look it because of stretch. I like it that way. I love this and get tons of compliments in it. I wore it to Disney to go disneybound as Minnie :)


I love this dress- everyone loves this dress! So many compliments every time I wear it.  Easy to iron, thick material.  Can't beat this price!


Perfect for costume purchased for.


Loves this dress for the price! I'm 5'7" ordered and XL and it fit great!


Dress is beautiful and fabric is not feeling, however it does run big. I have 34DD breasts and stand at 5'2" 135 lbs, but a medium was still noticeably too big. I will still wear it because its beautiful. But thats the only reason I won't give it 5 stars!
