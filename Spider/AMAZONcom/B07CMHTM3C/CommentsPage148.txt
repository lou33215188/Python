I love it ,the print us really cute .it came on time..and is true to size and the material is so soft..i am bery pleased with my purchase.


Love it fit perfectly.


BEAUTIFUL


Dress for well but was way too short. Barely came to my mid thigh and I am 5'4". Not at all like description or picture described.  Total waste of money.


I'm a size 16 XL fits fine, fun dress!


Fit really well except for around the chest the the spaces inbetween the buttons pooched out a bit and im not that large busted.


Love this dress! Fit was perfect! Wore to a wedding and it was gorgeous! Definitely get!!!!


Love it! Looks great on me. Interestingly, both M and S size fit me fine...


Fast delivery.  Good packaging.  Originally ordered dress in size large.  I had to exchange for size medium.  The dress is a bit long on me in the torso and 5" past my knees. I am 5'3" and 150 lbs.  I am full busted (bra size 34G).  Good dress for the busty woman.  :)


Very comfortable and rich color (royal blue).


Beautiful and fun. Seems to run a little big. Will probably have to be taken in on the torso
