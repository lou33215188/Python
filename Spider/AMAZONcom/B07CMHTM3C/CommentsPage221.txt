Beautiful dress and fit perfectly


Got it for a gift. Finally got on right. She just adores it and it looks really cute as well as fits nicely.


Nice dress but a bit smaller than anticipated so I had to send back. Would just recommend going up a size more than you normally would when ordering. No problem returning.


I did not like the fabric, thought it was cotton but it is lycra.


Bought for a Halloween custome. The Quality is amazing.


I absolutely loved this dress and wore it for a costume on Halloween and got many compliments. I wouldn't suggest putting the petticoat underneath because it kills the look.


Great dress! The fabric wrinkles when rumbled dry but it softened nicely after the first wash. Perfect dress for picnics in a Louisiana spring day.


Absolutely beautiful dress, you won't be disappointed. The material is of good quality and is a very flattering look for anyone.


Looks very cute on.


I absolutely love this dress! The fit is perfect, material is great. Overall just wonderful. I'm extremely happy. The heart buttons are a cute touch.
