I am loving this halter.  It fits perfect.  It is fun and flirty.


Fast shipping, got it within two days :-).  I'm 5'3 and 128lbs.  I got it at that size as I was afraid the XS would be too short.  This small length if perfect.  it goes down to my ankles.  The dress is very flattering and the black in the front covers my little mommy pouch.  I love it and it's not tight at all, stretchy material.  Worth the price.


The dress fit well and I looked fabulous. Although I didn't particularly like how the elastic fit in the back, I enjoyed wearing it.  Thanks


I liked the dress. It's just like the description and it fits as expected. Good quality and fas shipping. Thanks!


You all need to be more accurate with your sizes. Fits too small


Actually a prety good dress for the price. Fits as expected.
