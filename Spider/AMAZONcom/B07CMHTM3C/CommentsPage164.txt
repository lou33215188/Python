I cant even begin to describe all the compliments I get. Its gorgeous and comfortable.


Ordered size Large but still too small in bust area. Will see if there is a larger side because I like this dress.


I'm 5'3" 125.....it fits perfect!! Love the style!!


I'm 5'8 190 with curves and the xl fitted me very nicely


Looked great, felt great, fit great, but as i was trying it on i noticed the.zipper was split amd wouldn't work.  Quick refund and all is well.


I got this dress for my wife as a surprise and she looks stunning in it.


Dress is cute...but since it is stretchy...it is a little tight on me...I would recommend getting one size bigger than what you would usually get.


The fit is perfect. It is the exact style of one they sell on Modcloth, 1/3 of the price and better cut on the sleeves. Great dress.


Zipper broke before my daughter even got to the dance...was very disappointed.  I stitched it up quick before she left so she could at least wear it but it will probably not be worn again since I'm not able to fix the zipper.


My daughter loves this lodress
