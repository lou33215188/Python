RUNS SMALL. love this dress! Good material and very nicely made. I wear a 12-14. Usually XL but needed 2XL.


Bought this for my sons fiance and she loved it..... the fit was perfect.


The dress is lovely and the fit is great - not too tight in the waist like some dresses. Only 4 stars as the fabric is a little rough and the darts over the chest are a bit odd and may require some tailoring.


Bust 31"


Waist 29"


Height 5'3"


I loved it! Got a lot of compliments!


My daughter wore this dress to her Homecoming dress and LOVES it!


I did not like the style after I put it on, so I returned it.


This dress is darling and fits as expected!


I ordered a size oppsmall. I am 5'7" and 120lbs. This size small fits me well. Not too tight at all. A little breathing room. The dress is comfortable and the material is really nice! It feels silky smooth and the blue color is beautiful.


The dress was very pretty but way too large....I could have easily fit into a small.


Somewhat small in the bust area.
