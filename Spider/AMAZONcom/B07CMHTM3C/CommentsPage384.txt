I love this dress! I wore it to a wedding and received many compliments! It was flattering and made me feel very comfortable. Would buy again!


I bought this dress to wear to an event tonight (arrived today). The dress has a tear in the back, so it looks like it's being returned. Besides the rip, it is a very figure flattering dress. Too bad I never got to wear it.


I don't yet quite know how I feel about this dress.  For the price, it is a good find but not sure it is "dressy" enough.  The material is somewhat cheap, but the fit and style are very cute.  Worth ordering if you think you may like it and have amazon prime, that way you can return if you do not like it.


So cute! Get so many compliments on this. I'm 5'6, weigh 140. A medium fit me perfect in every area.


Way too small for the size I ordered

It was too long in length for my preference.


Perfect fit. I am 5-8' and the length is perfect. Beautiful Dress.


I was surprised, this dress is just as nice in person as it is online! Fits great, comfortable and sexy!


i wish it wasnt so long but it is beautiful
