Beautiful vintage dressğŸ˜�


Material felt like a hard table cloth


Gorgeous flattering dress! Didn't expect it to be quite as dressy of a material so that was an added bonus. I received many compliments at the wedding I attended and it worked out perfect for the occasion


Daughter loved. Wish it came in petite. She has to take to get hemmed next week.


So  many compliments.  Fits true to size!


I am in love with 1950's inspired dresses, so I was so happy to find this on Amazon! It came just as expected and fit perfectly! I bought the red/white polka dot dress and it is so beautiful! I definitely recommend buying!


Rlly cute ğŸ’–


Quality on the dress is not good. Cheap fabric. Disappointed


Love the dress! very comfortable.  Went by measurements provided and ordered a medium. Should have ordered a small. Not bothering to return it. the cut of the dress allows for it to be a bit too big without looking bad. FYI,  made of a stretchy material.


I love the dress, I feel great in it. I did get the biggest size. I am a plus sized woman I'm 5'10 and the skirt hit right above the knees. The the dress fit well around the girls and the belt was super cute. I will definitely be buying from this company again
