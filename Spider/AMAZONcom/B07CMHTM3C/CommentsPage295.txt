Fit is fine, fabric is good but the color is not at all as expected, photo shows a nice lighter purple but what I got was a deep plumb color.


The dress was odd in the button area.  Very weird in the neck area.


Love it! Great dress- haven't figured out the bow yet :D


The dress was nice but not for my body type im a 5'7 mixed chic with hips. This dress is more for a really short Pettitte lady. It was up to my knees when i tried it on lol so now i just wear it to bed.


Perfect and great price


I bought a XS size, the quality is unexpectedly good and fit my body just right. Love it!


I absolutely love this dress I do wish there were more bright colors to chose from but I'm gonna purchase another one anyway


Great fit


I bought this for my tween who hates wearing dresses and she loves it!


Very nice dress. Love the color.
