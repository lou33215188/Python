Wife looks great in it, fit as expected


I am 5' 10" and usually wear a size 12 in both jeans and dresses (bust 40 inch, waist 36 inch). I bought the XL in this dress and it fits PERFECTLY.


This dress is gorgeous! i was so scared by some of the reviews i read, but when i put it on last night i felt gorgeous! I am 5'5" and big boned. i weigh over 200 pds. I have an hourglass shaped body and heavier on top and bottom. it was a tad smaller than expected in the midsection. The length hits the floor! Nice material too.


Hope that helps future buyers!


Adorable.  A bit longer than expected.  But nice quality.


Loved the dress.  Well made. Nice material. Very classic style.  Great value!!


Tight around rib cage, otherwise it is fine. Material very light and airy


I loved the material and the city if the dress but it's just a bit small. Really adorable though and seemingly well made.


Excellent quality. Fits great. Folloe measurment chart.


Looks great without petticoat as well. The dress hsngs slightly below my knees. Im 5'3, 34-28-38.


I ordered a small and I still have wiggle room.


The colors are rich and vibrant.  Love this dress!


Very nice dress for the price. More well made than I expected. I really like it and honestly would buy it in almost every color if I could! It needs a sash or belt for sure but overall pleased with the purchase.


my friend loved it
