I love it!!!


This dress is beautiful! It was hard to figure out proper size to get since reviews didn't match my description so I decided to order a large. I am 5'5, 140lbs, my measurements are 36-30-37 & typically wear a size 8-10. It is too long for me to wear flats so I wore wedges. I received a lot of compliments.


Waist runs small, should've bought a large


It was a bit small, it said fits as expected.


Perfect fit.


I'm returning it!


was not big enough but I loved it


exelent


I love this dress. I've already bought another dress from this company.
