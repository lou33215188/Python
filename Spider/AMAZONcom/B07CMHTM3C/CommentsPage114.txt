It is a cute dress.  A perfect piece for your summer wardrobe.


Look, I got this for my wife just taking a long shot that she would like it and, Bingo.


She loves it! I followed the sizing chart and it was correct. Looks great on her. It hits right at the knee and fits well everywhere else.


Thanks Anni Coco!


So cute!  I am 5'9" and this was a good length for me.  So cute.  Got a ton of compliments on it.  Everyone asked where I got it.  Paired it with a cropped  Jean jacket


Great product I would recommend it again.


The dress is beautiful, very nicely made, but runs a little small.


I love this dress! I get compliments all the time, including from strangers, and it's beautiful.


I can't say enough about this dress> It is fabulous. It hangs great. I receive tons of compliments every time I wear it. It runs a bit small. I would size up. I am  5'4" 135 lbs 36d. The large fits like a glove without pulling on the buttons. If you are busty I would order two sizes up confidently.


My wife got it for a Belle costume and loves it! I think it looks amazing on her too! She is planning on wearing it to dances as well.


Love this dress! Fit as expected. I got a different belt to go along with it but got many compliments on the dress.


It looks beautiful in my daughter and the color is just as in the picture. Great buy!
