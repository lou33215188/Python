OMG, I'm in love! Too cute, fits perfectly! Love love love it!


I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion


Product doesn't look anything like photos. Size is much smaller than expected. Very disappointed.


I love this dress. Unfortunately my bossom does not fill out the top as I'm sure it was designed to, but I am not as abundant on top as some. Otherwise the dress fits perfectly . I bought 2 and I am pleased


Love this dress, highly recommend it


Very classy, comfortable, beautiful dress. Ordered in two colors, will definitely order more!

Lovely dress perfect fit


Loved this dress. I ordered it in a xxl.  Fit was perfect.  The arms/shoulders were a bit tight.. Yet manageable.  I added a white tutu to.have more of a flare.


Love this dress and it is a stretchy material that I flattering


The size chart said it runs small so I got a size larger than I would normally wear, but I couldn't even get it over my head. I actually double-checked that I hadn't gotten a child's size by mistake! It's a cute dress, but does not conform to standard sizing at all.
