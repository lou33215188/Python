I ordered this for my 16 year old daughter and she loves everything about it. The fit is great and accurate according to the size chart-she's got a narrow rib cage and I may snug up the back an inch if it doesn't change after washing but I think it's perfect as it is. She's 5'10" and 140# and it's flattering and stylish but mom approved as well which is a tough combination


I'm blown away that I just received such an amazing product for the price I paid. I search for vintage dresses but due to my 34F bust I have a hard time fitting in them.


I ordered an XL because of all the other reviews left and I feel I could get away with a large. The fabric is fantastic and "thick". Which I mean not cheap. Irons out beautifully! Excited to see what else this line has to offer!


It's a little snug across the chest area.


I @&$%ing LOVE this dress! It fits so perfectly! I'm a top heavy size 18 so i was worried it would be too tight up too but it fit perfectly! I love it so much I'm ordering more in different colors


Good product but returned because it was bit too tight for me; showed too many lines.


I love this dress. Love the material and color. Going to get more in different colors. I brought a  2X.


We bought these dresses for our bridesmaids at our wedding. I gave them a four out of five rating, because some of the busts did not fit the women's chest well. However, with alteration these dresses are amazing. The fabric is thick and durable. Definitely good for something such as a wedding.


Thos was a replacement dress as I previously ordered one and it was too short. I love this one and the other 2 I purchased


this dress is made to perfection. the cut is perfect. even the buttons fit down the chest perfectly.


The top was too loose on me and went too high.  Perhaps someone with much larger girls than I (34A) would have better luck with the top of this fitting well.
