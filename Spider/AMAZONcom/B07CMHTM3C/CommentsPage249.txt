Got a gold one and it's awesome. Not too glittery and so perfect for any occasion


Great dress.


Great product and delivered on time.  Loved the material and look.  Dress was a little to big for my daughter, but she is a small 15 yr old.


I was suprised at how well this dress fit me! I got this dress for an Alphys (from undertale) cosplay. It fits so comfortable that I wear it for casual wear, too :) Altough the dress makes it hard to wear a regular bra, I still love it!


Too long, maybe cause im 5 "2.


Received nothing less of great compliments.  Lovely design and fit


Love this dress. I got so many components. It fits perfectly and is so comfortable.


So cute!!!


Love this dress, and a great price! Fits true and well-stitched. Cute fabric has a little stretch to it, so it hugs curves where you want it to.


Haven't actually worn it yet, it came very wrinkled and I haven't been able to make it look okay, plus it's a little large..
