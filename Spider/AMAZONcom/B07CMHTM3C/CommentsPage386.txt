It runs very small  you need to buy almost 2 sizes bigger I was very disappointed


nice dress it too big


Loved this dress just didn't like the heart buttons.  I returned it just for the buttons.


Very pretty on me a plus size beauty


bad purchase. size all wrong.  measurement advertised are all wrong.


Way to small in the bust area, and I'm not even very busty.....


Super nice dress !!!! In love with it !!!


Fits really well. I usually wear a XL to 1X in shirts and a 16 in pants. I ordered a XL because I wanted the top to fit well. It fits perfect. I'm 5'9" and it hits right at the knees.


Cute


Cute dress and perfect for the occasion. Great thing about it is that I can wear it again. I thought it would be more like a costume but it's not.
