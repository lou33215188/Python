I love this dress.  I am 5'9" and 155 lbs.  I ordered a large and it fits great.  Nice quality for a low price.


Have to get it taken in because it too large around the chest. However, it's quality is spot on and I love the dress.


this fits just right ... so ready to wear it for my disney cruise !!!


The dress fit perfect. Just make sure you print out the measurements take them to your local tailor and have them size you appropriately for the dress. If you  do this the dress will fit perfect I love mine.


I loved the vintage look to this dress but the bust is too big of you don't want to wear a bra. I just lost weight though so that may have been the issue with the bust. I also didn't like the material of the dress. It just felt like paper


Love it, great material and super cute!


I am 5'3 in height. I have two daughters ages 5 and 10 years and they both said I look beautiful felt relaxed and comfortable


Wow, very surprised it's so well made. The fabric is stretchable and thick. Very nice dress. Love the hear shaped buttons.


I could not be more happy with this dress. It fits PERFECTLY!! Just like the old 1950's vintage dresses I used to buy. Super flattering!! (I am curvy, chunky in the middle currently, small chested: like 36A/B, 34 waist, 44 hips). I have pretty big upper arms and the sleeves weren't tight at all like an actual vintage dress. Over all it fits like a charm! I want ten more!!! The material is lightweight but feels like good quality. It was super cute with a cardigan and I imagine it will be cute in the summer without one. I do think that it might be a bit snug on top if you are larger chested, but I saw a pic of someone on Modcloth who wore a tank/cami under it and left the buttons open and it looked equally adorable.


Rough material and fits awkwardly.
