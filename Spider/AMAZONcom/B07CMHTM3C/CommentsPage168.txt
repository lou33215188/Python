Beautiful dress, i should have ordered 1 size larger though. Oh well, incentive to loose weight. It is really pretty.


Beautiful dress especially for the price! It fit as expected and was very comfortable!


Loved the fit and the look!!!!


This dress is very cheaply made. I returned it the second I opened it


I ordered the solid orange dress and I was very dissapointed. It didn't look like the dress on line, the material looked very thin and cheap and the dress was way shorter from the length then I had expected.


looks cheap like off a low budget bargain bin.


Perfect!  It looks so cute. I love the fabric!  I want to buy more colors!


This dress has a small side zipper made of extremely cheap plastic, the toggle broke off just gently pulling the zipper up. So, the dress could not be worn for the intended purpose.


Very sexy and fit as expected


I bought this as a gift for a friend, and it has become a favorite of hers.  Very cute!
