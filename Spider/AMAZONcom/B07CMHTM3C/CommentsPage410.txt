Love it. It fit perfectly, I'm a small small. I love the way the skirt swings with you.


Great material. Just what I expected. Great value.


fit way small and cheaply made.


Adorable retro halter dress. Fit perfectly!


My order was exactly what I wanted


Nice dress but sizing was off.


This dress is fabulous. It fits perfectly on me and the fabric is so comfy.


Pretty, love the material and fit great!


As, posted, it runs slightly smaller than the size suggests, but a very comfortable dress! Design of dress slims in all the right places, and I finally found a perfect length dress for my 6 foot frame!


Was longer than expected.
