I received a lot of compliments on this dress.  It is well made but is a bit tight in the chest/bust area.  Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.


Too long and too large. Feels cheap, looked nothing like the picture


Looks just like picture.


My husband bought me this dress as a birthday gift. It is my favorite dress I own. Fits perfectly and the fabric is nice and thick. Feels like it will last a very long time.


Great!  Machine-washable, great style, great fit... and I received many compliments on it the very first time I wore it (a good sign!).


Adorable dress! However, I gave 4 stars since it's pictured with a belt and it did not come with a belt.


Just as I imagined! Can't quite tie the bow to match the picture but I think it's user error. Also, very tight around the bust, however, I think I'm a bit busty for my size.


Love this dress! I'm 5"7 130lbs and ordered a Small. It's the perfect size and length. It's nice thick stretchy  fabric and very slimming. Not heavy to wear though. Perfect for a vacation, party, wedding, or summer night out! Worth every penny as I am very pleased!


Can't wait to wear this, after I tried it on I just know its going to be fabulous once I set it up w/ the shoes, jewelry, etc.


I purchased this as a gift for my sister, and it was absolutely perfect on her. It may have been a little long, but everything seems long to short people.
