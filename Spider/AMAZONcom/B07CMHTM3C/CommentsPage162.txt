I was really skeptical when I ordered this dress but I was very pleased when it arrived. I received it in the mail about 2 days after I ordered it and was very surprised about the quality of the material. It is nice quality fabric and fits perfectly. Great buy and especially for the cheap price!


Its a pretty dress, not something for my body type, no flaw of the maker, just not something I find for me.


It was a present for my granddaughter. She liked it and said it fit fine!


Perfect fit and looks amazing! I love the style and the color. I would/will order from them again! Love it. Thank you! :D


Wayyyy too small.  Not an American made product and it shows!!!!


Super cute!!!!! Fits poerfectly. I am 5'3", 210 lbs. I ordered a XXL and ii fits perfectly. Love the vibrant color. Material is super comfy.


The dress was on the shorter side and didn't really have that authentic 50's look.


Not too costume-like. Soft and easy to care for. A little longer than expected. But my daughter is 5"4.


Beautiful dress and very flattering. Material is thicker than anticipated and comfortable to wear!


But the length was quite a bit longer than we thought
