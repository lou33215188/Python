Very flattering and fun.  Will be wearing this to a university's Spring Social.  Can't wait!


Awful, see through material -- no return available


Fits PERFECTLY. Was very flattering


This dress is *wonderful.* the sizing chart is accurate, the fabric hangs well, and care is pretty straight forward. I am so happy with it I ordered a second one in another color.


Fits perfectly and I love how it looks on me. Thank you!


My daughter said it fits her perfectly!


Beautiful, and fits just as expected! 5'6 147lbs this dress fit perfect in Medium. Hope this helps future buyers!


The zipper broke immediately. The material on the dress is thin.


Good! Beautiful.


Very cute but a little too tight in the chest if bustier
