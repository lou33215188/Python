Beautiful dress, fits like a glove.  Quality made. Fits like it was tailored just for my daughter.  I'm so impressed I ordered one for myself!


fit as expected nice flow


I like this dress and plan on wearing it more. However, its a litte snug around the waist.


Love, Love, Love, this dress. very comfortable and the material stretches somewhat.


Absolutely love it, normally wear a 14/16 got an XL and it fits perfectly!


Fit perfectly, size as depicted.


This dress due to being a bit stretchy fits perfect! I love it!!!


Love this dress


At least a foot short! VERY cheaply made!  NOT worth even the super cheap price...


Dress fit perfectly. Can't wait to wear it.
