Very well made and I'm happy with the dress


It was a little longer than expected but I'm not complaining


Love love love this dress I wore it with the petty coat slip underneath vintage pump and hair style the whole assumble was breath taking !


clothes were creased. But fit as expected. Color is lovely.


Fit as described!


Cute dress, but the material wrinkles easily.  The bust is also really tight, and I'm pretty flat chested.  I do get tons of compliments on it though!


The dress is good quality although it bunches in the back atop the elastic band requiring slight alterations, but still a great value.


Loved this dress.


Love this dress! Fits perfectly. Beautiful material; well made!


I'm absolutely in love! Can't wait to have everyone's eyes on me at Magic Johnson's gala night in Texas.
