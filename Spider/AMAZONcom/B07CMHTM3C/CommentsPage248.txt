Ordered 2 one white and one orange. This one was cut totally different and smaller than the the white one, and not as roomy. I will return this item.


It was perfect when I wore it then I was not able to wear it anymore after the first wash even if it was on Cold. So I am reamly disappointed.


Fits wonderfully, fabric and stitching feels quality, and is very flattering to my body type. I expect will buy this same dress in another color. Very please.


Happy I had a back up plan. The fabric is unwearable.


Love the dress, just beautiful,  fast delivery.


Thank you


Love this dress!


Super cute. Flattering fit.


Beautiful blue dress. It is a gift to a mother in El Salbrador.  The dress was on the way to her and hope that it fits her well when she puts it on.


Very pretty.


Well-made, thick/durable material, very comfortable.
