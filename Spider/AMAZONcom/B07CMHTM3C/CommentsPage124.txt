I purchased my usual size (large) and it fits perfectly. I am 5'11" and size 10. It hits at  knee length or just an inch under. I wish I had looked better at the pictures because I had intended to wear red shoes with this but, as the pictures show, the rose red is actually a very bright pink. My own fault!


Did not bother to try it on. Was looking for a white dress. This dress is definitely NOT white. It's more of a beige or cream color.


Great costume for my Minnie Mouse look!


I'm pretty short, do this dress was very long on me but fit me right everywhere else. Such a pretty dress. Very comfortable.


It's a nice dress for the price... It definitely shows everything from the back.  So if you have love handles or any body issues you like to keep hidden this is not the dress for you.  It's also a definite "no underwear" dress.  But is otherwise very sexy.


Just the right amount of spandex to get a comfortable fit. I ordered a large, I'm 150lbs and 5 4", fits like a glove.


I really like it & the size is just as listed. It's very comfortable as well. This is a nice dress for the price.


High quality garment that fit perfectly and looks fantastic.  We'll see how it washes, but so far, exceptional for the price!


Cute dress, just snug around the chest area.


It fits slightly large but I am really happy with the dress overall. The material is heavy and thick so no undergarments can be seen through. I'd suggest a thick tulle skirt underneath to add some volume to the bottom.
