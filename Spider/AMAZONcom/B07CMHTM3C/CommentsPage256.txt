I love this dress! Nice quality and fits awesome!


Beautiful dress, great fit. Put a can can slip under it and wore to old Hollywood glam event and was gorgeous.


I love the dress. It's beautiful, and we'll made. It arrived before the date provided.  However, the size I wear was a bit to snug. I intend on returning it. I have already ordered a larger size.


No problems with fit or manufacturing.

Super cute.. Great quality.. Very flattering


I'm 32DD-DDD, 26" waist. I got the small size in red color It's  a very nice and cute dress but it ran some large for me on the waist. The back is too loose. So it looked bad. I'll return it.


The fabric is not bad. The color is pretty.


This dress is gorgeous and very flattering on. It is very comfy. Wrinkles easily.


Dress is so cute. Wore it for an engagement photo and the dress is unique and not over priced. Quality of dress is great it is not made with cheap /thin material.
