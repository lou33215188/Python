Beautiful dress! You could definitely size down since it's stretchy, I didn't even have to open the zipper. It fits wonderfully, I just love it!


I do not usually order clothing online because I have such an odd shaped body and I have had bad luck with getting clothing that actually fit -I am an XL and many times anything that I have ordered online as an XL seems to really fit like a size Medium.  I really loved the way this dress looked in the picture and I o this at a great discount to provide my honest opinion/review so I figured why not try it.  When I opened the package I fell in love with feel of the material it is quite soft.  was pleasantly surprised that there was a zipper on the back to make it easy to put the dress on.  I was really skeptical that it would fit me.  I was able to put this dress on with n problems and since I didn't have anyone at home I had to take the dress off and zip it up and put it back on - again I had not problems getting into the dress!!!  I absolutely love this dress - I have a pouch from having 4 kids c-section and the materials is more spandex like than I l like but I really liked the way the dress sits on me....now I have a dress to use on Friday for my daughters college graduation!!!


I read the reviews and ordered a size larger than I usually wear.  There is a fair amount of stretch to the fabric.  I got the yellow and plan to buy the blue.  The buttons are shaped like hearts (not on all of them, so look close at what you are ordering) and they are SO DANG CUTE. I washed it in cold and put it in the dryer on delicate dewrinkle and it didn't shrink or lose color.  I did not wash the belt, and do not plan to, because they tend to fold and wrinkle weird and I hate to iron. Lol.  it is extremely flattering.  The belt can be worn to the front, to the back (which is cuter I think) or not at all.  It falls just below the knee.  The sleeves are capped but are not restricting to my linebacker sized shoulders.  I would highly recommend this dress.


Wore for st Patrickâ€™s day with a green petticoat and literary got stopped over and over again, was definitely a huge success! The fabric is great, thick but has a good amount of stretch. I took a gamble and bought the size small because itâ€™s my regular size even though I am still trying to loose my post baby weight and still have a good 20 lbs to go and because it was the cheapest. I was able to squeeze my 32waist 38 bust frame into a small- wouldnâ€™t recommend doing that but it speaks to the stretching abilities of the material ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


There was a minor printing flaw in the fabric which was a bummer because it was right on the front in a very visible area, but still awesome


Very, very cute. Slightly stiffer, heavier fabric than most of the Amazon dresses I've ordered, which made it feel a bit like some of my more expensive pin-up dresses. The zipper is about what you would expect from a dress in this price range, not bad, but not super high quality. No belt loops, but the belt stayed in place nicely and was long enough to make a really nice bow. The skirt is between an A-line and a full circle (not quite a full circle). I ordered the large and wear a 34DDD. I have to add a safety pin between the center buttons to fix some minor gaping, but that is typical of almost all of my button down tops and I would not have wanted to go any bigger as the waist would have been too large to cinch.


I'm 5'1" and a 32A and I purchased a small. This dress fits fairly well on me. The waist was only slightly loose but by tying the ribbon it fits snug. The top part of the dress is a bit loose on me but it would fit even better on someone with a slightly larger bust. The material and stitching looks well made and the quality is good.  I'm giving it a 4/5 because I wish they made it in an xs!


Absolutely love this dress, fits perfectly, no need to unzip to put on. For fit reference, I'm 5'3" , 190#, wear a 40DD bra, and ordered the XXL.  Length is below the knee, and I'm wearing a green crinoline to fluff out the skirt, this raised the hem to the perfect length for this style of dress.  I dislike things that tie behind my neck, so I will cross the straps in back and sew on snaps, as I usually do. A wide black belt and a knit green bolero jacket to hide my granny arms, and I have to say that I look fabulous in this outfit, and I don't say that very often. This style is so forgiving and works for a wide range of ages. I just turned 64 years old and this dress doesn't look like I'm "trying to look too young", yet it also works for my daughter and my granddaughters. I get loads of compliments.  Extremely comfortable to wear.


This dress is so, so cute! I bought it to replace another 50's Rockabilly Polka Dot Halter Dress Sundress which I purchased from Amazon in 2009. And I like this new one so much better! It's a comfortable, breathable fabric with just a little bit of stretch to it. I do have a large bust size, and this dress fits perfectly in the chest. It has a zipper under the left arm, not the back as another reviewer had stated. NOTE: Amazon's size chart for this item is totally wrong. Anni Coco has listed their own size chart in the item description, but it was barely noticeable with everything else on the page. I had initially ordered using the Amazon size chart, but fortunately I was able to cancel in time and order the correct larger size.


UPDATE: Upon wearing it once, I discovered that the elastic bunches up weirdly in the back. Dropping my review to 4 stars.


My friend has the red and white polka dot and I fell in love with it but was hesitant.  She had to get a large but she is normally a medium-- 5'3", defined waist, 36B, and a big booty, and it fits her perfect.  I read the reviews and took a chance at an XL based on the measurements and other reviews.  I'm 5'9", 204lbs, but I carry my weight in my belly and I was concerned about the chest of the xxl being too big.  There's elastic in the back and the XL is perfect for me. Just wore it for my 40th birthday in Vegas, so the angle while I'm hugging chewbacca doesn't do the definition on the waist justice


This is a cute, inexpensive polka dot dress. I love the retro look, especially with a petticoat. The fit and fabric were as advertised. It arrived in a nice, protective plastic bag.


There are two issues: there are no hanger loops inside, so you have to figure out how to hang it properly, which is difficult with a halter top. (I used a skirt hanger.) Also, it is not color fast. I bought the red with white polka dots dress, and after first wash, the red dye bled into the edges of the polka dots. It isn't super obvious if you aren't close, but it is disappointing.
