Fits as expected. Dress was a little on the longer side I'm 5'7" and it was 3-4 inches pass my knee. Easy fix for those who like shorter dresses.


Beautiful dress.  Runs slightly small


Wore it for 15 min and zipper broke


Dress was very tight and did not come with the belt it was shown with.


Good quality.


loved this , used it for homecoming but I dont really like the stretchy material


I ordered this dress but it wasn't what I was expecting I initially orderned the x-small dress however I received a small size anyway I still tried it on to see if maybe just out of luck it will fit, well I didnt fit its still too big for me. In addition the fabric was too thin like previous reviewers have said.


The size small fit wonderfully. Its quite wrinkled at the bottom half, but that's to be expected when it's shipped out in the mail lol thick material so I know it's very sturdy and really awesome for such a great price!!!


The dress is sharp to the eye!! Purchased it for my Granddaughter for Christmas!! I know she will love it!! Keeping my fingers crossed it will fit her perfectly!!


I love how this dress fits. The material is great.
