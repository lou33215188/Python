I really love the dress. It was exactly what I expected. I especially love the buttons and the bow. Super cute! :)


very nice


Love the dress. Its a little snug in the chest area. I bought a large. I wear 34d sometimes 36c. Wash in cold water. Do NOT put in the dryer. I had forgotten and now the buttons are screaming for mercy. I will order this dress again but extra large this time.


I love, love, LOVE this dress, but it is just slightly too tight. It's become my goal dress for weight loss, and it has enough give that I can get away with wearing it now, but I wish it didn't pucker so much at the buttons or pinch at the back.


Like this dress.


I washed it only once, before wearing it, and it was a wrinkled mess.....i couldn't wear it at all, I wasted my money, and I didn't return it, because I had washed it before wearing it


It's lovely. However either I'm to busty or its simply too small around the bust. Also I'd like to add that if you expect it to be at the knee or below.. its not. Beautiful color yellow great looking dress just not what I wanted


Materialet cheap


This dress is the perfect summer dress. I normally wear a size 10 and I order the L size. It fits perfectly! The length is also perfect, as it barely touches the floor (I am 5'1") . The fabric is a thick and heavy synthetic mix. It is a great dress for an awesome price.


Very cute dress. Seems like it would be flattering on most shapes.
