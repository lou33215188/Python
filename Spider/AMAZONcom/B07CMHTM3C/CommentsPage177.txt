Really nice dress. Perfect for any occasion.


This is a great dress for the money. The material is a good weight and not flimsy, I'm looking forward to wearing this all summer!


Cute dress but I had the buttons replaced.  They were heart shaped  and cheapened the look.


I ordered a size larger than normal--otherwise it would have been too small. Perfect for dance party.


Love love love this dress! Fits perfectly! I will buy more in more colors soon! Such a great deal for descent quality fabric and construction!


Darling buttons, nice fabric, just the right amount of stretch.


I love the material. Very tight in the mid waist area, which is what I wanted. I love it so much I bought more in different colors.


I normally wear medium or size 6 in dresses. I am 5' 5" 130lbs. 34C-28-40 I bought a large and it fits perfectly. I love, love, love it. Wish they had more dresses like this.


Very cute dress. Great material. Arrived quickly. Perfect 50's dress.


I'm really upset. I'm going to return the dress. I ordered the dress hoping I would be able to wear it for a semi formal event. The dress didn't even come with a belt! I had to wear a different dress. This dress will be returned.
