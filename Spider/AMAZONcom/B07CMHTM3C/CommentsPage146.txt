Super cute!!!! I'm 5'9" and normally about 140 lbs BUT I'm 5 months pregnant and this still fit .. super cute everyone loved it including me and my hubby who was the milkman!!! Nicely made


the picture online looks a lot better than it does in person. i was disappointed


Great dress. I am 5.7 and I order a medium. Fits me perfectly.  I love the dress. Good quality and make me look very sexy


This dress fit beautifully and fabric was great quality! It also had a beautiful flow to it and would look fabulous with an underskirt as well :)


I am not sure how the other reviews ended up with thin material and poor quality because my dress was amazing. The fabric was thick and not see through at all. It is truly a dramatic dress that is so comfortable to wear. I got a ton of compliments from men and women!!


A little tight and very thin,,,,,but a cute design.


I wish there were loops for the belt.


Perfect in every way.


Everything prints out. underwear and bra, can't go bare either because that would be very obvious ....


Awesome.  Color is great, fit was perfect. So much fun!  Can't wait to wear it.


Great quality, beautiful dress.


I'm short waisted and maybe the girls aren't large enough but this style doesn't work for me.


Sadly returning.
