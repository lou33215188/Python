Fits as expected. I don't care of the material but it is still a beautiful dress


Very nice dress! Nice medium heavy cotton. Responds nice to ironing. Beautiful purple color. Would definitely recommend this dress to others.


Order a size larger than you wear. The dress is adorable, sadly it didn't fit me but my daughter loves it


I got this dress today and its sooo freakin cute n it fits me perfectly and love it so much...true to size


Loved this dress. I'm 5'3" and around 150, super pear shaped (gigantic hips, small chest). Medium fit perfect. Looks great with a petticoat underneath it.


Pretty, but fit too big. I


I really love this dress because it is beautiful and stylish but I hate the fact that you can't wear a bra with it .I wear size small in women clothing and I ordered an extra small.


Such an elegant dress! I wore this for my birthday and did not hate being called beautiful all night! I received so many compliments on this dress, and am so happy that I bought it. It fit perfectly and gave off such a classy look!


Order a size larger.  I'm 5'3" and it falls mid calf... perfect for me.  It looks lovely.  A little larger bust than mine would look great, but it's still attractive and was perfect for South American vacation... cool and airy.  A must buy if you are considering this look.


This dress is of excellent quality for the price! The fabric is a good weight, and the garment is well made. My dress was a little bit large in the shoulders and neck area, but that's because I was worried it would be too small and ordered up in size. I am planning to order this dress in another color!
