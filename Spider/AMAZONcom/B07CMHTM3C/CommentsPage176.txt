Nice


Exactly what I expected. Fits well. Inexpensive to buy. Perfect.


Very cute pattern and the colors match the photo on Amazon. I do wish the material was softer though!


I was a bit worried after I ordered because when I looked back at the sizing chart, I should have ordered a larger size. I'm 5'6 and 160lbs. The dress fit perfectly! The cotton is thick with stretch. No bunching anywhere. It fell right to my ankles. Not too short or too long. I love it.


Plus it shipped and arrived right on time.


I bought this dress as a gift for my daughter. She loved it.  I used the size chart to help with getting the right size and the dress fit perfectly.


My wife loved it. Nice details with the buttons, pockets and material. Size fit perfectly!


Love, love, love this dress!!  Wore it to a professional conference and received a ton of compliments on it!


cute and comfy!


This is a real dress, real material and real fit!  I am very pleased with the dress and I am going to wear it well on my cruise.  It was somewhat large but I ordered up thinking it would be too small, so you should order your true size.  This is my first review because I love this dress! I will add pictures when I am all dolled up!


I bought it for someone and it fits very well... I don regret my money ğŸ˜‰
