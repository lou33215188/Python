It was a little bit big and the fabric wasn't what I was expecting but it works for my needs. It is a pretty dress.


Love it


My daughter loves it


Fits great!


I just got it for a Fran Bow cosplay and it is wonderful


The dress is amazing and came in a timely fashion. Sizing is always an issue with different sellers but all in all I am happy with the dress.


Girlfriend was stopped in Brooklyn to have her picture taken while wearing this. 5 out of 5.


Dress wasn't exactly for me, but it looked good on the girlfriend. :) A size down might fit a little nicer, but great print and colors!


LOVED IT!!!!


Once we got the wrinkles ironed out if looked great.  Fit great and delivered as advertised.
