It fits great, and is now one of my wife's favorite dresses.


It fit really good my only complaint if I had one is the fabric


It was good fit, very fast delivery


It fit perfectly except fro my shoulders, they were a little too big. I have narrow shoulders


Loved the dress but chest is too tight.  Ordering larger size.


Very short. Dresses this one is modeled after were at the knee or a little past it.  Not the case with this one.


I am a 5'7" c cup big booty girl and this dress compliments every curve. I am going to wear it as is with no petticoat to my rehersal dinner for my wedding.


The dress is a beautiful blue, fits well and is a much heavier fabric than what some reviewers described - I'm very pleased.


also return it


The dress was of good quality but was much longer in length then I like.  Returned item.
