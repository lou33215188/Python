This one is perfect,  luv it


Love it and now others do too!


A little tight across the chest but nicely fitted bodice. Lovely print and vibrant colors.


So comfy and so beautiful. I want to wear it all the time!


I love this dress, the meterial and quality is excellent. I had to return it back but I really liked it


The color and look is just as expected.  This is good for a petite frame.  Love it!


I ordered a med, then returned it for a small.


I love this dress! I worse it to my bridal shower and it was perfect!


The dress is very beautiful it fits me nicely..I'm 4'9 I ordered medium..I'm very happy of this dress this one of my favorite..


I am between a medium and small so I bought a medium just to be safe. I'm not sure who they think this dress will fit but it is so tight I can't even pull it over my body. Way too small!


The dress is better quality than expected. Fits well and hand washed well.
