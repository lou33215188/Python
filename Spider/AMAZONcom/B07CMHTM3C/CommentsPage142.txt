I love the dress! However I do Not use the bow as I dislike it. But the dress is high quality. And nicely made.


I am 5'1 and 160 pounds the xl fits perfect and sits about 3 inches under my knee. I'm totally smitten will be buying other colors!


I super love this dress! Very feminine, vintage and flattering. It's a favorite.


Super cute. Much better quality than I was expecting for the price. Can't wait to dress it up and go out on the town.


I love it!!!!! Although it does do a weird ruffle in the elastic on the back. I am not really sure how to explain it. It fits amazing and isn't as low cute as I feared. I am doing a few alterations to make the dress perfect for me . I am adding a big ribbon in the middle and changing it from a halter top to straps. Overall I am very pleased with the dress.


Bought the dress for my wife on a whim. Fit well and looked great, will be looking at other products in the future.


Received many compliments when I wore this dress. Fits great, have spent double the amount on dresses that were the same quality.


Thin, not good quality, button came off in my hand while I was un-buttoning the dress to try it on, missing the belt....


Cheap fabric you can see thru and a button fell off when I tried it on. Button obviously not a big deal but be prepared to wear a slip.


Adorable, perfect fit.
