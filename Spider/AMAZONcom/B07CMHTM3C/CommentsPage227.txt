The dress was bought for my Wife as a gift. and she was pleased with the way it fits and we all know Happy Wife Happy life . I will be purchasing  more dresses in the future


Order a size up if you have thicker arms and chest.


This dress exceeded expectations. I ordered it for a Halloween costume, but it's so nice that I'll wear it for other occasions!


Beautiful


I was very wary of buying a dress online but it fit perfectlyâ€‹ and is well-made. I love it!


Fits perfect


its beautiful


Cute go to dress that's slimming, yet doesn't make your hips feel like they belong in the ocean.  Available in many solid, flattering colors, that can easily be paired with a cute scarf!  Cute for winter with an undershirt, leggings, and booties, IMHO.


Loved this dress, it was perfect for a 40's themed party! I used a wide belt and petticoat to add to the final look


CUTE!
