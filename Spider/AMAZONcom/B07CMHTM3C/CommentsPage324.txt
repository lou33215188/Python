Wore it to a wedding and loved it !


love the dress its just not for busty people like myself


Dress was too short


It's a very beautiful dress, but it was way smaller than descibed.


What a cute dress!  I love it!


Very strange fit. Felt cheap. Did not wear.


Great love it


It is kind of large and longer than I expected but love it!!


It fits perfect and accentuates my curves amazingly!


Love ❤️ it
