Love the quality and size.  Ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.  I wear a size 8-10.


Great dress! Used it for Halloween costume as Marilyn Monroe. Many compliments!


It's perfect I just should of got a size smaller. It's very comfortable and can move around easy! And for the money it's amazing.


Absolutely Loved this dress and how it fit,but the


Zipper keep getting stuck,and wouldn't allow me to zip it up'


Ordered it for A Womens Day dinner,and ended up with no dress.


Really cute N' fun looking =)


It's tiny and the material is really really thin and cheap.


I returned this. Giving it three stars still cuz it was nice, just really long!


Beautiful workmanship. It fits like a dream.  My daughter is so happy with this dress.  I can't approve enough!


When it arrived it looks cream and not white.


Cute style, however material was cheap, reminded me of a table clothğŸ˜�
