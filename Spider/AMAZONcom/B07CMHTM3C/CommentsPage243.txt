Great dress, very comfortable. I get lots of compliments when I wear it.


I love this dress, but it runs very small.


Fit was great.


I like the fit but it wrinkles horribly. looks cute.


I loved this dress. No complaints here. Everywhere I went people complimented it. Good material.... accurate fit.


This dress is cheaply made. Does not fit well at all. Very thin material. Don't waste your time waiting on this,dress to arrive,as I'm sure you will return quickly and you will have to wait for the seller to send your a return lable.


The dress was cut really weirdly. I wasn't necessarily too small, but rather cut unflatteringly high around the neckline with a sweetheart cut that went too far up the neck.


An adorable yest sext summer hit spot dress,


Great dress.  Material is nice.  It should be a good summer dress.  I purchased the black.  I will likely purchase in additional colors.


very nice dress
