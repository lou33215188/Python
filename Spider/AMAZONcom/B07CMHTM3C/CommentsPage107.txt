This dress is FABULOUS! Fits great, comfy, and easy to move around in. Will definitely buy more from this seller!


This dress is so amazing!!! It fit a little smaller than I expected but the cut of the design made it appealing. The material is heavy enough to wear in fall/spring but light enough to wear in summer. It is very feminine and will transfer from day to night with minimum accessory adjustment. I'm ordering more!


I am very happy with this purchase! It of course needed an ironing after being shipped, but it's a great 50's dress, just added my crinoline. The fit is great.


delivery was awesome.  The dress is slightly on the bigger size.  The material is stiff and hard to get the wrinkles out.  Not as much flair as I was hoping.  But its a very cute dress.


I love this dress.  I ordered a size up to get the extra length, but will have it taken in around the waist.  I am 5'11" and typically wear a size 10 or 12.  I ordered the XL, trying to get the length to just below my knee.  The quality is very good for the price.  The fabric has a good bit of stretch to it.  I am pleased with the dress and will likely order the red/white.


This dress is amazing! I bought the yellow mustard version. I'm 5'5 and 145 and it fits perfect. It's made of a thicker fabric so it hangs great. I wore it to a wedding a got lots of compliments. I plan on buying more in other colors.


It is suuuch a cute dress! I bought it for a costume and it worked so well. I'd wish I'd bought a petticoat to go underneath it though.


cute dresses!!! It is a little shorter than what I wanted but it is supppppeeerr cute!!!!!


This dress looks cute in pictures but not so much in real life. The fabric is stiff and very see through. Perhaps after a washing, it might soften up but it can not be worn without a slip.


This dress is great
