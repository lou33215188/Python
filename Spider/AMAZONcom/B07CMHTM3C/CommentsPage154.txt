Great dress, fit a little tighter than expected, but still fit. 4 stars because it was FAR shorter than expected. WELL above my knees. To be fair, I'm 5'11, but bending over was almost like giving a free show... Overall though, this dress was great. Well made and nice fabric.


Beautiful, and they fit but I should have sized up!! They arrived intact and on time.


Perfect dress perfect price


This dress would be great for a really nice costume but the material is a bit cheap for a nice dress.


Ordered the 2x. Maybe a bit tight in the bust but I'm a 42d so that may have been the cause. Doesn't fan out like the picture but fits true to size and feels sturdy. Purchased as a bridesmaid dress. Also neck straps are very thick.


I really flat like a queen


Love this dress! Fits perfectly and has a bit of stretch to the fabric.


I love the way the dress fits, I didn't realize the belt is separate from the dress and it is a little stiff but I am very satisfied.


I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. I have a very similar style from a much more expensive, retro themed website and they fit exactly the same. The arms are a little tight, and the bust is a little small, but nothing that I can't work with. Overall, great dress for the price. The mustard yellow is gorgeous!


Great Quality. I am 5'6, 118 pounds and the size small fit great. A little bit roomy in the chest but I only wear a 34C so I wasn't surprised.
