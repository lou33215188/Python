Love, love, love it!


Ordered a size larger and fit perfectly. Very pretty and flattering dress for a woman with curves.


Purchased a Med. Too small. To fit it would have to have been an extra large. I returned it. The style was great. Fabric was here nice, not flimsy.


Love it!


Very cute dress but the medium was HUGE and very long.


Size was a perfect fit. It was comfortable and and gained a lot of compliments.


Very elegant and sexy


Im usually a size "10", and bought a Large


It fits perfect!!


Very comfortable and classy!


I returned for a larger size. Cute dress made with a great fabric. Runs a bit small.


This dress was as expected.Â
