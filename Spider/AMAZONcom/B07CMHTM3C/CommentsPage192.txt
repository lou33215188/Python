I bought a large , but it was too small I had to return it


Fast shipping that I can guarantee! The dress is very cute and sexy! I'm 5'2 height, 113lbs and I order small.. I tried it on and still big specially the top. I give 4 stars because the dress is very cute, good material. I tried to exchange the size but the company said, they can't. Just give it to your friends or family that will fit. So my husband said he'll buy me the xtra small and forget about exchanging cuz to much process. But in afraid again what if the top is to big again or loose like I have right now. So I decided to just take it to the tailor and fix it. Over all, I love the dress. So my advice, is if your Asian or skiny get x- small...

I wore the dress for the debut of my new business. I got so many compliments on it. I have 3 now, waiting for a big sale so I can buy more!


pretty dress


The perfect  size and color


Love the way this dress fits. It’s very flattering. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because the zipper was broken. I am exchanging for a new one.
