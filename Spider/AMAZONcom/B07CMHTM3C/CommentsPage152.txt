This was for a Halloween costume but I ended up not using it.  I could have used it as a regular dress in the spring or summer but decided to send it back for now.  Might re-order in the Spring!!


This is a lovely dress.  It fits like a glove.  I little difficult to get on and off but once it's on it fits great!


Perfecto!  I was worried about the quality, because the price was so reasonable.  It is extremely well made and fit beautifully.


A little snug around the arms, but I was expecting that. I really enjoyed the dress. It was the first one I'd worn in over ten years. I'm looking forward to checking out similar styles in the future.


Very thin material and very cruelly shows away all the bumps and flabs. Not for anyone who is even a little curvy. This is a nice dress for a really thin ,really in good shape person.Plus there was a stain on the right butt area. Because of all these reasons, returning it.


This dress looked amazing on me at the ball. At the end of the night I noticed I had a small hole at the seam of the dress.


5' 10" at 165lbs and the large fit like a glove! Tons of compliments so I ordered another color :) the heart buttons are the cherry on top! This dress was on another site for twice the price plus shipping, happy I came across it here!!


This was for my daughters homecoming. She loved it and looked great!!!!


Nice cut,  cute design.  Not very fibbing in the bust.  Fit true to size.


Wow I love love love this dress! It fits like a glove and is just beautiful! Going to buy more colors!
