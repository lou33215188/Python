I really like this dress. It runs a bit small in the chest. If in doubt, order a size up.


Dress is made in costumer material (shiny and stretchy).


Nice


Nice dress, looks great, fits well


Dress is much longer than expected and fits a bit big.  After washing the fabric is difficult to iron/steam as it wrinkles quite badly.


This is a very short dress. Short enough to be a shirt.


Beautiful dress! Looks studding! I am 5'6", 130 lbs, 32D. Medium fist perfectly.


This dress is perfect! I checked my measurements before ordering and could not have asked for a more perfect fit. Great quality at a great price.


This dress is absolutely awesome..so much so that I ordered it in different colors. my specific issue is that I've been working out  and it did not fit the same when it was time to wear the dress. I will be ordering the next size down and hopefully it will arrive before Graduation! it really is nicely made.


wow I LOVE This dress. the fabric is so stretchy and soft. and the fit is just amazing. I normally wear a 12-15 so I went with a 2XL, I did pair it with a cute black peti which just really made the dress pop... it does need ironing.
