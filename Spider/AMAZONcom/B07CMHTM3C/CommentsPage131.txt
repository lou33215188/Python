I bought a XXL knowing that the dress ran very small.


Please let me know when you will have the white available.


Was pretty confident this dress would not fit my 5'10 curvy bod, and it fits awesome and is completely adorable! Love it!


Although this dress was extremely pretty. It was far too large for me and they don't sell an extra small. So sadly it was returned. So for any girl that's a 33.5 and 25 waist on the petite size be wearily this dress may not fit you


Pretty dress and can be dressed up for a wedding or black tie event. It's a bit short though and the straps weren't properly stitched so I ended up returning it. I'd buy it again if it weren't for the fact that I found another dress for the wedding I had. I'm 5'5, 130lbs, 36D and got a medium.


It's got thick fabric but the zipper is absolutely crap. Breaks all the time.


This dress was exactly what I was looking for.  The material is a nice thickness and weight. The edges on the waist ribbon and detailing were very well done. As a size 14/16, but with a smaller chest and broad shoulders, I expect a looser fitting front and tighter back but this was perfect all the way around.  The sleeves allowed for full arm movement as well. I may buy this dress in additional colors in the future. Love It!


I loved this dress. It is perfect and I will recommend to my friends and family!

I love this dress. It is flattering and the color is beautiful, though it's a brighter red than the picture.
