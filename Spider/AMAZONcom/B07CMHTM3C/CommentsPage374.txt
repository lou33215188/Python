I like the material and the fit.


After reading almost all the reviews on this dress before ordering, I decided to get a size larger. I must say I am able to wear undergarments, and a waist trainer without the seams showing. The material is light and you couldn't see through it when I went outside or indoors. I am incredibly pleased with this dress and just know it will get many flattering compliments when worn.


I love my dress! Not only was it perfect for my friend's Alice in Wonderland bridal shower  (I was Alice) but my hubby loves me in it too! Only wish there wouldn't have been a hole in the back of the dress where the skirt meets the top. I can fix it, but wish I didn't have too. Otherwise I love love love this dress! So beautiful on and it made me feel so pretty!
