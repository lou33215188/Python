Love it so much!!!


Nice fit. Seems to be well made.


The dress is very pretty and the fabric is nice. It fit well but was a little longer than I thought. I will have it hemmed and it will be perfect. Was able to wear without a bra which was nice!


too long. I'm 5'2


a nice universal use outfit.  Can be used retro, beachie outtings, or casual summer.


Super cute dress, great quality and fit!


Huge bust and a tiny waist.  If you have a small chest like me (34B), don't attempt this dress.  It is fitted and definitely made for the larger ladies.


It was just what I had in mind when I ordered this product! I couldn't be happier!


Fits wonderfully! Make sure you order according to sizing chart. Great material too!


Fit great, just what we wanted!
