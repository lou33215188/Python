I love this dress and have gotten compliments when I wear it


My sons girlfriend loved it so I bought her one in red too


Zipper broke trying it on right out of the mail


I love the material,  the dress is a little short,  I'm 5'8 so I need to use a slip but otherwise it's a very flattering dress.


Good quality. Good fit. I'm 5'2 120 lbs 32DDD 25in waist.


I purchased a small. Dress falls below my knees.


Got a lot of compliments in this dress!


I really did want to like it.....but 2 things stopped me. First the middle is a bit tighter then I would have liked. Even after reading the sizing guide. Normally I would just return it and get a size up, but no, because of the second thing. IT WAS ALREADY WORN! I took it out of the plastic to see white powder in areas, which had a light perfume smell. Now, if only one or the other problem was there, I wouldn't fault it. I can always wash it, or as I said return it. But the two together? Sorry no. I am sure this is an amazing set of dresses, and I am a bit disheartened I couldn't use it, but buyer beware, you might want to really wash the dress before you wear it.


This dress is perfect !!! Lots of compliments too. :)


Very nice quality but I'm 5'3 113lbs and the small was too roomy


Love it! Great fit!


Loved the dress and the material was not thin which is a plus. Received lots of compliments
