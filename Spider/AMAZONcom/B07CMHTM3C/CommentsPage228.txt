It was nice but I ordered the small which fit me but way to small in the boobs. If I got a size bigger to fit my boobs the dress would be to big ecerywhere else


This is super cute! Nicely made and very flattering. I plan to wear it on my upcoming Disney trip with some mouse ears :) I'm 5'3", 120lbs, C/D cup - I ordered a small and it fit well!


The dress is perfect.  I would recommend that anyone that get it. Make sure you get a size bigger. Because my daughters an XL and I got her XXL. It fits perfect. No flaws nothing. We are one happy customer.

It's beautiful, just to small in the top area


Love the dress but waaaay too long! It's made for tall people!


Button fell off before I could even put it on.


Came sized much smaller than expected. Dress is a very lightweight material. The next size up was sold out so I gave the dress to my friend, as I can get no use out of it.


I love this dress! I am 5'8"/160lbs with a muscular build and normally wear a dress size 6 or 8. The medium fit me perfectly.


Omg! ^_^ i love this dress! It took me a while to make the actual purchase as i was afraif it wouldn't fit. But it fits perfectly! The zipper got stuck though :( but i don't mind switching it out for a stronger zipper :)


Over all, great dress and very good material
