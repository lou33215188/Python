dress was pretty, sizing runs small, had to return


Not what it expected; to be the color was off white when its stated white and it was r cut smaller than anticipated/


Great


It's really beautiful but the smallest breast size is a 34 and I'm a 32. So it would fold out in the middle. I had a friend of mine tailor it to my size but still sucks that I had to spend a little extra. Other than that I love the dress it's very beautiful


Just love it! Love the heavy and stretchy material!  I hope all their products are like this one.


Very  cool, My woman  Love it.


Adorable


I absolutely love my dress exactly how it looks on the picture or even  more beautiful!! I will Definitely be ordering more


I purchased the smallest size and it was still way too big. Had to have it altered to fit me (I'm 5'6" and 125 lbs). But i like the style


Exactly as described; glad I found your listing for this dress. I wanted to buy the same style from another site and it was $45 more !
