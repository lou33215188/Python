I was hoping to wear this dress to a summer wedding but the material looked too cheap


Dress fits nicely its just a lot longer than expected and I'm 5'9


Top of dress above waist too long.  Not a flattering fit, at all.  Made for a less curvy figure.


Love this but didn't realize it had large pleats under the bodice.  Not the most flattering but overall I felt good in this dress.


My daughter put the dress on a mannequin in her room and loves the display


Pretty dress! It's well made and true to the picture.  However, the sizing is slightly large. Nothing a few alterations can't fix :)


The dress fit perfectly. Took my measurements then compared to your site. Will work perfectly for event it was ordered for and beyond!


Very nice dress


I absolutely love the dress it fits perfectly!


somewhat small
