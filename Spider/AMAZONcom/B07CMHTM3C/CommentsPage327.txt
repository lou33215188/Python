Wonderful  dress, ordered 2 sizes I kept the medium


I ordered a size 16 but still is small .


perfect Marylin Manroe Halloween Costume!


Love this dress!!!!


The description stated that the dress material is 96% cotton - not a chance.  It felt more like 100% synthetic.


I got this for my daughter who loves this style. She loved it. it was well worth the cost.


Too long


Not the material I was hoping for. Reminded me of plastic :/


Fit great and was SO adorable. I got so many compliments!


But unfortunately, the zip wasn't sown very well. The nut on the zip came out even before I could wear it. So sadğŸ˜¢. Now I can't even wear it
