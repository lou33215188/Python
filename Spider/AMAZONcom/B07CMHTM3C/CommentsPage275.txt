I Love the way  the  dress  fair  out ,so  old  fashioned  !  Makes me Look  and feel wonderful


I  feel  pretty  !


Thank you  so much  !


The Dress was way too small. I will pass it on to someone that it will fit... however it was very disappointing because it was purchased for a wedding.


Will work perfect for my halloween costume


I bought a size down based on reviews and it was still too large - really cute but just didn't fit. I will pass it on to a friend rather than return


LOVE this dress. The way it fits is amazing and I get a ton of compliments.


I lover my dress and get complimented everywhere I go in it on it.


It's beautiful,  but more like a juniors 2x than a women's.  I ordered this to wear to my Brothers funeral.  Luckily I requested expedited shipping,  so now I can go find something.


dont buy if you have any boobs


I look absolutely adorable in this. I can't wait to go swing dancing.


Really flattering cut, comfortable with elastic at sides and flattering neckline.  Wore it with petticoat, white bobby socks and red tennis shoes for a 50's party and got lots of compliments
