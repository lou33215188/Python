Very nice product ! I happy with my dress , it fits as expected. It was a lil longer but it's ok


I love the dress but I didn't know I had to buy a tutu for under it to make it puff. I thought it would just be like that cause that's what the picture displayed. I returned it.


This dress was perfect. Lightweight material.  Came exactly as it looks.


This dress fit as expected and I was pleased with the fabric and style of this dress. I relied on the comments to decide on the size of dress I should order because I know certain companies makes clothes differently but I wear an XL and that is what I ordered and I was glad I did. It is exactly as the picture. I got several compliments on the style of this dress.


I'm 5ft 4.5, 135lbs, hour glass and this dress fit perfectly! No need for heels on my end. It's cold now but I'm sure this will be my favorite maxi in the summer!!!

Absolutely gorgeous! The material is nice and thick and it fit really good.


Runs small, nice material too short for tall lady


Fits me perfect and it looks like I stepped out of the 50's ...awesome. I love it.


Super cute! I ordered a medium since I am 5'6'' and 155 lbs. This dress fit as expected and I receive a ton of compliments!
