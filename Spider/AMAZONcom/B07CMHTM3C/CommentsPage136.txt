My 12yr old daughter is wearing in her play at school, Bye Bye Birdie.. It fits great just the bust is a little big, but its a great dress, great quality, and great price.  Would purchase again.


Gorgeous got loads of compliments  It was a nice surprise cos I was concerned about it fitting and it turned out great


love the dress. Material is great quality. My only problem was the sizing but, better too big than too small...I can easily bring it in for adjustments.


Exactly what i wanted and couldn't have been better timing as a gift for my wife who showed up that afternoon with a 50s style haircut i wasn't expecting. Great dress she loves it ty.


I love it however it is a little tighter in the bust area than I would have liked.. But I am keeping it!


Ordered the dress on the large side according to the size chart and it fits perfectly! Love it


Love this dress. Can't wait to wear it. I think it looks better tied on the back.  I purchased the grey with black but love that there is so many colors to choose from. I'm might also order the purple with white. Don't hesitate to order this dress you'll love it.


very small.  may work for you if you have an 'A' sized breast cup.  Lost of cleavage for a B cup.  Forget it if you are C cup or larger...


Bought this for my 12 year old daughter...it is just gorgeous and she look very cute.


I love it, fits exactly how it should
