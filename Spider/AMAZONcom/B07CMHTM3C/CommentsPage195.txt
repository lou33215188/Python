Absolutely love the light weight material . Well made.


Beautiful dress


Too large for me.  Thought I would like the halter as well but a B cup and it looked way too big in me.


For the price, this is a great dress. I found the sizing to be spot on. Despite my extra-inflated pregnancy boobs, it stayed buttoned and comfortable during an outdoor wedding. Would absolutely buy again in another color!


very attractive. comfortable to wear.


Really good quality! I wash it cold and hang it to dry, but sometimes my roommate throws it in the dryer when he's trying to get his own laundry done, and it still looks fine! I wear this about once a week, and I always receive compliments on it. I've ironed it. Both a warm and cool iron work on this dress, plus I've used steam before. The only problem is that it wrinkles really easily, but it also irons really easily, so I guess that is not much of a problem! It came with a few loose strings, especially around the heart-shaped buttons, but they were non-essential. The tie around the waist is really long! I can wrap it around myself twice and still tie a pretty good bow (32" waist). Normally, I wrap it once to get a nice, big bow in the back or front, wherever I decide to tie it.


I bought quite a few red dresses in this style, including another Anni Coco but this one work and is very flattering!


Gorgeous extremely flattering dress! Definitely recommend!


I bought this dress to wear to a black and white gala.  It is not the most high quality dress but looked great and was perfect for the price.  HOWEVER, after washing this dress, PER INSTRUCTIONS, the colors bled horribly and left the white panels medium gray and streaky.  This one's going in the trash now :(


love the fit awesome
