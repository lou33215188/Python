Awful. The polka dots are way to big and it looks and feels cheap


1st dress I've ever bought online. I took my measurements, followed their size chart upon ordering, was very worried it wouldn't fit but was relieved & pleasently surprised when it arrived & fit perfectly. And it's super cute with those heart shaped buttons. I love it!


Went by the size chart, I normally order small, but since my bust and hips matched the medium I ended up ordering the Medium. Package arrived and anxiously I tried it on. Chest fit perfectly but mid-drift and hips are a little tight. Took a few minutes but I was able to squeeze out without any problem. Can not wait to wear this dress out on my dates.


Little  disappointing. Size runs small even for petite. Photo was a little misleading. Fabric is not as substantial as it appeared. Would not buy another.


had to return it runs small. Really wanted it to fit love the dress


Too large, zero support really, I was not hoping for a ton of support, but some. I ordered a small, I am a 30F. So, yeah, returned it.


I wore this dress to a bbq over the weekend and OMG it's beautiful. I got so many compliments from both males  and females. I would highly recommend it.


The material is good but the size is too big for asian girl. I need to bring it to the tailor to make it smaller. I wish they have extra small.


Looks cheap. Way too tight in bust.


Dress is too cute for words! May order in other colors because I absolutely love it. Item shipped and received quickly too.
