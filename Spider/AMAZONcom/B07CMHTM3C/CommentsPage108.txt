Great fit. Great cut. The fabric is a bit rough and not as stretchy or smooth as I'd imagine. The fabric does need to be ironed, but color and fit are great!


Very pretty dress and made well. I am a size 14-16 and the XL fit perfectly. Needs ironing out of the package. Highly recommend this dress for a 50's retro flair.


This dress is adorable. I plan to get black and green too.


Just beautiful dress! I'm 5'6 and this dress goes just past my knees. Fabric is soft and stretchy, not stiff. I would buy this dress in every color! Anni coco makes great vintage dresses, if you can't decide which brand, choose this one it's quality.


If your big breasted you may have to get a size larger than normal, as it wont zip easily. The design for the dress is meant to be tighter so keep that in mind also.


It was way too big. And, a bit of dissappointment.


Beautiful, well-made dress. It's a much brighter, cheerier yellow in person, but other than that it's as described. I love it.


Cute! Added a black ribbon for a sash and black petticoat for the poof.


This dress is lovely but I should have ordered one size up as my regular size was a bit tight.  Otherwise, I intend to order a couple more colors.


LOVE!


Order 1 size smaller.


Will, fer sure, be back!
