Loved the dress. It was a huge hit at my party. Fits great,  and definitely a classic style. I am a size 16, and it looked fabulous.


This dress is very cute and wore well.  The heavy cotton fabric was able to stretch where I needed it to but do follow the vendor's size chart.  It did require a lot of ironing but stood up to a long day in the car and at the outdoor public event for which it was purchased.


Amazing!


Have a few dresses from them now and never disappointed. Sized right,great length,good quality.


I think this dress is very adorable. I wore it twice so far and not kidding I got probably 9 or 10 compliments and people asking me where I got it. My measurements are 43 bust 38 waist and 45 hips and I got an XL. It fit perfectly although I think it sort of stretches a little after being washed but not noticable. Its also very long. It goes to probably mid shin. I think the dress is definitely worth the cost if not more and its definitely the cutest thing I own!


cute dress and good quality. it fits a little tight in the rib cage. otherwise I like the stretchy material.


Great fit! Love the style ! I suggest buying the slip to go with it underneath! But does come very wrinkled but for the price and the fitting chart match perfect


My step daughter loved it.


Adorable


I love this dress!  It fit like I wanted and I am going to recommend this manufacturer
