The dress itself is a great quality and looks exactly like the photo. It runs a bit small though. I'm 5'4'' and 120 pounds/slim. It fit perfectly length wise but is a little tight.


Super cute in summer and I also turned it into a Belle costume on halloween!


I have received so many compliments on this dress.  I really love it!  The price was great also.


To small is an understatement.


It would have fit a small 12 year old maybe.


Beautiful dress. Nicely made. Too small in the bust.


I love this dress.  The material feels great and does not look cheap.  It's a great style and the price can't be beat. My only complaint...I ordered an XXL (not my usual size) because of the size chart and it was way too big.  I sent it back for an XL (my usual size) and it fit perfectly.


I love this dress. Very Comfortable and had lots of compliments as well as being told I looked like Mimi mouse..lol But it looks great. Love it


This dress was even nicer then I expected, it was a little stiff so I soaked it in fabric softener and it became much softer. I love the fabric because it's thick enough it doesn't look cheap and super flattering. I would recommend it.


Compared to other dresses I have ordered this one runs a little large, but I prefer it being a little loose instead of being squeezed in.  The length is perfect and the fabric is just the right weight.


PERFECT. ORDERED A MEDIUM AND FITS PERFECT. THESE ARE MY MEASUREMENTS. GREAT QUALITY AND SLIGHT STRETCH. GOES BELOW MY KNEES WHICH I LOVE
