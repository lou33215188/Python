Not what I expected.  The dress is beautiful but it is not long on me. But I will keep it.


Cheap fabric, but you get what you pay for. I didn't want to pay much.


Packaging and delivery great. My dress is cute and sassy and fits.


Fits perfect! Long enough about floor length and it seems I can still wear heels and I'm 5'8 and a thicker woman with long legs. Nice material not too fancy not too casual! Perfect for a dinner date or cruise trip! I tried it on with a waist trainer still looks ok may where with a slip but it looks just like the picture color and style perfect! Such a plus it came with a garment bag! Beautiful dress and perfect for occasion slimming and pretty on curves


For me it was a little bigger then I expected but it was cute and worked for the event I needed it for.


Sending it back! But the quality of the material is good.


I really like this dress cuz it fits right and it's cute. I'm a happy buyer here.


No good after you wash it.  Wear it once & toss.


5'3" 139 lbs 36 DDD and this size fit perfect and the buttons are not struggling to stay closed at my chest which is great!!! Got so many complements on how I looked


only made for very small or skinny girls.
