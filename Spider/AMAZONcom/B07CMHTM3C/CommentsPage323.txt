Loved it


Dress was lovely but didn't fit well (too large). But there were no XS.


I am returning this dress because it was too big in the arm area


Love it!  I received a lot of compliments ğŸ‘�


This color is not white as per the description it is  cream.and the dress too short.


Love the dress, style and fit.


Beautiful!


Too short, not even knee length. When I saw the name Modest I thought somewhat covered.


This dress is beautiful I love it.


Love the dress it looks amazing on
