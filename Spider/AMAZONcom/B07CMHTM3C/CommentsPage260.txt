Nice dress.


The dress is short. The back is see thru. I wish it was slightly longer. Don't buy if you're taller than 5'5


Love this, very comfortable, love the material and a very flattering dress.


Love this dress I normally wear medium so based on reviews I bought large it fits perfect


Was not long enough and too small


Fit is perfect. Fabric quality is awesome, wasn't what i was expecting... in a good way! Very comfortable, would buy from this store again!


So sweet on! Very flattering fit and the material is wonderful.


Absolutely perfect â™¡


Daughter Loves it - for her 8th Grade Graduation!


Purchased for my daughter, Perfect fit and fabric is great!
