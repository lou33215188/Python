Super cute ,comfy ,modest,but sexy dress!


It's very nice


Material is only shortfall, like cheap sheets.  But for the price, it's expected.


Too small, and was delivered a week after the delivery time

large fit perfect. nice and long dress. i bought it to use as my tiffany wedding dress.(bride of chucky)


It was a nice dress better made than I was expecting. It was delivered quickly, the price was right, and it looked adorable. Overall I was pleased no complaints here.
