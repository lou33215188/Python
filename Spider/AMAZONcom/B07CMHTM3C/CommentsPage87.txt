This dress is amazing! I am 5'3, 150, DD - I ordered a Large and it fit perfectly. It is really well made and has durable material. I wish I would have ordered a petticoat separately to complete the look, but it was still great without it. Highly recommend!


I really loved this dress but it was too small in the bust for me. It is also quite long so I would of had to have it hemmed. It went to right above my knee. For reference I am 5'4, 115 lbs and 36D.


returned.  slightly small and all the buttons popped off when I tried it on... not from trying to squeeze on a dress that doesn't fit, they just straight up weren't attached properly.  it looks better online.


Nicely fitted in the waist and not too flared along the skirt. Very pretty details and comfortable feel


Very nice casual dress, fits great! But as I expected, it was still a tad too long for me as I'm a tiny 5'2" so I have to alter most of my maxi dresses haha .. other than that great dress


So I gave a 4 star instead of a five star because this dress came dirty I thought that the marks on the white area of the dress were stains but once I washed the dress they were gone aside from the marks the the dress fit perfectly and looks beautiful I received many many compliments some people wanted to know we're I purchased it so they can purchase it as well


Its a very cute dress, but the buttons popped off on it within 2 wears. The belt doesn't add much to it so I use it as a matching headband. Its not bad, but it's definitely not great.


This is a very beautiful dress. Fits well. Good material that covers.  Great price. Really happy with this purchase. Thank you!


I wish this fit because the color (purple) was really saturated and pretty. Fabric had a good stretch too it. Buttons were not sewed on well but for the price had it of fit I would have just resewn them myself. worth a try


It was too big. A small fit like a large. Kind of disappointed
