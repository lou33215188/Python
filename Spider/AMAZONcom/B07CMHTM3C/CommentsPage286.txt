I ordered xlarge.  Bust size 41 waist 35.... fits like a glove.


Loved it.


Fits great but material's  a bit too thin


Nice simple dress a little long but but long than too short it can always be cut which I did


love the dress


This dress is a perfect fit! I am 5 feet 5inches 145 pounds, and I bought a size


Beautiful but Difficult dress.


Material thin


This dress is beautiful and just what I was looking for!!! The fit is just right although a little longer on me since I'm only 5 feet. I love it ğŸ˜˜ğŸ˜˜


The material was terrible and the color was darker than the picture. Don't trust for this dress to look like the picture!
