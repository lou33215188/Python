Fit perfectly. Love this dress!


Love! Super cute with my petticoat. You won't regret it!


I was super excited when I ordered this product because I am very into the 50s. When I got it in the mail, I was very disappointed in this product. The material feels rough and the zipper snags every time I try to zip it. The skirt falls flat too and has no curving to it like the picture. I am an XL so that is what I ordered; barely fits and feels weird to sit in.


I'm a large so I ordered it large but it fits me like a small. I cannot wear it at all. I do like it. I just can't wear it..


I had to return it.


It fit everywhere except for my shoulders.


I could have worn it, but if I was worried of ripping it if I had to move too quick.


Love it.


Very cute, just a little long than expected but can just wear higher heels.


I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.

Beautiful dress. Cheap stitching. The zipper always snags at the seam in the back.


Bow is a nice touch. Pretty fabric.


Reviewing for AMZ.


Got this for my wife, she loves it. The material is high quality and thick. It's not stretchy.
