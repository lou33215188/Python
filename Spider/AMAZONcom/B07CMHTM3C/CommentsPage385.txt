Adorable dress but had to send back because it was too big.


Not what I expected


The dress had a hole in the back. I was very disappointed with the brand Anni CoCo. Will not be shopping from this brand again.


Great fit!


Love this dress!!!!


Too big


Delivered with huge ink or dye stain on the front. Tried to launder it myself, but the stain won't come out. Too late to exchange for another one. Stuck with a damaged product, I think. :(


Dress is pretty, a little snug.  I am just extremely upset that when I opened it the dress has stains on it.  Needless to say I am returning it and don't think I want another one!  It is quite disgusting!


Unwearable. I'm 5'1 and it came up to my shins!!


This dress is NOT made to wear as homecoming dress or any other event of the sort. I'm returning it ASAP!!!!
