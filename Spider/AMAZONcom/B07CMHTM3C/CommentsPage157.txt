it fit perfect


My daughter loves this dress, very figure flattering. She wants one in every color.


My 13 yr old daughter loves this dress! It reaches her mid calf and comes in at the waist.


The dreee fits fine, but its too short.


It's cute it fits right, how ever it is NOT WHITE it is off white!


When ordering this dress, get a size small than what u are. Not returning it but definitely going to get it altered to fit the shape of my body.


Weird, everyone stated to order up because the sizes ran small, but the size actually ran big.  Love the style though.


Beautiful dress and it came in time for Thanksgiving. My only issue is the bust doesn't account for women who have larger than a B cup so I had to sew the buttons together so I wouldn't give a show away.


I absolutely love it!! I've been looking for vintage dresses such as this one now I have a reason to wear it cause it came in on time for the holidays!ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


Cute but definitely go a size up
