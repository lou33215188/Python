Fits right


Perfect fit and amazing look


Love this dress. Fits nice.


I love it! The fabric is thick and the length is long.


I like it but if you are "busty" or anywhere above a C cup, you may want to go up one size to avoid smashing your girls into a uni-boob. If you open it up a few buttons it's better but it will show a good amount of cleavage if you're wearing a push up bra with it.  Other than that, it's a cute dress, sturdy material, well stitched. I'll enjoy wearing it mid-Summer as it's not too heay.
