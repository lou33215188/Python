Very nice dress, I would have given 5 stars if it would have had pockets. Wore it with a tulle under skirt, which made it look better. Received a lot of complaints the first day.


Beautiful dress but the X strap in the back did not sit down well adjustable straps would have been helpful


The instructions says to order 2 sizes bigger, well when I got it, it fit 2 sizes too big!


Fits great.  I am 5'6" 185 and got an xl.  Length is perfect.  Material feels more like nylon than cotton.  Great dress for a wedding or shower!


Fit very nice. Exactly what I expected the dress would be like. Very happy with the dress and delivery.


The material feel of this dress is excellent, fit is small


Its very pretty, nice flowy material . I'm 120lbs and 5'8". The dress is decently long , it stopped at my ankles. I really do like it. I'll post pictures by tomorrow probably.


Great color but shorter then I expected.  I am 5'7 so if I leaned over I shall feel a breeze for sure ! Lol By the tutu slip  ( i have black)and it's awesome. Quality of fabric is what is to be expected for price.


The dress was perfect. I purchased it for a Sock Hop dance, as well as to mirror Lucy, from I Love Lucy look, and it was a 100% PERFECT! Love Love Love


Quality item, and at great price.came quick and easy
