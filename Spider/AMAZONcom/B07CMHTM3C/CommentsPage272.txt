Really cute dress, but was too big. The back drooped down and you could see my bra. I ordered a large based on the size chart, but should have gotten a medium.


beautiful but definitely runs big. I would have gotten a size smaller. Not as dressy as I assumed but I still wore it to a wedding (as a guest) and it worked out


very nice dress but somewhat long.


Fits well, a little give around the chest, which is nice. I received it quickly.


very cute dress but it seemed to run large.


size Large fit me perfect as I am a size 12./40D


The dress was of surprisingly good quality given other reviews.  I did not find the fabric to be thin at all.  Beautiful dress!


I love this dress.  I got so many compliments and I love the cute heart buttons.


Dress was very pretty and fit well everywhere but the bust. I needed 4-6 inches more in the bust. Would be great for any one C cup and smaller


It fits perfectly everywhere but in the chest.  A little tight but manageable.
