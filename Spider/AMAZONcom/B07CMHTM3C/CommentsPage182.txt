Cute, but fits tighter than I expected


nice dress


The wife loves it!  Fits perfectly and looks great.  Seems to be good quality.


This is a nice, well made dress. The fabric is light and it fits well.


Fits perfectly (I'm 5'4" and 180 pounds). The halter top can be a little hard to tie / the knot can weigh down on your neck a bit, and it is a little bit longer than what I would usually wear, but overall a very cute dress!


Fits exactly as expected.


Love the material. Well made.


Will be buying more .

My gf loved the dress , used for a 50's themed party . She's 6' and I believe she got the large. Fit very well .
