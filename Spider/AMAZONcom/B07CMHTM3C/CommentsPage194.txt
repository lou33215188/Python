My daughter couldn't be happier, she loves this dress. This dress is exactly what she wanted; the size, length and color is perfect.


It was too.short.  But, it is a nice dress.


Nice fabric; great price.  Heart buttons not silly; I would have had to switch them for round (somber scene in school play), but not necessary.


LOVE IT. FEELS GREAT ON, VERY FLEXIBLE FABRIC.


I wear a size 10 and I thought a large most definitely would fit. This dress was like 2 sizes smaller. I have to give it away. So the true size of this dress was not what I expected.


Cute dress, fits as expected


I bought for my 50s housewife costume.  It was perfect.  Very comfortable because the material is stretchy.  Even though it was for a costume, it is a dress I can wear again.


Great dress.  I got the grey medium and it fit my 5'3" 145 lbs frame perfectly.  The material is stretchy and easy to iron.


Fit great in the torso area but much shorter than pictured!!


When it first arrived it seemed ok. But I didn't have an occasion to wear. When I finally wore it to an event a month later I realized that even though when I put it on it was ok once you started moving it was too large/bulky and not fitting well


Sadly too late to return...
