Cute dress! I'm a size M but the L was just right.


I Swing Dance professionally, and I thought this dress would be perfect for such occasions. It moves surprisingly well and fits just fine. However, I got the small and it was a bit large at the waist. The fabric won't tear easily and works great! Great for dancing, parties, and etc.!


Good quality, good fit.


I recommed getting a slip with tulle to wear underneath. Very cute! Needs ironing and will probably need a lint roller. Zipper sticks a little, but I'm happy with it overall for the $20 I paid. Arrived in about a week or so, even with the holiday!!


honestly i beg you to love yourself and never buy this for yourself or anyone it's the ugliest thing i've ever seen HAHAHHA oh my god it looks nothing like the picture and it's terrible


So cute! The belt is a little thinner than it appears in the photo, but the material is high quality. The dress is very well made.


Had to hem a few inches off as it is quite long on a shorter body, but the dress is beautiful.


Love love love this dress. It fits beautifully, great length... awesome price. Can't go wrong.


great summer dress. great price.


The dress is beautiful. The down fall is that its too tight and shows everything. Pantie line bra lines everything. I wear a size 3pants small in shirts 36B and it was way to tight. And there was only one size so I took my chance on it


Beautiful dress.  Slightly small fit, but I am able to wear it.
