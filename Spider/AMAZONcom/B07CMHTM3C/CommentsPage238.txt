I loved this dress. I went with the white for a Halloween costume idea I had. It was fantastic. I'm always between a 16-18 US. The XX-Large was perfect. Attaching costume pic. I scared the crap out of folks with this. Creepy and awesome. The fit was flattering. Definitely going to grab another for something other than Halloween.


It looks really pretty from the pictures on here. I shouldve ordered a size smaller because it was pretty big and made me look pregnant.


This was so much better than even expected! Fit perfectly and my daughter's 13th birthday was extra special because of it!


Loved the dress and so did everyone else.  The fit was perfect.  I ordered a medium and I am 5'2 -120 lbs.  bra 34-B.  I love the dress so much, I have ordered two more.  Great price and good quality, much better than expected.


This is a very well made dress with high quality materials. It's very sexy but in a romantic simple sort of way. I feel like I am 20 years younger but with sophisticated maturity.  I urge all to give Anni Coco a chance to make you feel beautiful!


Wow! Fits perfectly, looks beautiful, and appears to be well made. The fit is so flattering, and I feel gorgeous in it. I will definitely be buying more dresses from Anni Coco. Well worth the money!


This dress is perfect! It washed well, minimal wrinkling. Light and airy for the hot Vegas summer! I am in love!!!!


Love, love, love this dress.


Love! True to size. The first time I wore it I got so many compliments.


Great dress. I loved the color, better than online. Runs short, get a bigger size or a good girdle.
