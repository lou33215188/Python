I normally wear an 8-10 Medium,  ordered the large, I'm gkad I did. Still a shade small, but not bad. Very cute dress.


Very Very cute.  I am going on a cruise with my adult children and want my girls to get this in different colors to wear on the cruise, with me.


This dress is so lovable! The style of my Polka Dot Dress is real, just as advertised!!
