I really wish it fit better....the back was too puckered and had to send it back.  Will try a smaller size so the top is more snug.  The look is super rad!!


Very lovely dress, I get a lot of compliments. Maybe a tad bigger than I was expecting, but still fits nicely.


It fits decent.I didn't like the thick straps once you tie the sundress thats all you see is the bow and ribbon. My daughter and I made an adjuztment and now its fine


Love this dress but the sizing is off so I had to return the first one.


Zipper was hard to zip up but the fit was great.


Fits beautifully and is very nice quality. Would definitely order this style again. :)


Buy your size or size down cause its a little loose, but this is a phenomenal dress!


Very cute dress, well-made, nice fabric. fast shipping. Thanks!


Love, love, love this dress. Looks fabulous on and very comfortable. Great price.


Very good quality and nice fabric.  Fits as expected.
