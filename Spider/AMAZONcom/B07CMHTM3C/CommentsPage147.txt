This dress is CUTE! I am 200lbs 5'9" broad shoulders 38D and got a Large. It hangs about two inches below my knees and fits very comfortably around the waist. Fits my boobs great to, not to much cleavage and nothing hangs out.


I received this dress and it fit well. Make sure you check the sizing chart because I did measure a size larger than average. I wore this, with a red petticoat, to a wedding at an old mansion and it was a huge hit! I will likely buy another dress from them in the future.


This dress runs extremely small.  Even the extra large fits like a small. Had to return it.


It is a cute dress but the chest is a bit tight.  The buttons are functional (they may gap) but there is a side zipper so if you want to sew the front it wont be a problem.


It was very nice and was the fabric is wanted it was flattering but not for my body type i had to return it. But if your slim and tall this is perfect for u


The dress is fine except the size runs big. I ordered this with two day shipping because I needed it for an event it arrived late and I had to purchase a different dress.


A bit tight in the breast area but that's expected if you have a larger top half.


I didn't love it or hate it. It is cute tho, but simple.


Arrived damaged missing buttons. would have loved to keep it as I liked the fit. Sad to have to return it.


Ok
