I love this dress.  I needed to purchase another to see if the size fit better.  the ONLY reason I returned one was due to the other size did fit me better.  I am wearing this dress to our Chamber Gala Masquarade ball and I am sure I will be getting many compliments on it.  It is well made and BEAUTIFUL.


Beautiful dress at an incredible price. Ran a little long. I shortened it at the seam hidden under the beaded hem. Very easy to shorten. Love this dress. 10 stars.


Beautiful glam dress!


Dress is beautiful. Elegant, as pictured. Sadly, not true to sizing listed.


I am completely in love with this dress! It's elegant, comfortable and hides the tummy pouch.


This dress is stunning!  I ordered it in the champagne to be my wedding dress and was a bit anxious about whether or not it would match the description and would be suitable. I needn’t have worried.  It was just as beautiful as the picture and fit to perfection right out of the packaging. Now I can’t wait to wear it on my wedding day!!!


I liked the dress, however it didn’t have that look I was looking for.


Absolutely LOVE it! Was nervous about the fit but it fits great. It has some stretch which I’m so thankful for since I have curves. Definitely recommend this dress!! Bought a size 6/8, I’m 5’5 and 145-150 lbs.


This dress was perfect for the event I attended! Very flattering as well!


It's too small for me and I have to return it - but it's a beautiful dress.  Barely covered my butt and I kind of looked like a sparkly sausage.  I think it would be safe to order a size up and it would be outstanding.
