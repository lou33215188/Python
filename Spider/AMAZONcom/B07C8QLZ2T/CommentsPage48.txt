Beautiful dress! I'm 5'9 and around 160 lbs, the dress fit me perfect long wise. I first ordered the 10/12 size but it fit me a little loose, so I ordered the next size down and it fit  perfect ,so I would recommend to get a size down than your true size since it runs a little big plus it's stretchy.Great value for a low price.


great price, great fit arrived on time.....


I wore this to NYC to a Broadway play. It was absolutely beautiful. HIGHLY recommended.


This dress was gorgeous and fit great!


Beautiful! Used these for my gatsby wedding and they were perfect. A little long but all my girls were short anyway. A little heel goes along way. Ordered 2 sizes up on all the girls and every ones fit perfect.


Love it!!!! I ordered a 18/20 because my breast are huge and it fits perfectly. Everybody loved the dress. I wore it to an adult prom


Ran a bit too large so I sent it back.


This dress is simply gorgeous.  I love the way it fits and the colors blend together just right.


Am keeping it, regardless if I wear it to my party tomorrow! It's super comfy and really fun. I'm 5'5", 160lbs, and the size 10/12 fit perfectly.


Nice item, just didnâ€™t look good on me.
