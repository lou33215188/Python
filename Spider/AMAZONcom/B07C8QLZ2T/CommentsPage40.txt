This dress fit my daughter perfectly. It was made very well and very classy.


This dress fit like a glove.  I was the most beautiful women at the 1920's theme pasty.  I will definetly order from them again.


Cute, long 20's style dress.  Very flashy looking, and fun for a 20's inspired evening.  Stretchy and forgiving, hides the curves you DON'T want to show.


dress is absolutely beautiful and my daughter wore it to prom. she got so many compliments and I would definitely buy it again to wear ever to a dinner party.


My husband has a party every April for his work and I had heard that Amazon offered beautiful dresses at a convenient price. Happy that I decided to go with this dress for the event. Affordable, flattering and flowy!


This dress had an amazing fit and look. worth every dime that i spent on it. I received so many compliments. I am 5'2" 147lbs and the Medium fit good with plenty of comfort. The dress would have been too long for flats but fits perfect in length with heels.


This dress is so elegant and beautiful. The fix was perfect. No one at The Great Gatsby party I attended had it on as everyone went with the flapper dress. I was do glad I made this choice.


Beautiful dress! Bought this for my daughter but wasn't flattering for her shape. Highly recommend the dress for someone else


I ordered this dress for a Mardi Gras ball and was a little nervous about ordering one online. I read other reviews to see how other people’s fit them so I ordered a 10-12. I’m about 5’4 and weigh about 145 and it fits great it’s just a little long but I put heals on with it. The material is not too tight and stretches some.


Didn’t like the way it fit with the sheer bottom above my bottom.  :)
