I loved this dress. I received many compliments on it. Pretty true to size.


Loved it. Received lots of compliments. It fit a little big, but it was a great buy.


Absolutely stunning....my only complaint is that it took so long to get here.  Make sure you order in plenty of time to receive!


Just got this Gown 5 minutes ago....LOVE IT.....have a 1920's party to attend,looked at some


similar ones for hundreds of dollars...49.99...PERFECT for me! Thank you Amazon!


I really like it but it's bigger than I thought. Should be there x small size


looks good


I received some many complements. And it was so comfortable.


Dress is very comfortable and gorgeous for the price! Only down fall is a cheap zipper, but it did the job for my sisters prom ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜�


LOVE the dress fits perfect except the length lucky I know someone who can hem it up a little you should ask for the person height other than that I absolutely love it


Beautiful, but tight
