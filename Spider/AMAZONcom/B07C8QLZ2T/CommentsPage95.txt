Very nice dress! Good guality. It fits like it schould.


Just was cheaply made not worth $50. Looked nothing like the picture.


I thought it was a very pretty dress and fit true to size for an hour glass, size 14 body type.  I didn't like that the lining did not go all the way down to length of dress.  Made it look cheap because you could see legs thru it.


This dress is absolutely gorgeous.


Extremely happy with this purchase! The quality is great for the price and the fit is perfect. Seriously recommend this dress if you want a fancy look at an affordable price.


Fit perfect!  Gorgeous on and very figure flattering!!


Absolutely beautiful! I bought this dress for a NYE 1920's Bash, I received so many compliments that I lost count.


The dress fits nice. It's just not long enough. I expected it to be on the floor but instead it sits on top on my shoes. :, (


perfect dress length and fit..I am 5'11"


Truly a beautiful gown. I'm amazed at how light it is with All that sequence on the gown. Great value for the price. Well made too.
