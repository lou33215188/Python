This dress was stunning on my wife.  The compliments were constant all evening, as well as on her Facebook page.  I highly recommend this dress.


Cheapest mesh material I would give it a negative zero


I love this dress and it fits perfect. I did have to order a second time. I read the reviews and they said they had to order smaller size. But I ended up sending the first one back and got a second one. I am very pleased it fits great. I recommend it to everyone.


Love it!


This dress is absolutely gorgeous!  I purchased it in burgundy & it is beautiful!  The bead work is exquisite! I ordered a size 10 & it fit perfectly. Very happy with my purchase!
