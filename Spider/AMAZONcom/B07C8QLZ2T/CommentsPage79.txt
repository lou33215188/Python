The dress is very flattering!  I wore it to a black tie event for the Bar Assiciation and it looked great!!


Picture is really elegant but fabric and dress itself not so much. I guess I should have paid more attention to the description of sequins which are there. Itâ€™s not as fancy as picture just okay.


I wore this to a black tie event and got so many compliments for it!


I bought this after a last minute invite to a themed party. It came promptly and just as beautiful as the pictures. Size chart was dead on and the dress was a steal at about  $50. With all the beading and sequins it could have easily gone for twice that.


Love the dress


Beautiful dress I should have bought a size smaller but that could be fixed. If you're short you may need to adjust the length. Will buy it again maybe the blue. Oh yeah it's not heavy.


Pretty, but not  as long as I had hoped for a 5'10" height. Could have used, but found a longer dress that fit a little better.


It is a beautiful dress but did not look like the picture advertised,  also the sequined part is not attached to the skirt part and the inner lining is too short


Luv, had to reorder a larger size but luv it


Love this dress! I can't wait to wear it at my daughters wedding. The fit is nice.
