Loved it! Ordered it on a Wednesday, received it on Friday.....wore it Saturday. Beautiful!!!! Received many compliments cause I was looking goodğŸ¤—


I just received this dress, it's absolutely beautiful well detailed and true to fit.  It's a must have for any ball, pageant, wedding, etc.and specially at that price..I love it


great for the price!


Dress arrived covered in hair - I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s animal or human.  It was balled up in a bag and unzipped. I am thoroughly disgusted.


I love the dress but unfortunately it didnâ€™t fit itâ€™s to wide and lose : I wanted to wear it February 7, 2018 for our annual associate party , but couldnâ€™t cause was to big for me.. I will be returning it soon...
