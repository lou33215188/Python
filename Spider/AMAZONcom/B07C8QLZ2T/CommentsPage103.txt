Great dress!  Very forgiving material.  Beautiful sequins and I get so many compliments on it.  I'm 5'3" and wore flats,  so I did have to get it hemmed.  A few stray threads, but I just cut them off.


My wife ordered this dress for a themed event we are attending.  She loved it - it fit well and was fantastic quality for the price!  I've found that online items like this often disappoint - but not this one.  Highly recommend it.


Purchased for a Great Gatsby gala. It was perfect.  It was a bit long as in 5'3; however,  with some heals it was prefect.
