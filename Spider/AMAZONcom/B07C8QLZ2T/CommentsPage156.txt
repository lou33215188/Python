Beautiful dress. Looks just as described in advertisement. My daughter is 5'7" Slender build frame 112lbs 21yr old. Great length for a heel and is lightweight. A little loose in the abs but can be taken in easily. Has a lot of give in the material.


The dress was beautiful but it was not true to size. The black lining underneath was not long enough  to cover everything that needed to be covered. Not good for women that have large breast or butt.


Beautiful Gatsby's gown. I purchased a short 1920s themed dress in a large. It was too small so I ordered an extra large. That also was small. I got frustrated and decided to go with a long gown instead. I usually wear a size 8 /10 so I went with my gut and ordered an extra large in this dress. When I received it I was surprised at how large it actually was. Realistically, I could wear a large, but I don't like my clothes to fit tight. So the extra large will work just fine for me. I am 5 foot eight and about a hundred and sixty pounds. Curvy around the hips and thighs. This dress runs long. I will definitely need to wear at least a 2-inch heel. Excellent dress for a terrific price.


This dress is simply stunning! It will need hemmed, but I can do that easily by taking it up underneath the sequinned overskirt. Comfortable, and not scratchy.


Fits well.


Great service, dress is beautiful, and fit exactly as measurements said it would.


gorgeous


I'm 5'9" 136lbs 36" 28" 37" and it fits me perfect. Not skin tight not loose, length with 3" heels the dress grazes the floor, and quality is of beauty review dresses. You will not be disappointed.
