Stitching isn't the greatest but overall it's a pretty dress. It is a little on the small side.


Beautiful dress.  The beadwork is extraordinary.  Very pleased.


The bottom skirt part is VERY see through. Recommend buying a slip to go under the dress.


Beautiful dress.. the fit was perfect. Came exactly when it said it would ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼


Very pretty and expensive looking! Would recommend to anyone. It is long and had to be hemmed but that is expected for a short person like me!


I bought this in the Champagnes color for a bridesmaid dress, it's nice quality, I was nervous about ordering such an important item online, but it ended up working perfectly. Some of the beads fell off, only a few, can't even tell where they came from. Love the flowy bottom. Definitely purchase this dress, don't wait!


I love the dress. It is a slightly loose but that's what I wanted so I am very happy with it. The picture perfectly represents the dress that came in the mail to me. I do have to him it 5 inches because I am quite short (5 1) but other than that I LOVE it


My daughter wore this dress to prom, and she was absolutely beautiful. I couldn't believe I got such a great deal on this dress.


I normally wear a 12, and according to the size chart, would have ordered the 10/12. However I was able to try this on in a 10/12 before ordering. I ended up purchasing the 6/8 and it fit perfectly. The length is good on me (I'm 5'5") so it won't need any alterations. I agree with other reviewers on the length of the beaded, lined area vs. the sheer part. It hits just below my butt, and it does feel wicked short. Overall, happy with this purchase. Can't wait to wear this.


I really Love this dress! I was so disappointed when it came and it was too short. I am about 5'9" and 160 lbs. It fit through the bodice great, but was just an inch too short in the length. As it is, i have a hard time finding dresses that fit me properly, so i was almost expecting it to be too short.
