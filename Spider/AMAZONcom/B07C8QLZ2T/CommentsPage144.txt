Love the dress and quality but it fit a little big


Too short and cheap looking


It fit perfect love it.


Just a tiny too big but other then that it's beautiful


Loved it. Just wasn't aware that the bottom is completely see through.


Very fast delivery, a little bit bigger than I anticipated.


This dress is stretchy, sexy and comfortable. I'm 5'1" and I ordered an 2/4. It puddled the ground just like the photo. I danced the night away at a wedding at a jazz club. I'm 48 and I haven't felt this sexy and beautiful in a long time. You need to buy this dress!


Love it


Good quality, looks nice and fits perfect. I love it!


Beautiful dress gits like a glove true to size
