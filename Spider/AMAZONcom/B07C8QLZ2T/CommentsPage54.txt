This is a beautiful gown! It is heavy and very well made. Unfortunately, It was too small for me but that was my fault. I gave it to my mother and she looked beautiful in it!


Beautiful and elegant! The dress had enough stretch and I was very comfortable in it.


Dress fit perfect, i ordered based on my bust size. It was comfortable. I got so so so many compliments on it. I absolutely loved this dress and i felt so pretty!


I ordered this dres 2 sizes larger than my actual size and it fits perfectly.


The quality of the dress is great.  However it was slightly too large so I'm returning it and ordering a size smaller.  I normally wear a size 10, so I ordered the medium.  I will be ordering the small this time.


I love the fit and the overall quality of the dress but I added extra material due to the bottom half was to sheer for me.


Perfection in every sense of the word. Im 5 foot 1 inch tall and 200 pounds and it fit exactly right.


I liked it but something about it fitted a little strange.  I ended up wearing another dress but I will probably keep this since it was so reasonable...definitely not good for a hot day...


Beautiful quality and fit. Only got 4 stars because of length. I was excited because reviews noted how long it was...well tall girls find something else. I’m 5’11 and this hit above my ankles (not even close to the floor). Will be returning. If you’re 5’9 and below, it will be long enough for you.


Fits perfect to size. A straight line on top. Bottom is a sealed gem so as not to unravel.
