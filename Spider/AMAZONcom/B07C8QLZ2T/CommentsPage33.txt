It is a pretty dress but just not my style.  I love the colors and it is quality.  I think it would look good if I were taller.


What is pretty and fits dress for me. It better than imagined. Also the dress has good quality with good fabric. Love it!


The dress fit perfectly. I loved it until I arrived at the venue and I noticed the beading and sequins were falling off. A few hours later I noticed a decent sized hole where the top part ends. No one else could see it but Iâ€™m pretty disappointed it barely lated one evening.


This dress was PERFECT! Even though the actual dress don't look exactly like the pic, I STILL LOVED IT!I was a little nervous about the size. I am a 40DDD! Plenty at the top, and nothing at the bottom ğŸ˜•. I ordered a XL. The material is a good quality and is a little stretchy.  I could have got away with a LğŸ¤”. I wanted to be safe than sorry. I received plenty of compliments that night. I'm glad I looked on Amazon!


This is a beautiful dress and looks very expensive!  I can't believe the price.  I ordered the navy blue and it is both elegant and sexy.  It is very comfortable as fits perfectly.  I highly recommend this dress.


It was an awesome purchase! Purchased for a gatsby party and had it brought in so it would fit a little better, I'm normally a size two so this was a little baggy pre alteration. Got lots of compliments ! Seriously looks like it could be worth 300 dollars and it's only 40 bucks! Such a great deal for this. You won't regret this buy!


This is an amazing dress. My daughter wore it to a vintage themed wedding. It was perfect!


I have been in love with this dress for several months.  I bought it for a party that I had this past Saturday.  It was gorgeous when it arrived.  Unfortunately, it was also tighter than expected. I returned it for a refund and wore a different dress.


I absolutely LOVED this dress! I had a black tie wedding to attend and ordered this dress in an xs and small just to be safe. The small fit ok but I wanted it slightly more form fitting without being too tight. The xs was perfect so Iâ€™m returning the small. I normally wear a size 6 in jeans.


I got so many compliments. I canâ€™t wait to wear it again.


This dress is gorgeous.  Looks so much more expensive.  The fabric is very rich looking.  I purchased this for an elaborate party and I feel soooooo elegant in it.  I am definitely thrilled with this purchase.
