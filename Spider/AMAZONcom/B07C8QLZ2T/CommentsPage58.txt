It looks amazing!!! the quality is much better than I expected. However, as it was a little too big for me, I had to return it. Runs slightly larger than usual.


I really liked this dress, but, could not use it.  I am 5'9 and the dress is just too short for me.  It also appeared a little boxy instead of the curviness that I was hoping for.


Great quality, lots of stretch


This is a very pretty dress! Well worth the money paid! Fits nicely. The material has a bit of stretch to it which is nice. Would have given it 5 stars except there were a few beads loose.  Still an excellent buy and I would purchase it again.


Ordered one size up but was still a bit tight, I wore it to a gatsby party and everyone complimented me on it and were surprised that I got it from what I now lovingly refer to as Amazon Couture.


Nice


I am 5'6" and way too long I sent it back. GOrgeous dress though!


the dress was really pretty, and based on the reviews i got a 10/12 and it fit perfectly. i normally wear a larger size so the dress is stretchy. the only problem was the dress was too long for me. I did have someone hem it.


Beautiful dress - fast shipping - fit perfect


Simply stunning gown.  Fits beautifully and all the sequins are well attached.  Just PERFECT!
