Wife looks stunning in this dress. Was way better expedience than expected from shopping online and not being able to try it on first. Description was accurate which made ordering easy


I like the the fit and it's not a heavy dress,the only thing is the lining is very short and the bottom of the dress is  see through but it's not too bad.


Gorgeous Dress! Not for my body type after all, but beautiful for someone else.  Looked great on my daughter.


This dress is gorgeous. However it runs large. I have been a 12- large forever and I would have needed a medium. It is a beautiful dress great quality for the price.


Absolutely beautiful gown! So excited to be wearing this to my daughters wedding. It's a perfect fit too!


Very pretty, nice  material kind of thin but I love it money well spent !! I order a size small and it fixes perfectly. And I am 136


The dress is very pretty but thin at the bottom even with the lining.


Dress fits perfectly!! :)


Very nice dress! My MIL really liked it


Beautiful dress, well made, but returning it because it wasn't flattering to my figure. I looked like a sequined sausage! LOL
