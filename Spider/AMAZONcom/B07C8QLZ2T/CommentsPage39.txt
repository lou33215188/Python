I like the dress, but after 2 tryons, there is a rip in the side and the sequence fell off.  Please advise whether I should return or should I expect that of the replacement dress.


Thank you,

Lovely dress quality fabric & workmanship.


An amazing value never believe such a reasonable price.


Beautiful dress.  Good fit, nice long skirt for a tall girl like me.  Having trouble with the zipper, hope I can get it to work on the special night I'm wearing it this weekend.  Keeps getting stuck!  Aaargh!


Very pretty. Size is on point. Purchased for a 1920 theme party, but could be worn again for a different function.


Wore this to a family wedding. I got so many compliments!!! Everyone loved it and it was comfortable


Very pretty dress very well-made for this price, but for me it runs a little large. I am a small person and I usually wear zero or two. This dress was too large for me. I wish they could offer it in extra small


Looks beautiful and fits perfectly! Cant wait to wear it for our cruise!


I love this dress, especially for the price! Although, I am disappointed the black & nude doesn't come in 2-4 size as the medium is roomy and not as flattering as I hoped it would be.


This dress is beautiful and fits well. It was a bit short, I am 5'10 but it did not take away from the beauty and well-fit feel of the dress. It deserves all 5 star. I felt beautiful at the event I attended and the many compliments I received sealed my belief. You will not regret this purchase.


I love this dress!!!! I’ll be wearing it for my daughter’s wedding in the fall. The fit is perfect and it’s so comfortable. I saw some reviews that said the skirt is see through, but mine isn’t. It’s very lightweight material but not see-through at all. I can’t believe the quality for the price - just get it and try it! Excited to wear this beautiful gown at my daughter’s special day!
