The dress was preety but i couldnt fit it


This dress was more then I expected. It was beautiful and the size was great.


The dress is awesome.


I received compliments all night! It fit great, accentuated the positives and hid the negatives.


Love this to 1920 style dress I felt like a queen!


Very good quality, great fit and long enough for 5'8" gal. I love the dress. A very good find for the price.


Got so many compliments! Wore it to a Mystery Theater Dinner. The theme was roaring 20s. It fit beautifully and it's great quality. I may wear it to the Marine Corps Ball in the fall!


Did not fit.  The dress is beautiful but you must be taller then 5'4" and have no stomach.  Need to send it back.


Beautiful
