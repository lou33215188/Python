It looks cheap, I bought it wear for photoshoot and edded up not wearing as first picture i took turned out to be bad. Quality of the dress is cheap.


I bought this for a New Years Eve party, and it was a total hit!!  It is advertised as a "Gatsby" dress, but i wore it in 2017, and no one seemed to think I was wearing a costume or something out of time.  It is beautiful, and I got compliment after compliment!  It is very well made and held up beautifully to a long night of sitting, standing, posing and dancing.  The shoulders and the bottom of the dress are sheer which make the dress sexy without showing anything important.  I am 5' 4" and 150 lbs. and  I ordered a 10/12 medium.  I wore 5 inch heels, and therefore did not have to have it hemmed, but it would've been an easy job if I'd have had to. LOVE THIS DRESS!!!


Bought it for a ball. loved it and the style. only down side it was a bit snug but not to much! the arm were tighter than anything. which made it a tad uncomfortable.


Love the dress.  I ordered a 20/22 and it fit like a size 16/18. I can never wear a size 22 but I chose a larger size just in case it ran small. I wore it anyway because I didnâ€™t have a choice. Felt self-conscious because it was too snug. Overall nice quality but they need to review the sizing.


This is a beautiful dress. Better than I expected for the price.


Beautiful dress and excellent price. I received compliments all night long!!


would like to return


Beautiful dress, received a ton of comments about it. Fits a little snug for ladies with large chest areas. I went up a size and was much more comfortable.


Got this dress for my daughters Prom and it was great


This is a great dress, makes my shape look fab.
