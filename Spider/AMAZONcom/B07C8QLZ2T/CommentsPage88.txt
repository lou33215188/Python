THIS DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL!!!


LOVE IT!!!


The dress was absolutely beautiful, the fit was great. I was not able to wear it because the zipper wouldn't go past about 4 inches from the top. Other than the zipper great dress


Dress is pretty. Fit was loose in certain areas where it should be tight...


I figured it would run a bit small.... im a solid 14 16. Reluctantly i went up a size to 18 20 which i am not big but just so i could have it altered. But it fit like a 14 16 so no need to alter..


I LOVE this dress...I am 5â€™8 & 140 lbs. I purchased a size medium. It arrived in 2 days & It fits perfect:) Does not need to be hemmed:) Great travel dress for my event:)


Love love love it


Poorly made. Skirt was sheer. The sweetheart neckline came almost up to my neck. Very disappointed.


Fun


Nice dress but the under skirt seemed some what short especially when sitting down! Returned it as it seemed a little too dressy for my occasion!
