My cousin had a very formal wedding in Chicago and I wanted to look stunning but I also didn't want to pay a lot. This dress is beautiful. For such an elaborate looking dress (and that really is beading and sequins) it fits very easily, I didn't feel as though it was too heavy and it is very forgiving to problem areas. My only complaint it that the sequins cut up my arms a bit but my skin is also very sensitive. It's a great dress. I was very happy with it.


Great dress. Not cheaply made, fabric is thicker than i expected. It was great for a Great Gatsby Party I went to this weekend.


Beautiful dress! I am a solid size 10 and ordered the 10/12. It has a bit of stretch and I wonder if I could have gone a size down. But it's nice that it's not super tight and the length is just right on my 5'6 frame with 2-3 inch heels and I wonder if the mesh part may have started too high up on the smaller size. Cannot wait to wear this dress.


Soooo Beautiful.. this dress is perfect for holiday parties but I got the wrong size so pardon my pictures because I look silly in it!


The bead work is breathtaking and it hugs your body beautifully.. I ended up with an extra small vs a small so it cuts me off mid cestğŸ¤¦ğŸ�»â€�â™€ï¸�


This is a beautiful dress for the price you pay.  The sequins shimmered when you move.  The gown flows in pure elegance. There is a zipper in the back.  Thesweetheart neckline  The bodice was a bit short in the rear making me feel uncomfortable and it was tight around the thighs when you sit.  I purchased the size according to the chart and it did run a bit small.  Otherwise it's a beautiful dress for any event.  Gatsby, Wedding, Gala, etc....


I ordered this in navy in size XS (2-4) and it fit very well.  I'm 5'4" and weigh 112 lbs and was wearing very high heels.  I also ordered 2 other dresses that were 4 and 5 times more expensive, but this one looked the best.  It's construction seems less sturdy than the other dresses, but I don't plan on wearing this every day. For the price, this is a great dress!


Very beautiful and elegant dress. I bought this for a 1920's bridal shower for the bride she is very happy with it. It looks absolutely stunning on her and fits perfect! I would say it's true to size and has a little stretch to it. Very happy with this purchase.


The dress is absolutely gorgeous and definitely worth the price.  The bead-work is incredible!  The sheer starts at the hip, but has an under-dress that falls mid-thigh on a 5'10" lady.  This dress was bought for my sister, she wears the 20/22 size, but it was definitely a bit snug.  The length was good even in bare feet. She liked the dress a lot and was able to move and dance with confidence.


I purchased this dress to wear to a 1920s-themed Barrister's Ball. The good thing is that when it arrived, it fit me perfectly, and the dress was well made. The bad, however, is that I felt the dress to be a little more like a costume and not a gala dress. I give this 4 stars because the material seemed durable and the sequins were sowed on well, yet I definitely could not wear it for the event I wanted.


I had three days to find a dress so wear to a wedding but I didnâ€™t have any time to go to the store, I took a chance and ordered this! I was so happy with the quality and designâ€™ ! The quality of this dress is amazing, in a dress shop you could easily pay 4x this price.!
