I loved this dress.  The dress came as pictured. It fit really well.  The beading was beautiful.


This Dress was perfect for the occasion and beyond my expectations, I received so many compliments I really loved it.


The dress is gorgeous and fit like a glove. Bought it for a friend to wear for her Surprise 40th Great Gatsby party and she LOVED the dress! She did not want to take it off or the night to end!!


Perfect fit.  Ordered small.  Weigh 134 and am 5ft 2 inches.  Just needs hemming.  Sheer but not to sheer below bodice.  Beautiful gown for the price.  Looks a lot more expensive than it really is.  Would highly recommend.


Love it.


Baby shower dress. Many compliments!!


The dark green & black is elegant & slimming. I'm 5'7" & the sequined upper design comes down far enough for coverage & the sheer bottom is not a problem. Exceptional dress at a bargain pice. A flattering fit based on usual size 14.


Wore this to a great Gatsby party and it was stunning.  Very well made for the price.


Love it..its gorgeous.. the couple of cons I have is the under slip should come down a little further. It fits a bit snug. I do love it.. can't wait to wear it


I love this dress, It was beautiful on.
