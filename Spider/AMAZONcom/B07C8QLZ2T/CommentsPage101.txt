The dress is beautiful.  My daughter picked it out to wear to her senior prom. It fits her nicely at 5'8" and 145#.


Stunning


I really liked the dress. The shipping was quick. I have no complaints on the dress.


Everyone loved the dress!!!


Package arrived fast. The dress was right size. Size chart is accurate. Would buy from this company again.


This dress exceeded my expectations.  It is absolutely lovely!!  It is very stretchy so you can get a size smaller


I love the color and style.  The fit is near perfect, however I think there should have been a hem on the bottom.


Sizing chart was a huge help in trying to guess my size. It fit beautifully. I didn't even have to hem it!!!!


Gorgeous well worth the money! Just one size up from normal clothing. Thank you making the dress so affordable!  My daughter is wearing to the prom.  Everyone loves it.  Also delivery was very prompt.


This dress got so many compliments it was unreal! Loved the fit and how it helped to hold me in.


Beautiful!
