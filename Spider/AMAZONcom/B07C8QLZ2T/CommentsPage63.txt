Smaller than I expected and way too short for me. I am 5'10" and it was above my ankles


This dress is perfect. I actually saw this same dress a few days ago in a bridal store for way more. The dress arrived in 3 days. This was an excellent choice.


I couldn't be any more happier with this dress shopping was fast and quality is great I feel like it's very true to size I got a 14/16 and it fit like a glove. I highly recommend it


This dress is beautifully made, lots of compliments. This dress is well worth the buy and then some!!!


Absolutely love, love, LOVE this dress. Great idea for a last minute formal event. Why spend in excess of $300 for a 3 hour, 1 time dress. Love it!!! IT'S MORE THAN A COSTUME!!!


Beautiful dress. The picture doesn't even do it justice


Loved it. The fit is great. Only reason I gave it a 4 is because it's really, really sheer at the bottom. Buy a slip and it will be great.


Very pretty and looks amazing. No complaints at all! The dress fit perfectly.


The dress is beautiful, fits well no issues at all, havent worn it to my event yet but looking forward to it.


I loved every bit of it despite that even after going with the chat the dress was snugging. I got a Large but Iâ€™m returning it for a Medium. I love it.
