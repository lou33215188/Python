Haven't worn this dress yet. Bought it to wear for Mother of the Groom, wedding this August. The under-slip was an odd length for me but I had it shortened and hopefully now it will be fine. The dress is BEAUTIFUL and appears to be well made.


This dress is amazing it fit like a glove!! Only thing is, it was a little too long. I’m 5,6. But amazon is amazing with shipping.


Love this dress I'm between a sizes 12 & 14 so I got a 14/16 just in case and it fits well. A little breathing room not tight at all.


So pretty. Just as beautiful as pictured. This is NOT a costume-it is a very pretty dress. Wish this one fit the young lady going to wear it. Fabulous!


The dress was gorgeous. Lots of glitz and glam. I only sent it back because I didn’t want to outshine the bride. Otherwise the dress was perfect and arrived so quick.


I order this dress in my normal size because reviews said it fit as expected, how ever I had to send it back and her the next size up, still to small, this dress has no give for women who are very blessed up top, otherwise it fits great . I really wish I could have wore this dress because the quality for the price is great, I ended up getting a whole new dress for my event


I am not a person who will buy clothing on line, I must try it on to make sure it fits correctly and looks good. Love this dress!  It took a bit to get here, so plan well in advance when you order.  I ordered a 18/20 Plus size, fits like a dream. I am 5'10", so the length is at my ankles, which I want to show off my heals.... so it will be perfect.  The dress is good quality, the sequin work is amazing for the price of this dress as well.


Beautiful dress but cut smaller than size the indicated.


Tried on the dress, the dress fits perfect, very pretty on and looks beautiful. Excited to wear for my black tie event.


I love the dress it fits so nice on me... it looks so fancy I'm going to wear it to a wedding this weekend
