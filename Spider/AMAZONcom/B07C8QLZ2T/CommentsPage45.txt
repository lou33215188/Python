Absolutely gorgeous! Was sad I had to return it. I'm 5'1" so it was way too long. I'm used to having to have things taken up but the upper sequined part of the dress couldn't be done without being grossly expensive. The upper sheath is ment to hit about mid-thigh; on me it was at the knee! Still, it's a beautiful dress.


It fits beautifully!  HIGH QUALITY for the price!!


Fit to size.....my mom loved the length of the dress adns the sequence


This is a gorgeous dress for the price.  Bought it for fa masquerade ball.  I've only tried it on so far but fit was perfect. I'm 5'7 180 Lbs and the length and size was just right.


I loved this dress. Perfect for our 20’s theme gala! Fits like a glove! True to size. I am 5”2 132 pounds and i ordered a 2/4. It’s was still kinda long with 3 inch heels though.


Absolutely loved the dress, got a tremendous amount of compliments. Excellent quality


Very pretty dress and the fit was perfect.  Unfortunately my wife didn't get to wear it due to cancellation of the venue.


I love the dress!! I had so many compliments! I wore it to a Gala. Ladies you will not be disappointed!!!!
