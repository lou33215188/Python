It's beautiful ğŸ˜� and it fit as it was customized for my figure. I wear a size 16 and the cut flatters and doesn't inflate my figure.


Was not flattering on my body type at all. Beautiful dress though.


Great dress for the price.


Beautiful formal dress for our cruise At a wonderful price!


This dress is stunning! I purchased for a big event and I was complemented so many times. The dress is a little heavy and fit perfectly! I am 5'5". Dress with 3" heels worked well!


Beautiful dress and very comfortable. I wore it to a formal event and was probably the most comfortable person there! Would definitely buy again!


Looks very elegant.


this dress is absolutely GORGEOUS!! iwas so very disappointed that the arms were made so small and i have large arms. This was the only thing I could find wrong with this dress.If in the future you would make the holes for the arms larger, I would not hesitate to purchase this dress again. I really do LOVE this dress, Style and fabric is simply beautiful!


Fits my daughter well.  little snug but pretty true to fit.


Fits like a glove love it. It's perfect!!!
