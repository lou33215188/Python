It's a beautiful dress. The XL was a bit too small on me in the hip/bust area and it was not comfortable. The only negative and why I will not try another size is the underskirt/slip only hits at the knee. It should be the same length as the dress itself. This detracts from the elegance of the dress.


I have ordered two dresses for my bridesmaids and both of the ladies were pleased with the dress! I ordered a 10/12 and an 18/20. The dress is great quality and worth the money!


Beautiful dress! A little smaller than I expected, however it's so pretty!


Great dress for the money! Nice quality. Very flattering. I have an hourglass figure. 5'3" and 175lbs . I ordered medium and it fits perfectly. Although, I will need to wear flats with it, as it just brushes the floor while barefoot.


Great quality for price. I'm 5'7 and ordered a 6/8. It's very stretchy and comfortable. I wish it was a little longer though.


Used this in a play it was great


Beautiful dress with some stretch.


Beautiful


Stretchy and flattering. I'm 5'4" so it was like 2" too long, I literally just cut the bottom hem and did not need to sew it! I wore it to a Gala and the bottom did not frey! This is a great dress!


Beautifully made for any formal occasion.
