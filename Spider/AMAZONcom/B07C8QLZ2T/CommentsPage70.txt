nice dress great price


I love this dress, but I wish it fit! I have no waist whatsoever, so it was too big for me in the torso. Everything else about it was pretty!


I loved this dress, however it fit on the bottom half but not the top. It was well made and no sequins came off. The seller was very accommodating. Will purchase in future for other events.


Gorgeous.. surpasses all expectations


I was too cute that night!!


A beautiful beaded dress.  Super comfortable with hidden stretch and not too tight seamed like some beaded dresses.


Perfect fit! I'm 5'4 and weight 63kg- measures: 94cm chest- 73cm waist- 101cm hips. Got a size 6/8, was a bit hesitant but wow! The dress fits like it was taylored made for me. Really looking fwd to wearing it.


Such a beautiful dress! Fit perfect! I was amazed!
