It is very beautiful. Fits as expected, I needed to hem it. Because I'm 5'1". I ordered a size 14-16. Because I were large pants or size 14.


Too small send it back. Also bottom is shear except for a very short slip


I bought this dress for my niece to wear to a military ball and she really loves it.

The dress is the way it's described and it runs good on the sizing. Great dress for a great price.


This gown is made of cheap material. The bottom is see through. Horrible garments


Gorgeous dress and received many compliments on it. For a medium being a 6-8 I expected it to be a little snug as I just started fitting some size 8s but it was a little loose.
