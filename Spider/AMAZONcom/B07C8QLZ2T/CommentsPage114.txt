Very please with price and quality


Beautiful dress, but fit like a 16, not a 22!


I loved the dress!  Fits perfectly. Everybody at the party also loved my dress.


It also came right on time as promised.


Ordered for a bridesmaid dress. The top of the dress is very pretty the bottom is very thin material.


These are not true to size. I ordered the 20/22 and this is my my normal size and the sequined part won't even go over my hips.


I look like a queen in that dress


Runs really small and the picture wasn't a good representation of the actual dress.


A very beautiful dress. Looks better than in the pictures. A variety of color selection is always great.


Pleasantly surprised at the quality of the dress. Very happy.


I didn't realize the bottom skirt part is see through. And the beading was poping off as soon as I pulled it out of the box.
