I brought the 14/16 and it fit perfect. The only thing I didn't like is the sequin under the arm hurt rubbing against my skin after awhile


Dress was exactly what you get for the money...it was the wrong cut for my body type


Absolutely LOVE!!! Order came quickly and just as expected. The beading does not make the dress heavy at all. It is floor length on me, at 5'5.


I am 5'7" and 215lbs and this dress is so comfortable and it looks great I'm going to par it with a black fur shaw


The Gown is beautiful just as I expected I can't wait to wear it to the masquerade birthday ball that I'm going to April 8th


Dress is perfect and reasonably priced. The dress material is slightly stretchy. Delivery was quick. Yes, I'm a real person from upstate NY. I totally recommend this for the price.


The gold embellishment only goes down to a little under your buttocks and the black bottom is see-through. Definitely wear a slip with this dress!


Was surprised at how beautiful this dress was.


Beautiful. Will only use once.  Wil resale of anyone interested
