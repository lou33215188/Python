Beautiful dress. Daughter loved it.


Ordered early enough just incase I needed alterations. Fit perfect. Lovely and elegant. Beautifully Made. I will order again from this company.


Nicely made, just runs small!


I wore this to the Mardi Gras Ball and got so many compliments on it.  It was lovely and I felt like a princess in it!!


This dress for the price was absolutely fantastic. The workmanship was good. It was delivered in a timely manner I received a lot of compliments on my attire including this dress. Make sure you measure yourself before selecting the sizes shown.


This dress is so pretty! I am wearing it to a company Christmas party. I am returning it and changing sizes. (undergarment issues) The dress is good material, it has some weight to it but it is very flexible. LOVE IT!


It looks great, fits just as expected. The only downside is the same downside to any sequin attire: don't rest your arms at your side as it is slightly uncomfortable after a few hours. The dress is beautiful. Go with a strapless bra.


Beautiful dress! Ordered a size bigger than I normally would just incase...glad I did! Still a little snug but it works!


Runs very small. Bottom is much shearer than appears.


I wore it for a 50th birthday party and got so many compliments. It was comfortable and super gorgeous!
