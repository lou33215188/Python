The first thing I will say is that I've never posted a review on any products so this will be my first. I felt this dress deserved a review because it is unbelievable for the price. It is absolutely beautiful and well made. My biggest concern was the size to order. I'm 5'7"and weigh about 145 lbs. Ordinarily, I would purchase a size 12, but since this dress came in 10-12, I felt it would be too small or too tight. This was not the case. It fit great and stretches which makes it very comfortable. The only adjustment that I will have to make is the length. It's too long for the shoes that I normally would wear. I feel like I hit a home run with this purchase. I highly recommend this dress.


Great Fit! Well Made!


Looks gorgeous on. Very stylish.


Way too short in the back, like lower buns exposed too short.  I was really confused because everything else fit fine.  My best friend tried it on, she's two dress sizes smaller then me, same issue.  If you've got any junk in your trunk, fair warning...


I really do like it look like extrely like the picture
