Although the dress is still very pretty and it fits me really well, it is in no way the dress I thought I was ordering. Itâ€™s not even close to the picture. At first I wasnâ€™t going to return it but I notice that everyone else go the dress that looks like the picture, so why didnâ€™t I?


Very nice piece for purchasing last minute


such a fancy dress and awesome price.  LOVELY


Should have been a little bigger need a 3xx or a 4xx but other then that the dress is  gorgeous


Used this dress for a formal night on a cruise and it was amazing. Fit well. Loved it. Weigh 188 I purchased the 10/12. I'm curvy. 36G bra


Exquisite, Gorgeous and Perfect donâ€™t even begin to state the uniqueness and fitting of this dress.  You will get so many compliments on it and the price is unbelievable!  Size is true to fit.


Absolutely loved the dress! 5' 2" so I knew I was going to have to get it hemmed, but that did not alter the final look of the dress! So many complements though out night! Sparkles did not irritare my skin


Love this dress! I wear a size 12-14 and ordered an XL and it fit a little big but the dress was perfect.

Fantastic!  Beautiful dress for the money.  I ordered a small and it will be perfect.  I will have to shorten it a little but that's okay.
