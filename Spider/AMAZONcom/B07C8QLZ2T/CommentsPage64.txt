Love it


I ordered a size bigger and it is still very tight.


The gown is gorgeous!  I wore it to a New Year's wedding with silver shoes.


Very nice dress; I'm only 5'1 but thick so it wasn't too long with my heels...


This dress looks and fits fabulous! It arrived in a large shipping envelope, so I had my doubts, but out of the bag, its great, just needs some steaming, and hemming up for a perfect and comfortable fit! Very impressed!


Beautiful dress for 1920s party or any fancy event.  Im 5'11 curvy and the dress was gorgeous for the price. True to size.


I liked the dress, it was very pretty.  I bought it with a summer wedding in mind, but I feel it would be too heavy/warm for that occasion.  The quality of the dress was very nice, the bead/sequin work was incredible. I've decided to go with a cooler, short dress for the July wedding.


Received soooo many compliments on this dress. Size XL  I'm 5'6",,No issues at all. It was long, so I wore 3in heals. Love it!!


Both this for my mother as mother of the bride she look great.


I tried it on and WOW-it looks great on and it felt amazing.  The fabric is NOT scratchy and comfortable.  I can not wait to wear it at the benefit I am going to next Sunday.
