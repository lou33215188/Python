Beautiful dress that fits perfectly.  The lace around the neckline is beautiful.  Bought to wear to our 3rd Annual Fur Ball benefiting animal rescues and shelters in our town.  Can't wait to wear it April 1.


Dress arrived today!  It is beautiful!  Fits very well and length for 5'10" should be just right!  Very comfy and should be easy to wear for a full night of fun at our son's wedding!  Thank you!


I am amazed at how great this dress looks on!  I NEVER wear form-fitting dresses like this, but this one is so flattering! I am very pleased with this dress.  It fits beautifully.


I love it â�¤my 25 birthday!


Bought for an holiday Christmas party absolutely love it!!! Will post pictures when Iâ€™ve worn itğŸ˜�


The dress was beautiful,  we really loved it,  but it was too small for a person that wears a woman's size 22W.


This is a beautiful dress just didn't fit me, had to send it back.


Liked the dress. I ordered a small but fit like a medium. Unfortunately there was no way for me to tell on the dress if the size was accurate so I returned it and did not order a new size.


I wore this to a wedding and got so many compliments. The fit was amazing and it looked so fancy on.


Though I haven't attended my party yet, I was very pleased with the quality and fit of this dress.  I am about 5'5'' and 145 pounds.
