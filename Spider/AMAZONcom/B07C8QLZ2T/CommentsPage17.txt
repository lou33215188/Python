This dress, is more wonderful than you can imagine... The first one I purchased was a little small, the return was taken back, no problem at all and I was immediately sent the 2nd (larger)dress. I felt like a million bucks wearing the dress, it was easy to accessorize,  it felt so beautiful.


It was easy to put on, so easy to wear,.. I hope I have more occasions to wear it, it's just beautiful!


I ordered this dress as a surprise for my mother. We had a black-tie wedding to go to that Sunday (it was 11pm Tuesday when I ordered!) and she was freaking out because she didnâ€™t have anything to wear.


On a whim I ordered this just so she could have it as a â€œback upâ€� and I liked the fact there were free returns. My mom LOVED the dress so much she didnâ€™t even look for a â€œfirstâ€� option! At the wedding she got a ton of compliments and everybody wanted to know how she found a dress that fit her so perfectly.


Do not let the low price tag on this dress turn you away if youâ€™re shopping for a formal event. This gown is of great quality and could easily pass for a $200-400 gown!!


this dress is far beyond what I was expecting it fits beautiful and true to size, has a little stretch and hugs your curves perfect. if you look super close there are small imperfections but for 40 bucks you really can't go wrong. the only odd part is the bottom mermaid part of the dress is one sheer layer of material with another sheer layer underneath that hits mid calf, it's a little awkward so I'm considering cutting it out...but I'm totally keeping it..where else can u find a formal dress for 40 bucks?! I am 200 pounds and 5 foot 7 and ordered the 14/16


I got the size up, because I didn't want to be really form fitting.  I could have gone with 2XL.  This let me be super comfortable and be able move.  One thing to note, sitting on beading is uncomfortable.  Either don't sit in it or wear more padding on your butt.  ;)


I dont want to give a full review yet but i got the dress and it was to small im very curvy im 5â€™4â€� and about 240lbs it stretches from the middle but not so much from the last line of beading at the bottom so i returned it and got the bigger size i wear size 16 jeans so i got the 18/20 but it didnt fit so i returned it and got the next size up which is i think 22/24 and i hope it fits good! ğŸ™� overall i think its a really nice and elegant dress.


This dress was fabulous! I wore this for a black tie fundraiser and it was perfect! It has just the right amount of sparkle, without looking over done, very classy. I typically wear a size 10 in dresses, but I read many reviews that stated this runs a bit big. I ordered the 6/8 and the 10/12 just to be on the safe side, and the 6/8 fit perfectly. I'm 5'2" and about 130lb. It is quite long, and needed to be hemmed up. I'm not sure why, but some of the other reviews state that the bottom mesh part is see through, and mine was not, mine looks exactly like the picture. A great dress at a great price!


For being a medium size man this dress fits good. Jk. My wife is wearing it to a masquerade party she wears a 6/8 and that's what size I bought. Thank you


BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL DRESS! I was scared ordering through Amazon since I will be wearing this to a formal wedding, but it is perfect. Unlike other reviewers have noted, it does have stretch. Unless they received a different dress..I was going to go a size bigger but after thoroughly reading reviews went with the large and hoped for the best. I'm glad I did, because it fits well. I'm short so I will have it hemmed but other than that I'm so happy. Beautiful dress that did not break the bank!


The first dress I ordered wa a bit small. Iâ€™m an 18 but needed the 20. It was perfect for an event for Work that had a 1920â€™s theme. Loved his dress so much. I even won best dressed.


The dress certainly had potential, it is pretty. I had some issues though. Iâ€™m 5â€™9â€� and even a 6-8 was too short (and too loose despite me being a true size 6), so fit is not on the strong side. The zipper doesnâ€™t move well and gets stuck frequently. Worst of all, it came covered in cat hair (and even a few long strands of red hair), clearly a return item that couldnâ€™t possibly have been inspected upon return. With the amount of hair all over it (and missing sequence/beading), I think itâ€™s safe to assume it had been worn beyond the just trying it on stage. I would not recommend buying from this seller.
