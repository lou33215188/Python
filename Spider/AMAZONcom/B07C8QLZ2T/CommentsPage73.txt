Absolutely beautiful. Would recommend buying it


Great fit great price!


The dress fit perfectly and I am happy with it. Though the reason for 4 stars is because it has little loose threads everywhere and I can't pull them because if I do it will ruin the bead work. Other than that it's a great dress.


Gets sparkles everywhere.


Love the dress and it true to size.  The bottom is a little more see through than I expected but overall nice dress for the price.


It fit well and looked nice. I didn't notice any discomfort when wearing it.


I wasn't sure about this dress. But after receiving it and trying it on. It worked. Used for a Great Gatsby themed work related party. Would recommend a slip for the skirt, its some what see through. Great buy over all, would recommend, especially for the price. Hope this helped


What a beautiful dress! Worth much more than I paid.... just beautiful!ğŸ˜Š


Just have to order it a size smaller than you wear.


A beautiful dress. The price is great for this dress.
