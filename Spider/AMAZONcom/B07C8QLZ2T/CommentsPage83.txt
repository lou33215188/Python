Had to return. So bummed - it's beautiful.


Loved it and fit as expected!


Beautiful dress. Unfortunately it was way too small. Sending it back.


High quality and looked really nice.  It was a 1920's theme for a Mardi Gras ball.  This was in keeping and still very glamorous in appearance.


Great dress and quality fir the price


Itâ€™s realy pretty. Made well


I absolutely love this dress! The material is wonderful and it fits perfectly!


Beautiful!!! Much better quality than I expected. I had to have it hemmed but still a perfect fit! Love it!!


I love the color but didn't like how it fit. Too large in some areas and yoo small in others.


It's a good quality dress, but it didn't look good on me. I thought I looked liked an old lady in it so I had to send it back.
