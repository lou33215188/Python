Loved this gown!  I did cut out the knee length lining as it showed too much and looked bad.  I would have liked if the lining went the full length of the gown


This dress was PERFECT for my wedding!


Bought this to wear as a mother of the bride dress. Very impressed with the quality! Had to have a few alterations but so glad I purchased. See attached photos.


Pretty dress. Good fit. The size 6/8 fit my 142 lb, 5"5 height, 36B, type body well.


I have had the worst experience with this seller. BUYER BEWARE!!! My dress was falling apart beads where falling every where..


So so pretty. The sparkles are great and the fit is great. The bottom is sheer but is a full fit.


much better than I expected. very pretty


Amazing dress!


It was beautiful. I loved it. But had to give it to someone else because I couldnâ€™t fit in it. Zipper was nearly stuck. Had to be careful not to rip fabric while zipping up. Overall not a bad product for the price. But orde a size or two bigger.


Love it... but would suggest going up a size for busty women.  Very pretty!!!!
