Dress was amazing and it came a couple days early


Nice dress but it's too big and too long for me.


Cute.


Fits perfect but recommend a Body form slip


Very nice, especially for the price.


my dress was perfect thanks


Great!


It looked like the pic picture and fit as expected!


Fit perfect, came exactly how it looked in the picture. Very satisfied


First of all, the dress is absolutely beautiful and very well made.  The beads are sewn on and none fell off during shipping.  I am 5'3" and 150# and ordered a size 12 in navy. I wear size 12 in jeans and it fit perfectly except in length (which I expected).  The downside is that the dress was not flattering for my body shape.  I have a tummy and it accentuated it. Even with spanx, the dress did not hide my stomach.  Sorry to say I had to return.
