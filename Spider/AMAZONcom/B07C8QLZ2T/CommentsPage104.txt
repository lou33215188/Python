I love love  my dress it fit perfectly I will be ordering again soon thank you


I loved this dress. It's gorgeous and looks expensive. Fit me perfectly.


Beautiful dress. Never thought I would wear sequins. Wore it on a cruise and received soooo many compliments. 5 stars pretty guide.


I have no issue with it other than the color. I was originally going to get green but it ran out of my size just before I was able to buy it. Other than that it fits perfect and I'm excited to wear it!!


It fit as I expected


Love this dress


True to size perfect fit. If between sizes go up and you should be good. Nice comfortable material.


Very nice dress but not the color I wanted or order.  A bit disappointed because I needed it for a function I was attending.  Will have to send it back.


I was so worried that it wasn't going to fit but I am glad I ordered a size up and it zipped up perfectly!  Can't wait to wear it!
