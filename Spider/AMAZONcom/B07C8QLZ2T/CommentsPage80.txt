Pretty, but had to return due to my daughter didn't like it for prom. Plus, the sequins looked like about to fall off. But seller was great about returns, so was Amazon!


wasn't too sure when I placed the order, but it fit perfect. like that it has material you can move in and was designed great!!! love the vintage look! would definitely order from them again!


While the top of the dress is beautiful, the bottom is cheaply made and quite see through. I didnâ€™t wear it after all. Glad to have purchased a back up dress!


Evidently I fall slightly between sizes. Although the dress fit, I felt it would be too snug to spend the entire evening in. I ordered the next size up and although I have a little bit of extra room, I like the way it fits.


I love the color and it fits good.  it is forgiving there is give in the material.


Dress was beautiful. Fit great. The one sent had a issue with the beading rolling up at bottom. Quality was pretty nice.


Beautiful dress. The sleeve openings are a little snug but the dress is lovely and arrived quickly.


The dress is beautiful. Unfortunately my daughter didn't like the fit, and the style once she had it on. So I returned the dress.


It was pretty, however, I am 5.2 ft so the dress was too long.  As far as other measurements, they were on point.


This dress was absolutely stunning. It was very true to size and appeared to be of great quality. I wore this to and anniversary wedding for my grandparents and received numerous compliments.
