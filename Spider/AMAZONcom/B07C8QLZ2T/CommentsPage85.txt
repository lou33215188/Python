This was comfortable and just as advertised. I got lots of compliments when I wore this dress.


Love it


Thank you, it fits great.


Beautiful dress!


The dress is beautiful on.


I ordered this gown for a formal gala I'm attending and was nervous about the fit due to still having a bit of a baby pooch. The gown is very forgiving and doesn't hug my stomach creating that pregnancy look. I ordered a 14/16 and it's a perfect fit. I'm 5'7" and 220 lbs


The dress fits nice and as expected. However, I am returning, as I do not like the bottom sheer piece as it is "too see through" for where I was wearing the dress. I have it in another color and the fabric didn't show as much.


Love love love this dress


The dress is cut smaller then my regular size. I had to return it.


The dress looked much better than I thought it would.  It fit well and true to size.
