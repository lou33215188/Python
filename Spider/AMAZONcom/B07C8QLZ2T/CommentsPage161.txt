little biger but it's very beautiful.


I am 5'5" and this dress fits very nice. It fits true to size. The dress comes in various sizes. The fabric is polyester and has tons of sequin on it.The dress has silver sequins on it.  This a perfect party dress you can pair this with a black shawl of fur scarf and a clutch. It would also look great with silver jewelry. The skirt is made of soft flowy fabric that looks as shown here and isn't just a straight piece of fabric. The dress has cap sleeves I'd say and is close to being sleeveless. I had no issues getting in and out of the dress. The skins do not make my skin itch. There is a large V shaped cut in the back. But it isn't backless. I do fear poking a hole with my heel in the dress every time. Sizewise, I was not disappointed. Do not machine wash.

Good quality but returned because it was too snug - clung to every curve.


Very sad that when I finally gave this as a gift the size was WAY OFF and there's no way to return/exchange it.


Beautiful dress. Fits perfectly- Really smooth transaction

Great. Ordered it for the Roaring 20â€™s ball.


My daughter loved the dress, it's a beautiful dress and it was flawless on my daughter for her senior prom.


The dress is absolutely beautiful,  well made, a very quality Couture design. Unfortunately,  just not for me.


The Dress is really Wonderful, the problem is the color is like an orange.  Thank you
