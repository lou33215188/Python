Beautiful dress!!!!


I wear size 8-10 so I wasn't sure what to buy. I purchased a 10-12 and it was too big, then bought the 6-8 and it fit perfectly. The problem with this dress that makes it look cheap is the seamline on the chest. It should be sewn with nude thread to match the fabric, not black so it stands out... if the first dress fit, I would have changed the seam myself. But the second dress that actually fit has a serger seam across the chest!! What the heck?? It makes it look sooooo cheap. Those seams belong only underneath clothes. My last picture shows all the beads and thread that came off when I laid it on my (unmade ğŸ˜�) bed.  Also I looked at all the pictures hoping to pick a dress that didn't have the second layer that falls at the knee, this one did. I so wish this would have worked, but it's bad.


Loved wearing this dress!!!


Dress is beautiful and fits well.


Beautiful!  I love it!


I bought this for my daughter for homecoming. The quality is fantastic . I couldn't believe how great it actually was, it looks way more expensive than the 50$ asking price. It actually has beads sewn on the dress. It was a little long on her , so he had the front hemmed a little, but shes only 5'ft1 and is wearing flats. It fits as expected, and its stretchy. Fantastic dress!


The dress is gorgeous and looks a lot prettier in person. The navy blue color is on point. The shipping was on time. However, the dress made my hips look square and I am a very curvy girl. I'm taking it to the seamstress (with the dress being such a great low price, I can afford a seamstress on this one) to see if there is anything she can do. In fact the dress makes my whole body look like one big rectangle.


This dress is absolutely gorgeous!  Bead work is exquisite!  It is nice and heavy and the bottom flows beautifully!  Fit as expected, I ordered the 10-12, normally wear a 10 in pants and fit perfect.  Not too tight, not too loose.  This is the second dress I have ordered from this company and would highly recommend!


Absolutely beautiful dress for a great price. I could not believe how fancy it is. I thought it was see through but it's not. The size I ordered was a 10/12. I was worried the top would be too large as i am small up top, but it formed beautifully. I will certainly look here again.
