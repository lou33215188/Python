Was worried about fit as I would normally order a large, however after reading reviews went with medium. Glad I did!


Dress was not true to size and the color was off


The dress was nice; I'm just too big for it.


So beautiful my daughter loves it. ❤️


This is a beautiful,  well made dress! I would buy again from this seller.


Quick ship,  great value, great fit!! I was very pleased with this purchase.


Dress has a nice fit and stretches to form. Wore it on a cruise formal night and received many compliments.


I ordered this dress for mom to wear at my wedding and she loves it. It fits perfectly and is  at an affordable price.


Looks very cheap. Sheer fabric is not good quality. Disappointed.


Absolutely love this gown!!! Very classy , slimming and just down right gorgeous!
