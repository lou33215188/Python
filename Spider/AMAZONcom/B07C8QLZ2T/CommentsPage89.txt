Dress is very delicate. Zipper is very delicate. The beading is very delicate. Order dress in a 18 (xl) and the dress is tight. I would return it but I need to lose 5 lbs anyway. But the dress is super pretty.


Would have been great, should have ordered at least one to two sizes up.


True to colors, fit to size. Free shipping and free returns.


Wow, for the price, it looks as good as something  I would pay $200 or more for. I just love it and it fits me well. I can't wait to wear it next month!


I should have trusted the reviews. Amazing dress with a tragic zipper flaw


Very elegant looking dress.  The dress is well put together and fits perfect.  I wear a size 7/8 or 9/10 depending on the maker.  I ordered a medium and it fits great!


bought this for my 21 end of prohibition party and I got so many compliments. I was worried I would need a petticoat, but the dress fit beautifully without one. High quality (especially for the price)


This dress was fantastic. It fit perfectly, though it had to be hemmed, which I expected. The material felt very high quality, especially for the price. I LOVE this dress and plan to purchase more items from the seller.


The quality of this dress was Fantastic.  I bought it for a Gatsby Birthday Party and was told I looked Stunning.  It looked like a dress one might pay $225.00 for.  Great Quality and price!!!


Beautiful, but runs a little big and the lining was shorter than the dress.
