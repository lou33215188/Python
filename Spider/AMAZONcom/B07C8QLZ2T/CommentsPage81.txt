Super cute dress! Fits as expected too! Giving 3 stars for quality. The dress arrived split open at the seams where the zipper is. Other than that, it would have been 5 stars


Beautiful dress.  I order a size 14/16 and I'm busted, it was a little small around the bust area.


I had a Silver & Black Birthday Party to attend. Dress was perfect and comfortable! Loved it! So did others.


Fits great.. I am 5’2 so am having it hemmed. It’s exactly what I wanted for a play!


Great value.  Great fit and nice material.


Wore it for my son's wedding. Fit perfect. #HotMomOfTheGroom


I loved the rope of the dress but the bottom fabric of the dress cheapen the quality of the dress so I will be sending both dresses back. I ordered 2 different colors and both were the same.


Absolutely LOVED this dress. The color was beautiful and it was relatively comfortable all night. Definitely worth the money. I am 5'8 and 140 lbs wearing a size 6/8 and it fit perfectly.


It fit great!! The quality was unbelievable. I ordered a medium I’m usually a large size 12 so it actually ran a little big. Perfect dress for my Harlem night themed party!!!!


This dress is very well built. I didn't find anything wrong with it. Very pretty and fits perfect. I decided that this wasn't what I was looking for. Other than that, I would recommend this seller.
