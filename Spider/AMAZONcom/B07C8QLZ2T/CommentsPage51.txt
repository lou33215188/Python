Great dress for the price!! Pleasantly surprised at the quality. The dress is fitted so be mindful of that.  Really great dress!!


Please buy this dress!! I recieved the dress in a blush and rose gold. It is stunning. I bought this for a fancy black tie wedding. Please just buy the next size up.


This dress is beautiful!! I am shocked at the price and quality.  I am 5 1, weigh 145 but I'm very busy at a 34 G.  The dress has some stretch and need to be shortened for my height.  I might have been able to go down a size but always need to fit my bust.  I typically wear an 8 or 10 in regular dresses but usually go up for formals.  The underneath slip goes past my knees so no issue there.


I was blown away when I opened the package containing this gown. I purchased it for a Great Gatsby Adult Prom and didnâ€™t want to spend too much but still wanted glamour. This far surpassed my expectations. The dress looks like I spent far more for it than I actually did. It fit perfectly and is absolutely gorgeous.


This is the most beautiful dress I have ever bought, minus my wedding dress. I bought it for formal night on a cruise and I cannot wait to wear it. I'll be looking for other occasions to wear it because it is so flattering.


Wife bought this for a formal event that had a Roaring 20s theme. Had me doing the Charleston when I saw her in it....


Very flattering for plus size!


This dress was beautiful and I got it very quick!!


I wore this to an awards dinner and got lots and lots of compliments.  It was very comfortable and the price could not be beat!


Absolutely adore this dress. It's a perfect fit everywhere except the hips. Same day delivery made it super convenient and I received a ton of compliments! Looked like a discoball, which was perfect.
