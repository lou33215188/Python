Itâ€™s so beautiful fits perfect looks beautiful on and for the price WOW!


Beautiful, quality dress for the price. I was unable to wear it as I am 6 feet tall and it was too short for me.


I love this dress! I am 5'3 and 208 pounds. I bought the size 18/20. This dress fit beautifully! Not too long without shoes and perfect with heels.


Like the reviews say - this dress is fabulous and well made.  I typically wear a dress size 10 and I ordered a Medium which fit perfectly.  Stunning detail.


As a pregnant woman, I needed a nice dress with plenty of belly room for my upcoming Marine Corps Ball. This dress fit perfect around my belly leaving me with plenty of breathing room, as well ;-) Great dress for the price!


Purchased the navy blue and it is absolutely gorgeous.  Haven't worn it yet, only tried it on but can't wait because it's so pretty.  I went by the sizing guide provided and it fits wonderfully.  The bottom is more sheer than expected but it's not a problem for me, just a warning to others who might not want a see-through skirt.


This dress is absolutely fabulous! I was unsure at first about making this purchase but I'm 100% satisfied. I got complements all night. I'm a size 14/16 and I ordered a size 18/20 and the dress fits perfectly.


Dress is pretty, it just did not look good on my daughter.


it is very beautiful, it was my mistake ordering the size I did, I should have gone up 1 size, but the dress itself...better than the picture


Ordered a size 20/22 receive and extra large too small now I have a dress I can't do anything with
