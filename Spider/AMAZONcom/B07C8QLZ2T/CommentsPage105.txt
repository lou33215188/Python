Ordered size 20/22 but received XL.  Beautiful dress not true size to American measurements.


The beading was beautiful...the bottom skirt was a cheaper looking material...not chiffon. It is not true to size. I ordered the 20/22...it was more like a 16/18. Thankfully my sister can wear it.


Love the dress fit just right it came faster than we expected


Medium might be too tight, and the large is just a little bit loose. I like the way it looks, but more if it fits well and tight the way I like it flows on my body


Just loved the dress, feel so elegant in it.  Purchased it for a Mystery Dinner set in the 1920's.  It was a little snug through the hips.


perfection.


best purchase i made in 2016!


will definitely purchase again. I got a medium after reading others reviews and it fit like a glove. 5'8 127lbs.


The color of the dress was not the color I selected.  I chose Champagne but the dress was more peach color.


It does run a bit big however it is a lovely dress and looks amazing!!!


Road a bit high on my hips. But it was lovely. I got multiple compliments and felt absolutely beautiful.


Arrived on time. Love it, its beautiful!
