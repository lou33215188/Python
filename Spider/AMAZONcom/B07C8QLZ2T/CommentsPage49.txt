I just loved the dress!! No one would tell it was really inexpensive! Worth every cent!


I ordered this dress on Sunday and received it yesterday, which was Thursday!! Right off, I love how fast the dresses shipped. I ordered a plus size for my bridesmaid. When I opened the package and took the dress out, I liked how beautiful it was, didn't feel or look cheap! I can't wait for her to try it on and see how it fits!!


Love this dress. It was elegant classy and sexy.  My husband loved it!.  I wore to my event everyone was star struck they loved my dress...


The beading is very nice but it runs a little small. Also the bustline isn't quite as expected. There is no added support or forming to the top.


Great fit, comfortable material, very elegant. However mine came COVERED in white cat hair and my husband and I spent over an hour de-furring the dress. Kinda frustrating to know that I paid for "New" and got "Heavily Used as a Cat Bed".


Great dress for the price. Fits nicely, looks nice, feels nice (not light weight/cheap feeling). The only issue I did have was the mesh around the neck/chest area ripped when I was trying it on. I didn't have time to send it back but it wasn't noticeable and I still received compliments all night.


I love the dress so far and the fit is on point.  My function is in June so have not had a chance to wear it yet.


Absolutely gorgeous!  Didn't have to unzip to get on.  Really high-end looking.  No snagging or sequin fall.  A little long, and I am 5'8", much improved with with 2" -heels.  Usually wear size 12 in dresses, ordered L , slightly big, but I like this.  Perfect!


Fit perfectly! Beautiful dress! I had so many compliments! I'm 5'4 and135 lbs, the size 6/8 was perfect! The skirt hit the floor flat footed.


Loved this dress and received so many compliments. I'm 5'7 and 150 lbs. I ordered a M. The length was perfect and it fit great. Has a little stretch and is very comfortable.
