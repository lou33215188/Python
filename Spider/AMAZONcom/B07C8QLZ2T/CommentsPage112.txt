It was a beautiful dress but fits too big so go down a size it's kinda stretchy


I got a ton of compliments! Fit perfect, took advice from other reviews


It is prettier than it It looked and fit beautifully!


I'm petite so it didn't flatter me. The dress was very pretty though.,


Product was great quality was just a little small for the way I wanted it to for so I returned it and ordered a larger size.


I LOVE this dress!  It looks even better than I hoped that it would!


PERFECT DRESS!! Buy Buy Buy


Beautiful dress. I was very pleased with the look and the price. Couldn't ask for anything better. Hopefully will order again.


I rely heavily on reviews when buying clothes online so I try to provide them myself.


I purchased the dress for a Masquerade event for work.


I bought the size 14/16 based on reviews I had read, I could've actually bought a size down. (Much to my surprise!!)


I'm 5'2, 180lbs, 36G - this dress fit very and flattered without the need for Spanx (a size smaller, and I'd have had to dig out the tummy smoother for sure!) the sequins definitely helped hide some little imperfections :-D


It was a bit long, even with 5 inch heels it still dragged on the ground, but the bottom half is basically see through tulle-like material so it had more of a floating appearance.  (Which worked for the theme of the evening)


I was expecting more of a costume feel due to the price, but I was very impressed when I realized the dress was very good quality and actually had some weight to it.  I will definitely wear it again.


Careful with the zipper...the fabric and the sequins tend to get caught in it if you are zipping in a hurry.


This dress also reminded me to vacuum the next day, the bottom half of the material is a magnet for cat fur! LOL


I love this dress! It fits perfectly and I would recommend it.
