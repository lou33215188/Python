Very pleased with dress.  Will wear at wedding.  Very forgiving.  Blessed to have arrived in time for wedding and very comfortable to wear.


This looks and feels cheap


Nice dress for the price. The only problem I would probably add if I had to is the delicate zipper.  I ordered a size bigger and it fit fine. Worth the money.


Beautiful, for my daughter's April Vegas wedding!


5'2" 38DD 150 lbs ordered a large probably could have gotten away with a Medium.


The fit was great. I got a sizes 14/16


Beautiful dress, but was too big. Returned and was refunded money quickly.


This dress is so beautiful and is true to the size chart.


This dress was beyond my expectations!  I bought it for a black tie event, and it was everything I hoped!  It fit perfectly, was very comfortable and exactly the right length.  So glad I purchased this!


Just great for my mom.


My daughter's dress, and it is Amazing!!! Have seen same dresses in local stores for 3xs amount.
