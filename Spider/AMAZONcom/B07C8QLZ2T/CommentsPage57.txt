Beautiful dress, and very comfortable.  I received TONS of compliments on it. Thank you!


Absoulety stunning love how it fits my body. Thought I needed a extra large but good thing I went with a large fits just right with just enough room to feel comfortable. Came in two days as promised now I cant wait for my office Christmas party.


I absolutely loved this dress,  received many compliments.


Beautiful dress, looks very elegant


Better on a different body.  Was very beautiful but didn't work for me.


It is perfect for my sister's roaring 20s themed wedding!


The curve in front was too high and material on bottom was too thin to compensate.


Great fit I am 6'2" so I needed to add 10.5 inches to the bottom of the dress


I had to return this because it was way too big,  However; the quality was great and I was impressed.


After reading several reviews, I ordered this dress for a Mardi Gras ball. It fit exactly pretty much perfectly. Would definitely recommend buying this dress to anyone who asks.
