Really liked this dress! Fit well and got a lot of compliments on it.


Bottom of dress was very sheer. Almost cheap looking, but the dress overall and the beading was cute. I'm willing to have teh dress altered to have additional fabric added to the bottom of the dress and wear it again.


Perfect fit!  Hugged my curves the way I expected it to.  Nice quality, no loose threads, no missing or hanging sequins.


Not for me. Cute but I guess mermaid dresses arent my thing.


My mom loved this dress! Good quality and style.


Beautiful, arrived on time. Fits perfectly


Fast shipping! Beautiful dress, lovely beadwork.  Fits perfect!  This dress does not look as affordable as it is.  I canâ€™t wait to wear it!!!


The dress was just as it was pictures. The fit was perfect and I look loved the design.


The dress was pretty but not as elegant as it looks in the picture so I was disappointed I bought several accessories to go with it and now I have to find something else to wear on my cruise. I did return the dress.


I'm busty so it's just a tad small but because of the stretch it fits me perfectly and I don't need any alternations.
