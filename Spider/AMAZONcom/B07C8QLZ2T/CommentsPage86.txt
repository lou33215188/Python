Love it!!  Fits perfectly


True to size lovely dress


I love the sequence,


but the bottom piece is thin and see through


I went by the size chart and got a 20w. I was able to put the dress on but not zip it up. It's a beautiful dress but does not fit


Absolutely gorgeous!!


The dress says itâ€™s gold and beige. The dress is more gold and pink.


A bit long but I am only 5'2"


Very Disappointed. Way too small even though I ordered my size according to the size chart. Had to return it.


Dress arrived quickly. Great quality. Very beautiful. Unfortunately it fit a little big and had to be exchanged. The return process was so quick and efficient. No hassle. I will buy again.


This dress is amazing true to size love it.....
