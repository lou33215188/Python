I purchased this dress for a Marine Corps ball, and it blew me away. The dress did not feel cheaply made at all. I got so many compliments, I felt gorgeous, and the fit was spot on. Absolutely would buy it again!


The dress is nice and true to size  the only thing I did not like is that the bottom part is see through


This truly is beautiful and for the Price it's a great buy was much more than I expected. I'm 5'3" and it dose fit long definitely I will need heels to not trip over dress but I do love it..


I bought this to wear to a black tie event and felt fabulous in it and got a few compliments. I want to wear it again. Size was perfect according to size guide and reviews I read.


It was the right size. I'm a 14 and that's what I ordered. Way long. I sent it back because I'm curvy. 5 foot 175lbs. It made me look curvier. It was beautiful.


Make sure to check the size and order a size larger that you normally would.  I order this dress for my niece and it was a little snug.  Beautiful dress though.


This dress is stunning! Fit perfect and was long enough @ 5'10. Very pleased with quality! Would definitely buy again!


Really pretty dress.  I purchased it for the holiday season...can't wait to wear it! I'm 5'9" and 200 and I purchased the size L  Really pretty!


Absolutely love this dress! Got countless compliments all night long! Fit perfectly, and molds to your body. I initially bought a size 6 -8 but it was a little big so went down to the 2-4 size and it was perfect. A little bit long but Iâ€™m only 5-1 so I just wore really big shoes :-)


Ordered a 20/22 which equals about a 2X typically. I received an XXL. A 2X and an XXL are NOT THE SAME THING when it comes to women's clothing. Essentially I received a juniors XXL runs 3 sizes smaller than a WOMEN'S 20/22. Order the 20/22 if you wear a size 16.
