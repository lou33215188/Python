This is a lovely dress!  I received many compliments and it was perfect for the occasion!


This dress is so gorgeous. Beyond words. But the dress in the picture- is not the dress I received. The dress does not fit me at all. I cannot even take a picture of myself in the dress without it censoring it.


I'm beside myself. I was so excited to receive such a beautifully themed gown, one that would fit my curves for my first night out with my husband in 4 years...and it doesn't fit at all.


Please, please, please, reconsider your size chart descriptions.


Beautiful dress that fits as advertised. Well made.  Very pleased!
