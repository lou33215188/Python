It fit perfectly I love it


Fits perfectly not too small not too big ordered my size and it was a head turner at a gala I attended. I'm 6ft all its slightly short but you can make it work. Must buy!


Perfect in every way, danced the night away


Beautiful and well made


Gorgeous dress! Has a little stretch so it was super comfortable and looked elegant for the charity gala I attended. I got so many compliments no one would ever believe the price if I told them!


Gorgeous.  Many compliments


So many compliments! I wore it as a bridesmaid dress. It's not very forgiving, but it is definitely beautiful! I wore shapewear under it to smooth out some lines.


Love the dress fix perfect true to size


This dress fitted my body really good. I think the neckline and armpit  could be lower.


The gown is beautiful and the material is comfortable and very flattering for curvy women. The layer underneath only comes to the knees, which isn't clear in the photo, but the gown is an excellent value!
