Beautiful


When I received this long dress , I was so happy. It is not too heavy and long.  It is light and shiny.


Dress fit like a glove! It was beautifully made and looked exactly as shown. The dress is true to size and has elasticity to it so it gives when you're on the dance floor and sitting and eating lol! As you can see I'm not small by any means and it fit well in all areas. I will be making this purchase again.


Beautifull dress, I love it , the size 6-8 is ok for me, usually I wear size 8, good price. I love the fast delivery, I will use at the quinceanera party of the years 20. Thanks Amazon.


The details on this dress is amazing! The only downside is it's too long and I was worried I would trip over myself, or tear the dress. For reference, I'm a petite 5'1, 120 lbs, 34D.


This dress was sheer perfection!! My daughter felt like a Princess in her 2x!


The beads fell off almost immediately. There were unfinished strings all over. Poor quality.


Wow! Just wow! The dress was amazing. It was a perfect fit. Great quality. I plan to order the short version of this dress from this seller in another color for my next event.


I decided to keep the dress because it was pretty even if it looks so fragile because of the lace on shoulder part. I received a lot of comments. It looks elegant and it's cheap.


Ordered this for my son's Gatsby-themed wedding.  It fits great!  Had tried on variety of expensive dresses at department store and they were horrible. I'm 5' 7", weigh 170 and ordered the L.  It was well-made and did not need hemming in my 4" heels.  The bottom section is sheer, and if I was young with gorgeous legs, no problem.  But being a modest grandmother, an inexpensive half-slip took care it.  I usually ignore reviews,  but wanted to share how pleased I was with this exceptional buy!
