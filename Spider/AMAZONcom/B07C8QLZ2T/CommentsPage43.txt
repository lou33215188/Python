Beautiful dress but size doesn't match chart. Order a size larger


My WIfe has enjoyed the Dress , it fits as expected, and the material is very good.


It was a good fit, 5'7", 190 pounds, carry most weight in my abdomen.


This was surprisingly comfortable. It was pretty stretchy, but chose not to keep it for the amount of spanks I would have to wear under it to not look lumpy.


This dress is so pretty and glamorous, you will love it.


I adore this dress! Great quality and absolutely beautiful! My only isssue was length but I am 5ft tall so I expected that I’d have to shorten it. Wore it on NYE and got soooo many compliments!


it is simply beautiful. I needed a dress for a 1910 era party and I ordered about 6 dresses to choose from.This dress fit the bill perfectly! it is beautiful.


Thanks every item fit perfectly.  I received a lot of compliments at Roarings 20’s Party.


Reminder you get what you pay for. This is an excellent dress for the price, but don't expect a well made gown. I felt like it was a little snug but pretty much true to size. If you are a bigger gal like myself, spanx are a must! Overall very happy with the purchase.


One must go up a size with this dress. However, it's a knock out. This dress is drop down gorgeous. I can't wait to wear it.
