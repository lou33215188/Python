I love it.  It's slimming and elegant.  I bought it to wear to my son's wedding.


It was very pretty but they said it was size 2XL but it was really only XL  so but larger.


I wore this dress for a Masquerade Ball and got so many compliments. Great quality, comfortbale and affordable


Very beautiful dress!


5'7" generally a 4-6.  Small fit well. The beaded bodice was slightly short-  wore black spandex shorts under it to give some extra coverage of important bits !..  But well worth the price.


Love this dress . It is even prettier than pictured . Can't wait to wear it to our daughters wedding !!!!!!


Perfect for Mardi Gras ball! The material has a stretch quality. Very nice at a great price!


Received lots of compliment. Very pretty dress


Very good quality. Beautiful dress! But the fit just can't handle my dangerous curves. Perfect for girls with no hips.

Free someone sold the first on I order from my door, I was shipped a replacement within 3days and it fits perfectly. I love it and I wish I knew it came in all black.
