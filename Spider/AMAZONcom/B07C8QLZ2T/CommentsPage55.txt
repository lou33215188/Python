fit well  everyone loved it at our roaring 20 benefit  The dress is fun to wear bottom half is shear  very nicely made


Beautiful dress and fit to size! Don't know what people meant that the dress was heavy, but it felt good being on! I love this dress! Got a lot of compliments and is very flattering. 5'5 and 145lbs and the 10/12 was a perfect size.


The dress I received was an extra large which did not match the measurements for the dress that I ordered which was in 1820 I was very disappointed.


This dress came and I was pleasantly surprised!! It's beautiful qualify and fits nicely. I did size up one because evening gowns usually fit smaller.


Beautiful dress but the 14/16 and 18/20 fit exactly the same and are still just slightly too small. I have curves and love to show them.


Runs 2 sizes too small... nice quality but didn't look quite like the picture


This item did not arrive as pictured or detailed.


was very pretty, but the zipper was so tight, could not zip or unzip the dress without fear of tearing the fabric. Did not try.


Absolutely love the dress!  I wore it at my daughter's wedding. I had so many compliments. It fit me like a glove. I ordered a size 12. I am 5'2 160lbs. Definitely recommend this dress!


The dress is pretty. It fit everywhere but around the thigh area. It's very tight and uncomfortable around my hips and thighs. it's also not tall girl friendly. I'm 5'9 and it's really short on me.. Other than that, it arrived quickly.
