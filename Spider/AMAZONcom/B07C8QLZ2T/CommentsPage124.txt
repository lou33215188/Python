Perfect fit...not too heavy, very well made


Beautiful dress but runs small


It was very pretty but was too long in the torso and boxy looking. No shape


The dress arrived and it is beautiful and it fits so well period it is true to size.


I was concerned about it fitting after realizing it was being shipped from China. Product fit and arrived 1 week before expected


The fit is perfect, it came looking exactly as expected. Great quality.


Beautiful gown, exactly perfect for our Roaring 20s party!


This is the first time I've bought a dress on line and am extremely pleased.  Will do it again


Beautiful dress just not true to size


This dress came from China. It was waaaaay too long for me. Absolutely no problems when trying to return. Thank you so much!!
