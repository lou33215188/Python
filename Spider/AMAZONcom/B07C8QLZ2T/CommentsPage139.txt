I was very pleased with fit and quality of the dress.


Amazing!!! I'm 6'3" so it was a tad short but it fit like a glove and is gorgeous!!!!!


It was better than what i was expecting. Fit is true to size.


Beautiful quality


I loved this dress. Fit great and comfortable.


It fits great.She loves it.


Beautiful dress! My daughter wore it to her prom, and it was gorgeous!


REALLY fun dress that flatters one's body and is comfortable at the same time.  Would definitely recommend.


Cheap material and not long enough for a 5:9 height


well made
