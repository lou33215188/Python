I have purchased this dress in two different colors and both are gorgeous and fit perfect!


Loved the dress but needed to return it as it didn't look good on me but the dress was beautiful.


returned and it was heavy and after seeing it didn't want it.


I hat to return it. I'm 5'8 and it was too short.


I love this dress, for the price point it's Awesome.  I'm truly happy with the purchase and I would purchase again.


Expensive looking. Beautiful and very forgiving.  Very satisfied.


Dress fit perfect. Arrived on time. I couldn't be happier with it.


it was a beutiful dress but it was a bit too small and it was torn on the sides by the hip at the end of the night


This dress fit perfectly for a wedding that I was attending. Definitely recommend for any formal event.


Stretchy material so it's forgiving. Little short in the back though. Felt like my cheeks were just an inch away from showing.
