I bought this for a winter black tie wedding.  It's very comfortable for a gown I think.  I weigh 185# but I'm only 5'4" so I required the 18/20 (although I do not have shapewear or a bra on in the pictures).  I purchased both the 14/16 and the 18/20, and the top fit a little better on the 14/16, so I will have to try it again with shapewear.  In 1 1/2" heels it pools a touch on the floor.  The upper section is indeed stretchy but the lower skirting is not.  The sequins are the only part of this dress that isn't soft against my skin.  I definitely think it looks like a much more expensive dress, and who would ever think I could buy a dress for less than half of hubby's tux rental! It looks gorgeous on the hanger, and everything that I don't like about it on is due to my own dissatifaction with my body, which the manufacturer and seller have no hand in. ğŸ˜‰ By the way, I was able to easily slide both dresses overhead without unzipping, so I'm not even going to fuss with it.  I have Prime so shipping was quick and free!


I am so inexplicably happy at how wonderful of a fit this dress was. It was comfortable enough to wear at a hot wedding in New York. I only wore some normal sized wedge heels and it only grazed the floor when I walked downstairs. The sequins were not very itchy, other than after a few hours of sitting on them your butt gets bead imprints.


 Other than that it's completely comfortable to wear. To be frank, it is also very easy to pee in. The dress isn't very stiff so it's easy to go in and just lift it. I am so incredibly happy that I chose this dress for my Grandparent's 50th year anniversary celebration. I got lots of complements!


This dress looks like a $200 dress. There is very intricate beading and it flows nicely. The real product looks better than the picture. I got the blue which is a deep midnight blue and got many compliments on it. I am 5'6" and 185# athletic build. According to the measurements I was to get a large. The large was too big but medium fit well with enough stretch to be comfortable.


I ordered the "mermaid hem burgundy" in Medium, as I was concerned about the beading/skirt being too short with the sheer only options (I needn't have worried). I'm 5'6.5" and typically wear a 4-6, but am pear shape/carry more weight in my hips, so mermaid style is hit or miss for me and I sometimes have to size up -- measurements are 35/27/39. The Medium was definitely way too big for me...go with the chest only measurement as shown on the sizing chart; there is give in the lower half, at least in this version of the dress. The length was good, though may have needed to trim an inch or so off, even with 3+" heels. If I had time I would send back and try a Small, but will have to go with another dress, as I need for NYE. The burgundy underlayer at the top neckline had a serged edge only, which I didn't love, but other than that the quality is very good for the price point, and the beading is well done -- really nice that the beading is front and back, not just front. Shipped via Prime 2-day as promised, return/refund was easy.


Beautiful dress! Iâ€™m 5â€™3 size 16/18 Bra 38/40D, it fit me great I had room to slip it right own without unzipping! I sized up to 20/22 bc I knew these dresses run a size smaller bc I ordered a flapper dress from them last year. Too give fuller look on the bottom I ordered a black mermaid petticoat for $19 here on Amazon! This changed the look from what looked liked hanging curtain sheers to Fabulous look! Itâ€™s a $69 dress and petticoat combo which is not bad! *My cousin also tried used this dress and she is 5â€™4â€� size 14/16 Bra 38DDD, it fit her nicely as well but she could have ordered an 18!


The dress has the weight of an expensive dress and I read many of the reviews before I ordered but had to send it back.  This was for my plus size wife and these are her comments.  The color looked more like a plum than a burgundy.  I know other reviews said there was stretch in the fabric but I did not find that to be true at all.


I bought the largest size and found the top to be at least two sizes too small with no stretch.  The zippers were very delicate and hard to use.  From the waist down the fabric was nice and had a good flow but is very sheer.  I think I may have had to also get a slip to wear if I kept it.


Now if your a skinny or average size I think this dress would be beautiful on you.  But big bused girls beware.  There is not a lot of room for the girls. Dress is nice but seems very delicate and would take a lot of care.


This dress is very pretty. The bead work is very elegant. However, I am normally a size 12 or 14 in dresses and the sizes to choose from were 10/12 or 14/16. I chose 14/16 after reading the reviews and it is a little large. I should have chose the smaller of the two sizes. The dress stretches quite a bit! I did not need to use the zipper and I have room in the dress. The quality of the dress is very beautiful! I would say stay to your size or a size smaller.


Overall the dress was fine, but it came with a defect in the left sleeve and I had to take to a seamstress


I ordered a few dresses hoping at least 2 fit well enough. This one almost made the mark. It fit well everywhere but over my hips. It zipped and all but I get like I would damage the beautiful beading sitting and such through the night. To be fair, I have large hips and butt. I am attaching a picture for those who need help choosing if this is right for you as I know pics helped me. I am 5'6" and an 18-20


The skirt is very light weight sheer net like material probably spandex and nylon, and is lined about halfway down.  The lining is a light weight polyester knit with some stretch.  The overdress is light weight sheer net like material (same as skirt) and covered with sequins which seem to be securely attached. The overdress is not very stretchy because of the stitching for all the sequins. There is a thin bead trim on the hem.  Some people commented that the dress was heavy due to the sequins.  It is not heavy like a beaded dress is heavy.  I measure bust 48, waist 43, and 2xl fit fine.  I am also very short and will need to shorten the bodice, but only a little, so beware if you are tall and plan to wear heels.  The armholes were well cut and did not gape.  The dress itself is very flashy, but I am wearing it as a costume for a musical, so that works fine.  It seems to be a hit among cross-dressers and drag queens which is always an endorsement!
