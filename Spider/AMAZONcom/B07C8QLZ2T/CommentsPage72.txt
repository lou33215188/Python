As gorgeous in person as it is in the picture. It completely fit as expected. The top by the collarbone and the bottom covering the legs are sheer. I'm 5'1" and it was a tad long with my heels on, but still manageable.


Purchased for a 20s party at work. It fits great and is as stunning in person as it appears online.


The only issue was that the bottom part is quite sheer and I don't want to say it but, cheap.  The top part is lovely.  We will be fixing the problem ourselves by sewing on a new bottom.  Would not purchase again.


This dress is very beautiful!! It fits true to size.


Lovely dress


The dress arrived as scheduled and is absolutely beautiful.  It fits very snugly.  Not sure if a larger size would help, or if it would lose its shape. Wore it to a 1920's themed function and received numerous compliments on the style and the color (the green).  Great dress for the price.


Dress was nice but it was a little big.


Prefect fix


Used this dress at a 1920s theme party we attended. It fits good, but just a little too long for me being 5'2" even with my 4inch heels.


Just beautiful! For a masquerade ball for my company.
