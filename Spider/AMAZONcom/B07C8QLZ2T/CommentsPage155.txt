This is the most gorgeous dress I have ever worn in my life. It fits perfect. Which I was not expecting at all. I got a 14/16. I thought about going a size up but after reading other reviews carefully I went with the 14/16 and it's amazing. Definitely recommend and I will be buying from this company in the future. I am just amazed.


Product fit was too large, should have gotten a large. also the bottom of the dress is made with cheap material. It ripped when i tried the dress on.


I received so many compliments about this dress! Great quality, especially for the price! Love it!


Absolutely stunning dress!  Wore it for a Hollywood themed Halloween party and I recieved so many compliments on how beautiful the dress was.  I'm ~5'6" and weight 150 lbs and the 6/8 was even a little big in the waist/hip area, but the rest fit like a glove.  The quality was excellent, no issues with the dress and very pleased with the purchase!


Very nice dress. It is fitting, but not tight. Very comfortable. The right length. I do not need to wear heals to keep it from dragging.


there is no slip what so ever!!!  the top half of the dress is made WAY to short!!!  I put it on and my @$$ was hanging out!!!  poorly made!


This dress was not anything like I expected! The reviews said the dress was so.that heavy and heavily beaded. It was not. There were a number of sequins though. The dress was also nearly 2 sizes too big. Not impressed and returned it. I have yet to hear anything about a refund. I also emailed appropriate return iformation fo4 the seller.


Beautiful, well made, I'm a size 8 & order a 12, should have ordered a 10.


gorgeous dress - somewhat retro but very stylish today


THIS DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL! LOOKS EXPENSIVE FOR THE PRICE, TRUE TO SIZE. FEELS A LITTLE HEAVY PULLING OUT OF PACKAGE BUT STILL VERY COMFORTABLE ON. LOVE.LOVE.LOVE !!!
