Beautiful!!! its looks AMAZING. I will buy it again in another color. The price is phenomenal. And it fits like a glove.


Beautiful! Great workmanship, super price


Im 5/3 and 128 lbs;  This dress was perfect except for lengthâ€‹.  I am wearing platform heeled shoes and its ok in length so I will have to have it altered but it is STUNNING and I CANT WAIT TO WEAR it.


Bought this for a 1920s murder mystery birthday party and it was perfect! Got so many compliments and fit very well (I'm tall with hourglass figure). I was able to enjoy the evening without being uncomfortable or itchy. Absolutely will order from them again!


The dress arrived on time and fits as expected


I'm size 20 5'7 40j 275 lb and it was a very snug fit in the 3X. My sis size 16 fit in it perfectly. We're the same height and the dress was slightly above my ankle.


First time I ever buy clothing online. I was kind of doubtful about the dress, quality of fabrics and stuff, but all turned out so well. Dress is good for the money it costed, fabrics are nice quality (doesn't look cheap). Little too shiny for my taste but it looked good. The length perfect with heels and fit very good, I ordered size 6.


beautiful gown, fits as expected. I should have gotten a size smaller but the 22 will do. It is very well made and beautiful in green.


I ordered a much larger size based upon reviews and it fit perfectly (I normally wear a Size 14 in name brands or size 2 at Chico).


Returned. If you have broad shoulders this is not for you. But the dress was nice amazing stitch work and all.
