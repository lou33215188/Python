I loved it! It was more than I expected.


I love the dress and color! I wear a size 12/14 and I am 5'4", 170 and I ordered a large. It fits good but too long, which I expected and will have it altered. I haven't worn it yet, but will wear it for a Black Tie affair.


Very elegant dress. The bottom of it is very sheer. I had to wear a slip with it, just not comfortable with


showing that much leg of a very special occasion.  My husband loved it. It is very faltering.


Fit perfect! It was a little stretchy so if you needed a little room it had a bit of give. You deffinetly feel sparkly!! But it's a gorgeous dress and I got a lot of compliments! It's also amazing for its price!


It was a pretty dress, although I bought a size up and it was just a little snug for me still.  It fits like wedding dresses/prom dresses where you have to go up a couple sizes.


Very sparkly very fun!


beautiful dress, well made, sadly did not look good on me so i returned it.  however i highly recommend it, very good quality!


It’s a beautiful dress. It’s not heavy at all. I’m 5”6.. it was a little long even with heels. It’s true to size.


This dress is incredible!


I ordered the same dress same size from vijiv and couldn't even get it over my hips. This one fits beautifully. It may run a half size small. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is bc it's short (im 5'4 and it sweeps the ground barefoot, so no heels), the arm holes are a bit small, the zipper SUCKS, and I'm gonna have to get a slip to go under it bc the beaded part does not cover my giant donk. It seems like the looser this dress fits you, the more the beaded section covers.


All in all, I'm super happy with the value for the price and im so happy I bought this.


Beautiful!!!! This dress is absolutely stunning!! So impressed....Especially since it was so reasonably priced!!
