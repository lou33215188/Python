I am 5'2 and was afraid it was going to be to long. I am going to have it hemmed a half inch just to be safe from stepping and tripping. All in all I love it.


Loved the dress and it was perfect for the Harlem Renaissance Pre-Father's Day Jazz Brunch. Thinking of getting other colors.


This dress was beautiful and was great for the Christmas ball I attended.


fit just perfectly! but the bottom of the skirt ( the black part) ended up being REALLY thin and looked weird so I lined it with more black tulle. which took some time. but over-all, i really liked the dress for the event I went to.


This dress is beautiful on me.  I am pleased with how it looks. I just feel that the quality could be improved.  I did notice that some parts of the thread was loose.  Also, when I placed it on my white sheets the some of the black material was rubbed off  the sheet.


Very pretty dress but the arm holes were uncomfortably small. I had to return it.


This dress is everything that I thought it would be. It fits wonderful but zipper in dress sucks may need to get it replaced.


For the price it was beyond my expectation. Love the classy vintage look. Would definitely recommend this dress to everyone. Good quality and just enough bling


I usually order clothing 1-2 sizes big because I'm worried about it being too small. I read the reviews and people said it fit as expected and was a stretchy forgiving material. They were correct. I ordered my normal size and it fits perfectly. Very nice dress for the price!


Pretty but didnâ€™t fit as expected
