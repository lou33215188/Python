I'm am extremely satisfied with this dress. It's even prettier in person and great quality/material. You can't beat this price for this amazing dress


Photos online look great... but once I opened the package the wow factor was gone. The top champagne gold part was beautiful.. but the bottom under skirt was off color and tool was cheap looking. Also the side zipper was not sewn in well and pooched out a bit. I ended up returning.


It is a beautiful dress.  Beading and sequins sewn with good quality.  Seems very well made and looks exactly like it did in the pictures.  I am big in the mid section, so it is not very flattering on me, but that's not the dresses fault.  I will be keeping it and hope to use it for a future event.


The dress is beautiful. Everyone commented on it. Great quality and exact fit!


Wore this dress to a Hollywood Glam party.  It was perfect and fit great.  I'm 5'4 and 145 pounds.  Use the sizing guideline to find your perfect fit.


LOVE IT, AND IT LOOKS GORGEOUS, RIGHT FIT, JUST TAKE TOO LONG TO COME, WHEN I CAN WAIT LONG,  I WILL ORDERAGAIN


Beautiful dress! My daughter will use it for her prom!


The black bottom part is see through.  You will need a slip or some thing.


Love It


It looks better than the picture.


The fit was perfect, but I'm pretty tall at 5'9" and this was too short. I had to wear flats, and even then it hit my ankles. It was gorgeous and very comfortable, and stretchy!
