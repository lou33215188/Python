I was very impressed by quality and look :)


Beautiful dress, well done, not too heavy. I love it.


Love it..  It is beautiful.


This is a beautiful gown!  Fits perfectly.  Great value as well.


Its very pretty but too big. im a size 6 and the dress fits 4 inches loose


The color


nice dress


A little too small disappointed on the bottom sheer I thought it was gonna be a little thicker not see-through


Loved everything about the dress except for the length. I am 5'9" and the dress was too short.


The dress ğŸ‘— was very beautiful, but the fit was a bit too small , so maybe go a size up when you buy it â�¤ï¸�ï¸�
