It doesn't show in the picture it's see through on the bottom and the beautiful top part is to way to short for my comfort. But it is gorgeous.


The Dress was just PERFECT  for the Mother & Daughter Formal that my daughter and I attended! Size: 14/16ğŸ’›


This dress was perfect!


Beautiful dress!  It more than exceeded my expectations!


I bought a size larger and it was still tight throughout the body.  The dress was beautiful but i had to return it.


I love this dress...cannot wait for my son's wedding to wear it!!


I bought this dress for my mother's 60th birthday and it looks amazing.  She absolutely loves it and it fits perfectly. I can post a picture after her celebration next month.


Not even the same dress. Don't trust the pic. Returned it.
