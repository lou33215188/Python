Very elegant dress.  Fits perfect but probably runs a little big because I usually wear a medium but the small fit very well everywhere. Great quality for the price.


Beautiful. Perfect for event. Comfortable


Dress runs some and it seemed short in the length of the dress where the sheer part starts. I was very excited for this dress but disappointed once I put it on..


Looked and felt beautiful in this dress!


Beautiful beautiful dress...was complimented all night...you won't be disappointed


My wife love this formal dress.


Bought this dress for my mother to wear to a Downton Abbey themed party. She absolutely loved the dress, her only wish was the bottom part being lined all the way down.


For the price point, you can't beat the look! I'm 5 ft 2 inches, so I'll have to get it hemmed but this dress is gorgeous and fits like a glove! The material is stretchy so it will form to your body. Can't wait to wear it on my cruise in less than 1 month!


Beautiful dress but I had to return it because if fit my bottom perfectly but was too big up top.


Gorgeous dress!!! Just as pictured, fits well and very flattering. I received lots of compliments!
