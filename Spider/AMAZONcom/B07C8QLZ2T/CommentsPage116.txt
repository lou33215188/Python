I loved how the dress hugs my body.


Great dress for the cost


A little larger than expected, but easy to fix it.


Love this dress!! Great quality!!


Dress runs small order up a size.  I am very happy with the quality for the price.


Have not wore it as yet, but am satisfied with my purchase.


This dress exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend!


I cannot wait to wear it!!! LOVE IT!


I ordered the wrong size so I wasn't able to wear the dress. But I'll give it 4 stars for quality and material. Would have definitely worked if I ordered the correct size.


After trying on many dresses this one was the perfect mix for my age, 50-60.  Elegant, sparkly, and comfortable! I bought this for my daughters wedding in black and received many compliments. I can't wait for another occasion to wear it, very flattering.
