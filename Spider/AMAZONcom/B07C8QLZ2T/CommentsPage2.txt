I loved the way this dress fit and it was very comfortable. I'm 5'0, 140 pounds and ordered a size 4-6 (small). Very pleased with my purchase.


This dress was PERFECT! I read a TON of reviews and wasn't sure if I should pick a 14/16 or an 18/20. I decided to go with the 14/16. I am a solid 16, but it was my first time buying a dress offline, and I did NOT regret it! I wore it to a gatsby ball and it was AMAZING! I am 5'8" and it was a little short, it did not touch the floor, so I wore it wth flats. the dress has VERY good weight to it, my waist is 34" and my hips are 46" and the 14/16 fit like a glove!!


Let me just start by saying, this dress is stunning!!! I absolutely love it!


I am returning mine, BUT I'm reordering it. (In a smaller size.) I read review, after review. I even asked what size an XL fit. They said 16. Well, I'm a 16. By hip measurement, an 18. But I fit in jeans a 16 super comfortably.


So, I bought an XL and it's really big on me! It is a very stretchy fabric. I read on reviews that it wasn't.... We must've gotten different dresses, because this definitely is. (SEE PHOTO). I'm 5'3 & would probably have to have it hemmed 6-8 inches (if barefoot).


My hips are about 46-47 inches, waist about 37 inch sand I wear a 38DD. The dress is loose in all areas on me. It bunches at the zipper because of it.


I have purchased a large and it should be here Thursday. I'll update on fit, so check back. (It will say written by Amazon Customer because it wouldn't let me write two reviews. Only edit this one.) it is titled THIS IS MY REVIEW.


This dress was everything I could have asked for and more!!  I bought it to wear for my brother's black tie wedding and it was PERFECT!!!  I got so many compliments on it.


A few things to note, the majority of the bottom portion of the dress is sheer and therefore see through. I fixed this issue easy by wearing a pair of leggings under the dress.  Another thing, the beading makes sitting in hard seats (like church pews) a little annoying.  When you move or stand or anything, the beading scrapes against the wood making a crunching sound.


The most amazing thing about this dress to me was how easy it was to move in!!  I danced from 5pm till after midnight and never got uncomfortable in the dress once!!!!


I was worried about my extra curvy areas (I'm 5'7'', 225 lbs with D cups) and how the dress would lay.  I have to say I was very very happy with my purchase.  I ordered the 18/20 Plus but probably could have got away with the 14/16.


Perfect fit! I'm 5'9" 160lbs, ordered a 10 and it's just right.


I got a lot of compliments. 18/20plus I weight 242lbs


i loved the dress, but it fit too lose. i weight about 135lbs and i ordered a size 6 but it was to lose from arms and waist/hips.


I would have kept the dress but had to return it due to size and it was not right dress for a wedding


Absolutely beautiful! Wore to my son's wedding. Got so many compliments! Dress was well made, bead work was excellent! No need for a body suit underneath,but a backless bra is needed. I'm 5'1" 145lbs. and it came to the floor,with me wearing flats. This dress exceeded my expectations. Beads and sequins didn't come off easily either. I'll buy another, a different color! ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


This dress is absolutely beautiful.  Just what I needed to celebrate my hubby's birthday.  And just like many others here, I got many compliments as well.  I ordered the Medium (10/12) in which I typically wear a 10 or 12 dependant on the style.  This dress is very worth it and the price.....not so bad :).


the dress is very lovely ..i got compliments all night ..im 5.8 inches 216 lbs i took a size 14 to 16 fit me perfectly ..the only thing is i didnt like the length it was too short when i wore heels so i bought additional mesh material and had my tailor add the additional peice underneath to give it a more fuller and longer look so that my shoes wouldnt be visible ...i wore with a strapless bra ...even without the additional material i added  its not that see through there is an undergown ..its not that heavy either especially given the amount of sequins on it ...and another flaw the zip is on the side which i hated because i had to basically keep it half way over my breast area zip it up then pull it completely down it did not want to zip all the way pulled down because of the type of zip used....otherwise im very happy with it ...i would recommend this to any one you wont regret just take note of the flaws and you can have the most perfect dress which is also very inexpensive .
