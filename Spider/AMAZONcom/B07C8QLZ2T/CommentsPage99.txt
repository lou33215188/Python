Grear price


This was a excellent purchase for me


Gorgeous but the size chart is wrong fits a little big on my daughter but its gorgeous


This dress fit perfectly but it looks slightly peach when its suppose to be an beige color, in certain lighting I was asked was the dress Peach? other than that it was a very nice dress.


Very pretty.


Good fit and has a little "give" to it. Won't be too tight after I eat:)


Length is perfect, I'm 5'4" and wearing 2 inch heels.


Better than expected! Beautiful sequins. Wish the lining was a little longer therefore requires wearing a slip underneath but otherwise fit was perfect.


This dress is beautiful!


I love it. Fits perfectly


Size was much larger than expected, but they were amazing with the return process and even sent a size smaller quicker than I thought would happen.


Fits well, a little snug, GORGEOUS DRESS! very well made. bottom of skirt practically see-through though. Get it :)
