I honestly love this dress! It is far more breath taking in real life than the picture. I am 5'0" and 186 pounds and the 14/16 fits great! I do not need it taken in or taken up which is great. CANNOT wait to wear to my Prom!


If you are tall then this isn't the dress for you. The beading is also very scratchy on your arms. Returning.
