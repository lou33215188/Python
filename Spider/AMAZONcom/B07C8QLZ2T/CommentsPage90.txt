I tried it on and I love it. No complaints here. It'll look even better after I lose some weight.


Dress is Gorgeous, wore it to a Gala and received compliments the entire night. The only thing to keep in mind is, the bottom is sheer so you will have to wear a black slip underneath.


I bought this dress for one of the formal nights on the cruise I am taking in November. I wanted to have the dress in plenty of time in case it was too large or too small and I could exchange it. I received the dress today. Put it on and I love it.. It is a bit heavy in the top, but that is to be expected with the beading. Bottom skirt is shear with the upper beaded portion being lined. I can't wait to wear this on my cruise.

Beautiful fitting dress, usually I am a little nervous getting clothes on line but wow it fits to the T! Love it going to rock this at my Great Getsy theme party !


The dress looks nothing like the picture! I don't think that I was shipped the right size but there are no tags in the dress so you can see what size it is:(
