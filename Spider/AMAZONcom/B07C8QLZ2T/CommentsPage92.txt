I adore everything about this dress.  Perfect length, perfect cut... I will order every color.


Fast delivery and dress was well made. I look fantastic at party and alot of compliments. Thank you


Love the dress and the size is true to fit.


It is a beautiful dress. Fits a little big on me but I lost weight after ordering. Well made. And came on time.


In champagne: fits like a glove...


I love this dress. Something told me to downsize so I ordered a 10-12 instead of my usual 12-14 and it fits perfect. I look darned good in it too! .


Truly beautiful dress but way too small for me. Returned.


Way too large.  It is a classic look.  Would fit better on someone who is full figured.


Does not run true to size, I ear a size 12, I had to re-order the dress in a size 16-18.


I had pretty low expectations for this dress because of the price but it is beautiful and well made!!! It is well made and comfortable. Canâ€™t wait to wear it
