This dress is beautiful...It seems to be good quality. I can’t wait to wear it!


I loved it  On my neice


This dress is Amazing!!! You never know when you order online what it's actually going to look like. This dress is made very well & I can't wait to wear it ❤ Great value for money!!!


I will wear this dress for my cousins wedding, the material looks cheaper in person. It fits, ok. I am currently looking for a different dress but if I cant find one, I'll settle for this one..


Got this for  my mom, 6ft 260 pounds, it stretches and it was fitted,  just a few inches off the ground, was perfect for her


I am 5 feet 8 inches, 170 pounds and the size 10/12 fits perfectly.


Darling dress. The skirt is a little sheer but I think black nylons will take care of that. I wear a size 14 and this fit perfectly.


I’m a size 22 and this dress fit beautifully.  The lace and beading is of good quality.  This is a very good value, plus it arrived within a few days.  I would recommend this vendor and would purchase a dress from them again.


This dress is lovely.  The reason I only rated 4 stars was the bottom of the sequin part of the dress where it goes into the flair, it was very difficult to sit, it was uncomfortable. Does run true to size, I wear a med/large top and 16-18 jeans.  But please consider this dress, it was actually very well made for the price point.  Unfortunately, I returned.


After reading reviews, I ordered one size larger. It fits loosely but I'm ok with that. I'm 5'9", 200 lbs and ordered XL.  It's absolutely beautiful and I look forward to wearing it to our black tie Great Gatsby party!
