Beautiful dress! Very comfortable and fit perfectly. Color was exactly what I had expected.


A little short for my liking in the front.  But all around felt good to wear this


Not impressed at all. The trunk portion seemed too short. The stitching looked bad. It looks very cheaply made. She couldn't wear it to the dance even when we tried to dress it up with heels and accessories.  My daughter can look good in almost any dress. This one was no good.


This was a lot better quality that what I was expecting! The only negative thing I don't like is that the shoulder sleeves part keeps creeping up towards the shoulders but that is it.


Until the moment my daughter had not dressed, she had not liked it was different from the photo. When she wore it, she said it was the most beautiful dress she ever wore.


It fits too big and the material is horrible. A lot of Polly and Esther going on "Polyester".


The dress was larger than expected and didn’t hang correctly. I returned it.


We got the dress for my daughter’s homecoming dance. She looked beautiful and she loved the dress, but it was a little bit bigger than expected; not too bad though. The fabric she thought was more cotton-like but she said it felt more stretchy. It was a little heavier than expected but comfortable.


Not flattering. Donating it to Goodwill


Very simple yet beautiful dress!
