Love it


I wear a large but when i order things online I get a x large to be safe well the dress was nice but it was way to big I could use a medium


Color was good, but did not like the fabric.


Only issue is that the dress had a large hole in the seam area by the zipper,  luckily I was able to fix it.  Other than that it was a very nice dress


LOOVE THIS DRESS!! The material feels like its very high-quality and long lasting. I receive many compliments every time I wear it. This dress makes me feel elegant.


Wore this for captain's night on my cruise.. super cute!


The dress was somewhat too large. However, there was no packaging information and I was unable to return it for an exchange.


Itâ€™s okay


Definitely order a size or two up. Tight in the chest and front part is shorter than pictured.


love it great fit..... material nice and thick can use a belt if I choose to over all nice
