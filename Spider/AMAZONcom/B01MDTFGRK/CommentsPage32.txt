Nice cocktail dress. Only complaint is it's hard for the dress to stay around the shoulders. Had to keep adjusting all night or it bunched at my neck.


Hated how the dress looked on me. Was not what I expected. The material is also not what I expected. I wouldn't wear this dress. I give it a fail


Got this for a friends wedding - bridesmaids wear yellow. It fits! A little snug around the waist/chest area but looks cute!


Really like the dress and would buy it again


Yessssss plus size ladies


Beautiful. Nicely made. Daughter wore it to a wedding. The high li falls just perfect above the knee in front and thick fabric.


It appears I received a dress that was previously worn/returned. The zipper is broken and there is white stuff on the sleeves and on the skirt..Iâ€™m thinking deodorant.


Really cute style and fit! Super comfortable! It is made out of the typical plastic material a lot of cheap online dresses come in.


pretty dress, but size Small was too large. Perhaps Im too petite. I will try to return or exchange for XS size if they have it. Shipping was fast.


It's nice but the quality makes it more like a jersey dress and not something I would wear to a wedding etc, which I was intended to wear to.


Beautiful the dresses just like the picture as well as that beautiful cobalt blue it fits perfect in size to I wear medium and I weigh 145 and it is stunning
