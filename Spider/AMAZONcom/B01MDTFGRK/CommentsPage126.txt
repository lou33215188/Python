really cute & fits great- can be fancy or casual


Great dress fits well am about 250 pounds, 5ft 4inch and i ordered a size xxlğŸ˜„


I received my package today. I'm extremely disappointed! Looks like it was sewed together by a third grader! I'm definitely returning this item! Don't waste your time ordering from this seller! Dress looks horrible! I'm very disappointed with the material and the juvenile experience with putting this horrible item together!


Loved this. It was beautiful when I wore to my friends wedding. Covered my mom gut lol


Love it. true to size. I'm a size 18/20 and the 2x was perfect


fits nicely on my lady cool dress i like it


It served it's purpose, I was just surprised how high it came up on me in the front though.


No tag to tell of washing instructions, but fits well, and super soft.


I loved my dress


The small runs like a medium.
