Beautiful dress but a little on the transparent side.


Material was SUPER heavy & over sized.


Bought this for my partner and It fit perfectly. It looks stunning on her! Very happy with the buy.


Super cute but was too large


I wear a 12 to 14.  Im 5ft 5.  Big hips.  I got xxl.  Fits loose. Should have XL


LOVE THE QUALITY


I bought it for my granddaughter and she Lille it a lot.


The fabric is smooth and thick, which was reassuring for me because I wanted a dress made of material (spandex and polyster) that will last a long time through all the wear and washes. The dress is slightly longer than I expected, but I'm only 5 ft. 1 in. tall, so that's no surprise.


So much fun wearing this dress to my company event in Nashville. I danced the night away


Needed to return but never did. Just was too big and not what I wanted for my wedding. But it's a nice dress


Bought for my wife and she loved it, not to mention she looked great in it!!
