Bought for my sister in law for graduation and she loved it. Fit just right , the color was more of a brighter red than maroon.


IM giving it 3 stars. I ordered an XL- I am 5'6 and about 160 lbs. I like it, it def isn't the best material but it's pretty. If you don't stand straight up in it, it will accentuate your Tummy and that doesn't flatter me personally. It is perfect in length though!


The dress is very flattering and fits just as expected.  I highly recommend buying this!!


My only issue is that a seam was stitched a little odd and produced a weird gathering of material in the back of the dress.  Nothing a seam ripper couldn't fix!  Now it's perfect.


Adorable dress.  Fit really well. Lots of compliments. Totally comfortable.


Pretty dress but too big for me. I am 5 foot, 123 pounds, lean (14% body fat), 32C, and I ordered a medium after reading reviews.. big mistake. Should have went with small or extra small. The length was okay but everything else was huge!


Bought this for my daughter. It was very flattering. The material is very stretchy so I would probably fir even if she grows. I think a xs would have fit even better but they donâ€™t make an xs.


Absolutely love this dress!! Great fit and super comfortable!!


Fits great. Very cute. I didn't give it 5 stars because the color is more of an orange instead of red that was advertised.


Looked Great on me I Love the Fit and Style on me. The Blue Color shows off my Pale Skin.


Very beautiful dress and color. I ordered it for my daughter.
