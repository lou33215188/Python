Loved this dress for my birthday!! Perfect fit!


Was expecting different material. More classy


Way too short in the front. If it was a little longer,  it'd be perfect. I gave it away.


I love the dress. Fits wonderfully. Fabric is really good.


Looked great


My wife is very happy with this and I recommend buying it.


Not even close to the pictures


This was my first time purchasing clothing for myself on Amazon. The dress fit beautifully. Great material and breathable.


Pretty color, just a touch tight, heavy good quality material. I would recommend!


Looks so nice on the picture but the actual dress is not.
