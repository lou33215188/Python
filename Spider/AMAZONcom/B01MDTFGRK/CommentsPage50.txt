Such a cute dress.  I'm wearing it at my rehearsal dinner.


had to return it, it wasn't what i expected and it fit weird.


Very poor quality.  0 Star really but don’t get that choice


it's awesome... design , size, quality and color ....i give 10 star


Love this dress. The material is thick and it fits wonderfully. I ordered a medium and I'm 5'5" 150 lbs. The zipper is cheap so you have to be careful that you don't break it trying to zip it up but for the price of the dress it's great.


I bought this dress in a snap for a winter dance at my school. Delivery was fast. The dress fit well, it didn’t really come with washing instructions which was confusing. The top was a big tighter that I expected on me, but I do love how it looks and my boyfriend loves it. Overall, a good deal on a decent dress.


I wear XL on a regular. I ordered XL and XXL just in case. And the XL fit great!! Maybe I'll get more colors too. Loved it.


So I bought this dress in L based on other reviews. I have a big chest tho and it fit a bit tight in this area. It's a super cute dress but the material is a bit heavy!


Dress looks plainer than in picture and the material isn't the best. It does fit well and look flattering on though.


They didn't send the one in the picture.  It was totally different.  The dress was ok anyway.
