I ordered this dress for a baby shower. I’m always hesistant to order clothes because some run too big or too small. This dress was perfect. I normally wear a small so that’s what i ordered and it was great. Not too tight not too loose. I would def order more colors in the future.


Love this dress! Ordered it for my birthday, and it did not disappoint. I am 5'6" and about 200 lbs and a 36DD and I got an XL. Fabric is very nice, pretty stretchy and thick. Will be ordering another color!


Some seams not sewed well.


nice dress but size runs really small. ordered a XL and fit like a small or medium-tight had to return


Looks nothing like the picture. Material is cheap. And the pattern/cut is basic/plain


This dress looks just as advertised and fits well. The fabric is soft and moves well. Wore it to a wedding and got a lot of compliments!


runs small


Cute! Daughter likes and fits just right


Because it’s pretty stretchy I wish I had purchased in a smaller size. Overall it fit great and is very comfortable but wish it was a tad more fitted. If I wasn’t so last minute about my purchase I would have exchanged for a diff size


Perfect
