I love it! It fits perfectly, it's beautiful, and comfortable. It arrived quickly and on time.


Bad quality, see-through and cheap


Beautiful color and fits true to size but I could go a size smaller since it has a little give.


The arms are very tight.........the dress is ok


Did not fit well! A bit too big but material was good if it came in xsmall I would have ordered it!


worth it!


a little loose in the torso and arms but that might just be because of my proportions


Such a beautiful dress..cuts are amazing


Good material n classy wear


It fit as expected. Loved it!! Great quality..


Fit as expected
