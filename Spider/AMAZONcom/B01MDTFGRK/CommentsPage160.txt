I'm 5'1, 220 ... the dress fits great, I was nervous bcuz it's made in China.. I got it on with no problem, the length is great, polyester material is soft. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because the stitching around the neckline is a little cheap looking and I wish that that straps came up a little higher on the shoulder part. But other than that it is a really cute and flirty dress that you will definitely have to accessorize to make it really pop!!!  I got it in the royal blue shade and I'm going to wear it on New Year's with a rhinestone neck piece and rhinestone heels, my shawl will hide the stitching.
