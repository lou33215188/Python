Very nicely colored and fits me very nicely!


Great dress!


Really cute on and fits well. Runs true to size. Material is thick and soft as well


Came just as pictured and fits well. I'm 5'6 140 lbs and ordered a medium and it's cute and flattering.


I am usually between a xl and xxl so.i went with the xxl since its a form fitting dress and it fit perfectly the material is thick like a formal dress the color was exactly as the picture this dress is good quality


Item is too big and fits nothing like the picture. The material is spandex and the skirts just hangs it does not "poof" out as pictured. Would love to have returned but it does not give me the option.


Love this dress! Got my regular size but was a bit big on me but still love it!ğŸ–¤ğŸ–¤ğŸ–¤


Decent dress.


Bought this dress for my wife she wore it to a bridal shower and received multiple comments of have great she looked in the dress. The material is nice and thick but not to heavy. Great Deal.


Simply wasn't my style
