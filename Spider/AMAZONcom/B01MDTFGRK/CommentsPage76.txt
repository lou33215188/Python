Lovely! I feel like a princess in this. It fits great, but doesn't lay perfectly.


Cute dress for a good price. I got a lot of compliments when I wore it.


love it!


I love the dress! It was very comfortable and I was a bit concerned about the size becasue of the reviews but I ordered a XXL and it fit perfect.


As advertised


Doesn't stretch much. Runs small


I also don't like the material. Would like to return.


This dress is perfect. Absolutely gorgeous.


It's a nice dress but it was to big. She wear a small so I brought a small and it was to big.


This is the little black dress I've been trying to find for years.


True to size, fits like a glove. Material is soft.


And shipping was quick.
