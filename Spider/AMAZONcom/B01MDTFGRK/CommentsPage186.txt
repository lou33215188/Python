The quality of the dress is very well made. However I am normally an XS and this dress was too big in the bust area. I am normally a 32A. The front of the dress is WAY short but the cut is really cute so long as it fits your body style.


Cheap dress looks nothing like the picture. Tecture and color are terrrible.  Took weeks and weeks to ship from China.  Do not waste your money.


I'm 5'2" and 167 lbs. I ordered this dress in a large. Let me just tell you, I was not disappointed. In fact, I wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did. It's one of my favorite dresses now.


-Fits true to size


-Stretchy but not shear


-Fabric is not scratchy


-Lightweight


I love this dress. The fabric feels nice, non itch. The style is nice although I didn't think the back was gping to be so long but it's still super cute.


Fits perfectly, material seems a bit cheap.


It's cute and it looks pretty good, just not the material I expected. However that doesn't bother me too much and I'm keeping it because it looks pretty good


Love the dress, love the material


I'm 5'6" 155lb 34DD and the large fit PERFECTLY! I bought this in white for a costume and it is a little bit see through, but the material feels nice and sturdy. I will be purchasing more colors to wear out!


I loved this dress SOO much. Really nice material (a little heavy but I prefer that). The length is perfect for me (5'2") but even if you were significantly taller it would be a perfect length I believe...I just love slightly long dresses


What I love most about this dress is how the top is not gappy - it fits to the body so well that it is cute but also modest.  Have ordered 2 colors love this so much.
