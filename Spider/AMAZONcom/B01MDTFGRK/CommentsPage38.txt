Gorgeous dress. Not too sexy, very flattering. The color is darker and richer than expected but looks fantastic.


I loved this dress. I'm a little on the chubbier side and this was incredibly flattering when I tried it on. However, the zipper broke and shortly afterward, a hole formed. This dress was NOT a tight fit at all. I wish I could've kept it and worn it for the event I had originally purchased it for.


Size chart is accurate. I'm busty so I was really afraid of ordering this. I got a medium cause I wear a size 8 pants but I'm a 34DDD. It was perfect. Cut back in at my waist then hung freely. I love it. Thick material so it's not see through. It's great.


Love the dress, just does not lay on my shoulders like in the pic.


Go down a size. Also for you short girls, this will be very long on you. I am 5'3" and it is long, hitting at an award height on my leg.


The dress received was not what was pictured at all! I ordered the black in a medium and it was perfect except a little tight. So I decided to order the wine red color in a large and got a completely different dress that zips from the back. The dress fit, but was not the off shoulder look that is pictured. Hoping it was a simple mistake so ordering again to see what happens.


Not the greatest material and runs very short in the front


soooo nice! great material! was very surprised at quality, too cute! can't beat the price!


Ordered the green and the color is not a vibrant as shown but it fits. Im a size 16 and 2x fits great


Looks nothing like the picture.  Runs big. Would be a good curtain
