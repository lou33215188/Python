Plenty of compliments in my sexy plus size dress.


fit perfectly. i bought the bright red and i love it. originally bought for hoco dance but i can see myself wearing it casual. the bright red really goes well w some black wedges.


It was a very cute picture and the color is great. I was hoping to use this as my Christmas dinner dress but it came and the material is not what I expected and it is very large.


Too small will be returning.


Good material, definitely doesn’t feel cheap. I’m 5’4” and weigh 127. Belt also purchased on Amazon.


I didn’t have high expectations considering the cost but what I received blew my mind.  Uneven cuts, cheap material...looked literally like someone sewed two pieces a fabric together and didn’t even attempt to make it look nice.


Spend the extra money, go to a store.


Cheap material - seams totally visible. Very flimsy, cheap cheap cheap looking.


Poor fit and quality construction!


Love this!!! Its great for our upcoming cruise!! :D


doesn't fit or look anything like it does on the picture
