After reading the reviews I purchased this dress with high expectations and very high hopes.


The minute I opened the package my heart sank. The dress had a very cheap material. I decided to try it on and the fit was awkward. The best word I can use to describe the dress on me was unflattering.


Unflattering


Cute dress but way to small. I ended up giving it a friend because shipping it back would be more than what I paid for it.


I am very happy with this dress. I was concerned it may be too long on me since I am petite, but the length was perfect! I received so many compliments when I wore this to a wedding and a birthday party.


The dress doesn't stay off the shoulders wasn't to crazy for the dress


Love it.


I purchased this for my daughterâ€™s dance, what do I have to lose. Omg it was perfect and so classy. Everyone loved it!


Loved it so much we purchased it again in a different color!


Ordered this for a wedding. It's well made. Fits according to the sizing chart.


Very Pretty


Color is gorgeous. Fits great. The yellow is definitely see thru.


I bought this for my daughter for Winter formal. Its was a last minute purchase and I couldn't of been more pleased. She is 5'9 and 170lbs. I ordered large and fit perfect. Good quality material, and she felt comfortable in it all night. Would recommend!
