Very nice. Fits just right. The material is great :)


The dress fit nicely and received lots of compliments! Thinking about getting a black one!


doesn't look like picture the sleeve part....the sleeves are way smaller then picture...i had to send it back and the long one that looks identical to this one but long in back..disappointed..material really heavy...like a bridesmaid material..ugly...with pleetes showing around breast area....


Lovable !


The skirt was SO SHORT in the front. That said, I am 5'8" - likely too tall!


Arms are a bit tighter than expected, but fit great everywhere else. Skirt is very cute. Overall very happy with this dress.


I was really surprised how well this dress fell when I put it on. It Fit like a glove! I think I may order a few more colors! Itâ€™s a lovely dress for dancing. It has a beautiful flow to it. The wine color I ordered is gorgeous.


it was just awful! didn't fit at all, droopy where it should fit. Its going into the junk bag and will be given away......


While the fit of the dress was fine, the color turned out to be a lot lighter than in the photos posted.


love it
