Great dress.


To tight on my chest and front up to high almost to my knees


The color is dull and not as vibrant as picture.


Pretty color. Was very heavy material and it was not true to size. I bought it larger just in case and it was still way too small. Very disappointed


The material of this dress is very thick. It was a little bigger then I expected as well. I will wear it with a belt to help bring the midsection in a little bit.


The fit of this dress was not flattering for me.


This dress is just beautiful! You can't go wrong with it & the price is even better. Quality is very good. For reference: I'm 163 lbs and 5'5 ft and ordered a Medium. I love the way it fits.


Did not fit well.


it looks great with a silver detail in the waist


Great material.
