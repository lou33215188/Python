I really like this dress, I wore it to a wedding and it looks elegant with the right shoes and accessories


I love this dress, it fit well and looks amazing! I would've gave it 5 stars but I personally wish it was a few inches longer in the front. I am 5"2 and my dress was pretty short in the front.


Nice fit color not the same as in pic..but a pretty dress


Love the dress!! Wore it to a work event and everyone loved it! Canâ€™t wait to wear it again!


Read reviews and order up.  A little short in the front, but going up a size helps with this!  Wore it on my cruise and love this dress!  Will buy again in another color!


simple and nice


I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear, so I ordered an XL, got it and it was like a size medium. The dress was pretty just wish I could have worn it comfortably.


Great dress. Very comfortable. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it!


This dress came messed up. The stiching at the waist has large holes.


Though I was getting maroon ..
