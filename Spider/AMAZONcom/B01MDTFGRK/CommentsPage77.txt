It came in earlier than expected even with this snowstorm. the fabric is nice but I wish I had ordered a  size up but I guess it gives me a reason to lose weight Lol all in all I would probably order from this seller again it's a great dress


The dress is stained with deodorant marks, came wadded up and inside out in package. Will be calling amazon. Dress color is a vibrant blue, and soft material, which is why I gave it one star. Hopefully I can get an exchange...


I purchased this dress for a charity event and even though it was a bit of a wait to get the dress, it showed up just in time. If you need it for a specific date, make sure you order it early. It fit great and was comfortable!


Its too small


Awful.  It smells. Cut is nothing like the photo and the yellow is a awful mustard collar not bright like shown. It does not look professionally made, has very clear hem lines all over. Extremely dissatisfied.


lovely.. makes me look awesome..


Stunning dress


Runs a bit large around the waist if you are thin waisted. It is also a bit see through but only in areas where it has to stretch a bit more (like shoulders and chest) Other than that it is a very cute dress!


The dress fit well just a bit larger than I expected in the top half of the dress. It was a really nice dress and the length is perfect in 5'6 and usually wear a 15 in pants. I ordered a large.


Love this !!! Very flattering. The material is heavy. This outfit is so worth it.
