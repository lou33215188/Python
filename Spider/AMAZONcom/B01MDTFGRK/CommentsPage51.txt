I ordered a size up as I do in dress, especially stretchy material, and this fit perfectly. I am small chested and it wasn’t loose nor tight. This dress fit great and hit me just above the knee - the shorter front that is (I am 5’3). I am in love with this dress!


I'm 5'9 and have a long torso and this was extremely short in the front for me.


looks nice on my GF


Love this dress!! I usually wear a size 12 in dress, and the large was a perfect fit. I love the length of the dress, and being 5'3 I hate dresses that are too long, but this was a great length. very flattering, and I would but this again.


I bought it according to size and commentary on others who have a similar build but it did not fit well, had a zipper that seemed a little hard to tug as well. I may consider a bigger size in the future.


It very pretty and thick material. A good dress however it didn't arrive white it was more like off white or ivory. I needed a white dress for a party so I had to return it


I bought a large and it was too small...I thought about returning it but it was a cheap price so I kept it and probably will donate or give it to someone that can fit it


I love this dress. I bought it for a wedding this weekend and I don't want to take it off, I need more occasions to wear it. it's a nice material and stretchy, but the chest area is quite nippin if you don't wear a bra. It fits well (I'm 5'7 and 175 lbs and bought a Large)


I'm giving this dress 5 stars because I really liked the material and how it felt. The style is great. I bought this dress for a wedding, however I decided to wear a different dress. I wasn't comfortable in it but that is because of my body type. It had nothing to do with the dress.


These days I don’t buy fitted tops/dresses but this one peaked my interest, not use to the snug fit anymore but it is not uncomfortable and it is flirty fun piece.
