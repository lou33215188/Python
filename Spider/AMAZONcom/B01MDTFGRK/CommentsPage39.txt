Material was thin and it fit a little strangely. Definitely not for people with sloped shoulders.


The material is a little thick, but stretchy. I viewed other comments and purchased one size larger than I normally where and it fit perfect!


I do love this dress! I'm not tall, but I have long leg, so the front felt short to me from some angles.


Very cute. Zipper on the side. The dress is tighter fitting in the chest area, would suggest ordering a size up.


Bought this for my mom she absolutely loves it and it fits her like a dream sizing in on point quality is good will be wearing to her brother's 50th this weekend


Design was cute but had to return as it was way too small.


Runs true to size, fits and feels great! highly recommend


kinda to big for me the shoulder part is very loose i will had to find something else to go under this.


Came very fast I ordered my size according to chart... Little top heavy for this style due to nursing... But everywhere else fits well... So over all okay buy... Very durable material kinda heavy


I give it 4 instead of 5 because it is a bit see through. I will have to wear something under it or else you can see my bra . Other than that, I love it. I did think that the waist line would be a bit lower, but it could just be me.
