I order small size it was too big for me specially in the waist area. So I decided to return the item last March 27,2017. I still don't see any update in my return at all!! So if you have a return item please expect it would took long for your item to process and the refund too! Hopefully i recieved it soon tho ğŸ˜•.Btw I order red wine its nice quality!


Great


Super cute and well fitting. Love it  good material and zipper on the side. Fits as expected! Perfect dress for lots of occasions.


Great Buy!


Great purchase and fast shipping.


The stitching definitely could be better. The material itself was decent quality, but I think they could have done better making the dress.


Ordered up but still small


It's too stretchy and shapeless :(


I love it!! Fits as expected!!!


Beautiful dress. I love it. It fit perfectly. I ordered a large and wear a 12-14 with a butt.
