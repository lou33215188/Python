2 stars material is kind of poor. For the price not expecting a lot either but pictures are deceiving.


Ordered this dress to attend a wedding and it fit perfect.  Very comfortable and accentuated every curve. I loved the color. Great buy, for a great price.


The dress was too big wish it was true to its size very misleading.... the zipper was not sewed correctly


Dress fits nice and the quality is oka. But the color is way off.  I am very disappointed.


Fits me perfect.. Received so many nice compliments.  Love the dress and color.


Dress is wonderful. Nice material. Fits well. Only complaint is neckline is sewn crooked.


I have recieved more compliments on this dress than anything I have ever worn.


Very comfortable.  Not really really well made but I didn't expect it to be.  Very flattering on my curvy self.


My daughter wore this dress for homecoming. We ordered it in blue and it was exactly as pictured. The fit was very nice. We are very happy with the purchase.


The dress is big and the material is very cheap. Tried to return it, having problems with the process
