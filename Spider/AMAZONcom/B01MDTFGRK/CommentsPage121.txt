Cute.  Fits well and my daughter said it's very comfortable.


Bought it for $11.99 you get what you pay for no tags or labels looks home made not happy


Too small in the front it fits fine but too small in the front area


Like the material. Thick.  Great color yellow got for summer outdoor party. Ill buy again another color. Recommend
