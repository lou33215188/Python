Perfect! Ordered the dress to wear to an evening wedding and it's absolutely stunning! I'm 5'4" 201lbs and I'm wearing an XL here in this picture. Hope this helps you ladies!!


Bought this dress for a trip to Vegas and it fit great! I ordered XL and I am 190 pounds. I hope this helps.


LOVE THIS DRESS IT WENT GREAT WIT MY SHOES

Fit well. Thick material. Everyone loved it. I just didn't like the zipper.


I am 5'7 and 150 lbs, I ordered a medium. Nice dress for the money. You're going to need a padded strapless bra.


Loved the color


Wore this for my graduation and loved it! The dress is absolutely comfortable and fits perfectly. Unless people were lying to me, they claimed they liked it as well.


Love! Love! Love! Fits great ğŸ‘�. Nice thick material. Non-itchy. I WILL buy again in a different colour. I'm in love with this dress. True to size. My new favourite dress. Shipping was fast (Jamaica, Caribbean) and i got the same colour and shade and size that i ordered. Definitely recommend! You will LOVE it too


Purchased on short notice for a wedding. LOVED!!!  The material is great and very comfortable. Simple but elegant. Worth more than the 19.99 I paid for it. I will be getting it in black also.


Wore this to a wedding, and I loved it. Fit perfectly and very comfortable. I'm 5'4" and 120lbs and the small was just right.
