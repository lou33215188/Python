Super cute, simple, and very comfortable! My daughter loved this dress for homecoming and you cannot beat the price.


Great dress. Material a bit silky feeling. Can be simple and dressy depending on how you dress it up. Worth the buy


This dress is very cute and perfect for the casual wedding I’m going to in April. I am 5’8 140 pounds and ordered a medium, which was too big. I returned it and got a small which fits. The color is very cute, but depending on what size you order will differ slightly, as well as the material. The medium was a much thinner, softer material and a paler yellow than the small, but I still am happy with the dress for the price!


Loved this dress...got this dress for a Mexican party....just what I wanted...fitted perfectly and Got lots of good compliments!!!


breast area fit great.. waist a little loose, but my husband loved it so I am keeping it.  for reference I am 5/6 weigh 145, and 38 chest, 28, 40 hips......


This dress fit slightly smaller than I anticipated and was a little too short, but it worked well for the costume I wanted it for!


Nice go-to dress for going out, pretty universally flattering! The shoulders can be worn as completely off as the model has them or a little further up to cover bra straps, and it cinches all the right spots. The fabric is fairly heavy, so nice for fall/winter


was perfect to use as a belle costume, and looked good on. wouldn't stay off the shoulder very well. the fabric was a good weight, not too tight


Really pretty. I love the color.


Not as great quality as I expected. Material is different from what it appears in the photo. Great price though.
