It exactly like the picture on Amazon.


It's a bit tight but very cute for the price


Wore it to class reunion. It looks good but if I had bigger boobs it would have been perfect.


this was surprisingly nice the material very think and heavy. I got lovely comments about how nice I looked


Such a lovely dress. I can't wait to wear it in Vegas!


I am 5'1 and 110 lbs... should have ordered the small :)


Fit well love always like this style we'll get several colors


Loved this dress! Bought for a New Yearâ€™s Eve party and it worked out wonderfully. The material is nice even if itâ€™s a little heavy. The quality of my dress was great (weird that there were no labels). I am 5â€™5â€� and 160lbs and the large worked well.


I'm a medium/large, ordered the large. It fit great. I'm 5'2 and it was pretty short on me. I wore some sexy fishnets underneath to feel comfortable. Cute dress for the price.


Love this dress! Ordered it for my friends' wedding and ordering another one for another wedding in the fall. I order the XL and it fit great!
