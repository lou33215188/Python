So pretty, covers larger mid section nicely!


Came stained. Small stain but it grossed me out to wear I haven't even worn it.


LOVED everything about this dress!! Very beautiful, comfortable, and great fit!!


My wife liked it but the front is too short, if you are a tall woman, the front is very short.


Very nice dress, thick fabric and fits perfect. Purchased for 8th grade graduation.


Loved the style. Hated the material. Felt super cheap and was way too heavy.


True to size, true to picture, soft breathable fabric easy to put on.


The dress was really cute, but the "high" in the front was a bit too short


Not really appropriate for formal events. The fabric feels cheap.


The material was really cheep and I received it with two holes I had to sew it up together....
