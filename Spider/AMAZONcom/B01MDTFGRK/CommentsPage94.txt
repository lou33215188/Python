Poor quality


I bought this for my sister to go to a school dance but it does run a size smaller than what you think you need so I would recommend going up one size


love it


the black is dull.


It’s so worth it for the price I bought it for my daughter who is 5’3” and the small fit her pretty well but it’s a little baggy but that means it would be comfortable


this is so cute! it was a little small for me but otherwise no complaints!


CHEAP


Comfortable but shorter in the front than I was expecting.


Fit my sister in law nicely


For someone 5’2” it is a bit short in the front & it was a little snug in the bust area..
