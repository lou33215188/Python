The quality is not what I expected and the dress runs extremely small.


Love it! I first ordered a medium because I read a review with close to same measurements as me. Yea that was a big mistake. It was to tight I'm my bust area. So I ordered an xl and fits perfect.


160, 38c, 42 waist


It covers love handles.


Don't buy!


Larger than expected. Heavy material


This dress was not for me. It is made of thick polyester/spandex fabric, much like a dance or skating costume. Very basic. Put together ok, but the dimensions were off. I am 5'7, 125lbs and the small was the correct size, but the waist was way too high on me. The shoulders weren't cut to lay like the photo. The color is much less deep than the one on the photo - I would describe is as grape BubbleYum. **There was also a tag offering free products for reviews.** Please keep that in mind when reading reviews for this product. I gave it two stars because the return with Prime was easy.


BEAUTIFUL MATERIAL ğŸ˜� Yes the material was heavy enough for a quick ride to the club and I got great compliment on it to. Color was exactly like the picture.


I am somewhat disappointed with the color it's more pink than rosy plus there is no tag inside the clothing, who makes a dress without tagging it with designer name and care information? I ordered a small but have not yet tried it, too disappointed with the presentation.


This is so cute and elegant looking. I love it and can't wait to wear it out on date night. The stitching is perfect and the material is thick enough that if you have a little belly, you won't even be able to tell. The part that flares out from the waist is just above my belly button so even if your not a curvy girl .... you can't eeeeeven tell ğŸ˜�lol


Ordered this awhile back, and while I don't love it, the hate I had upon first purchasing it has dimmed some, so I came to change my review but more importantly, I wanted to give kudos to the seller -- I asked to return it and based of where they were located and how it would be to ship it, they cut me a deal; keep the dress even though it was a little big and I didn't absolutely love it, and in exchange, they'd still give me a partial refund.  I think they were in Asia, and so I know how expensive customs shipping and all that can get, and so needless to say I was very impressed when I realized I forgot to purchase "Prime Free Returns" clothing and still they did what they could to ensure I got at least that partial refund.  This dress was not too terribly expensive to begin with, so I figured what the heck, it's less gas for me to have to ship it back.  Now that it's been a few months, I still haven't worn this dress outside of the house, but it IS great for something loose and lightweight but still warm instead of sitting around the house naked when there is too much pain in my arms to do up buttons and zippers and what not, so all in all, happy with the purchase although not using it how it was originally intended.


PS the color, at least on my screen, was very true to color.


Seriously I love this dress I bought a Large, normally wear a 12-14 but carry most of my weight in the hips (Chest is a 36C). It fit perfect in the chest and just a little loose in the stomach making it comfortable and not too tight. A high belt will solve any concerns about the fit so no problems there as I planned on wearing one with it anyway to accentuate my curves.


The material is soooooo soft! I plan on buying this dress in EVERY color. I bought the Yellow and it is so vibrant!


Honestly the only reason this isn't a solid 5 is after I started writing this review I noticed in the photo that it's SUPPOSED to fit off the shoulder however it doesn't appear that it's really cut for that. It appears to be more of a boat neck style than off the shoulder. Maybe going up a size would have solved that....but then it would be way to big in the tummy. Still happy with it either way!
