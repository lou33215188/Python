This was the perfect wedding guest dress, for a beach wedding! IT was awesom


I love the dress in general but it's somewhat large and with any necklace the dress unthreads itself


Absolutely love this dress, It fits beautifully and is very flattering.  I'm 5' 7" and weigh about 157, I decided on a large.  The quality of the fabric is great, good dress for the price.  I may buy again in red.  Wearing this for a night out, going to the Theatre to watch a play, but this dress could be for dancing, for a wedding, clubbing it, whatever.  Its simple but perfect.


Too nig


I love this dress! I was worried about buying a dress online but man this was perfect!!!


was a bit big but it was still perfect...


Love the dress. Would have been a five but it came with a rip.


Beautiful dress, good material, very chic


Love love love this dress!! It fit so well and I looked fantastic!


Very pretty.  I wish the sizing was a little better.
