My daughter loves it and looks great in it.


Color looks washed out. Quality doesn't look as good as the picture.


Terrible material. â€œShow choir dressâ€� material. Looks way too cheap.


The dress is nice. But it is too tight on the shoulders. Had to return it.


I really liked the material it was an awesome dress to have for my senior photos, it fit well I sized up it was a little shorter in the front then I was expecting but a nice dress for a solid amount. What the picture shows is what you get. ğŸ˜Š


Love love love! Very comfortable and cute even for plus size


The dress is beautiful but it was too big. Luckily the intended recipient of this has a younger sister that fits into it well.


This a the first time i order a dress online for it to fit exactly as I expected I love it so much and I'm going to order 2 or 3 different color .


Poor quality spandex like material, not as nice as the photo. Scrunched stitch in the shoulders. Awkward fit.


Nice dress
