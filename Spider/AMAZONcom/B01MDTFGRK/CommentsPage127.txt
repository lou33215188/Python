Cheaply made. The zipper was busted and I haven't worn it yet. This dress is cuter in the picture.


Very nice dress. Look just like picture.


Proportions are way off - the skirt is way too short in the front and the top of the dress is poorly fitted.


Great purchase ğŸ˜�


Fit ok. Wasn't anything super special but I did like the cut


Well suit it's purpose, quality as good as to be excepted for the price. Fits well good buy.


Disappointed ''"'"


Iâ€™m only 5â€™7â€� and this dress is indecently short in the front.


True to the advertisement, it looks as expected, fits well and has a clean finish.


Beautiful well made dress!!
