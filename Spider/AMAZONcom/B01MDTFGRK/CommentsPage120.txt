Fit perfectly


The dress fits perfectly. The color is a vibrant hue the fabric is soft breathable and flexible without losing its shape


This dress far exceeded my expectation! So pleased I purchased another color to add to my collection!


Dress arrived in time. But had a large hole in the main seam of the bodice. Very disappointed in quality control of this.


love  it looked great on my daughter


its simple but gorgeous! the price was remarkable for this item!


It fits very well. I am 5ft tall and I am normally a size 4/6 and I bought a medium. It looks great!


Size was right but the dress is very thin. Not sure how I can wear even a sticky bra. It will show through the material.


The dress does not look as elegant as it does in the picture. The saying,"You get what you pay for," definitely applies.


I like  material and the way it feels
