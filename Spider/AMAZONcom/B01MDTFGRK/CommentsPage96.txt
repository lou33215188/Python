Sizing incorrect. Runs small. Shiny silky ugly fabric.


Loved this dress! The material wasn’t cheap and fit very well. I was torn if I should order a medium or large. I ordered a medium and it fit perfect. I’m 5’5 170 lbs. I would def recommend.


Love this dress! It’s decent quality for what you pay and the bright yellow is stunning. Just had to steam it. Looks fantastic with my black belt and high black wedges


love the feel of it!


Really like the dress.  I ordered an XL and it is a little big, but the length is good, I think it would have been too short if I would have gotten a smaller size and I am only 5'6", but 175 lbs.


Thank you:-)


But it for my wife for valentine's day.  she gorgeous and sexy.  Love it!!!


Good


mid waist to small, the pleat in mid section cuts into belly making it look deformed


The sizes are not accurate. The material is cheap and the stitching is gathered in places.
