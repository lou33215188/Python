Fits perfect


It really looks nothing like the picture (aside from the color).


I returned it right after trying it on. :/


I'm 5'2" and barely 100 lbs, I thought with the high/low this dress would be one that wouldn't make me look shorter, but with the way it fit, it ended up making me look shorter AND fatter.


I really wouldn't recommend it if you're shorter.


Really beautiful dress. Loved it.


Love it


This material is not what is described...looks cheapğŸ˜¢


The dress fits perfectly


She loves it, thanks so much


Love this dress!!!!!


Way too short on me but I'm also 6'1....otherwise, very cute!
