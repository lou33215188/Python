Nice cut! Terrible fabric. Feels and smells like plastic.


It's really pretty! The front of the dress is a little shorter than expected but otherwise it's great for the price! Nice material as well not see through or cheap!


It fits perfectly, feels very comfy and looks absolutely lovely. I am very happy with this purchase


I love this dress! It fits well, and there is a touch of stretch to the material. The side zipper is a little hard to zip the whole way, but it works. Very pleased with my purchase -- I'm considering buying the dress in another color!


The picture shows a dress that you would see and the material looks smaller than what it is. So the size i got is a little larger than what i believed i needed.


I'm 5'9" and 120 lbs and I got a small.  It fit perfectly and looked exactly like in the picture.


If i could go zero i would! Dress was ripped at the zipper seam, had deodorant stains under arms and was a travesty.


Nice


More of an orange color not deep red like I had hoped


Beautiful dress. Hugs all the right places and is super comfy and classy
