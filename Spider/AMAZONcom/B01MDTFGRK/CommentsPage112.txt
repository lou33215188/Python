beautiful dress, stretchy and clingy material.  Shorter than I was expecting


Loved this dress it was absolutely stunning. I would recommend this dress. Perfect for a date, wedding or pictures!


It fit everywhere except for the part where the arms were supposed to be off the shoulders straight across the chest. I LOVED the dress other than that part.


I liked the fit, though it was a little loose on the top but I'm a 34b. The main problem was the color. The white is see-through.


Perfect dress for a wedding I went to. Everyone loved it!


Completely different to what I order ...I ordered a small and it fit me and Iâ€™m an extra large..quality is horrible..


Great casual looking dress


Cute dress.


It's beautiful and it fits just right. This is my second dress like this anf I'll probably buy it in another color.


The dress is a pretty tight fit but is made from nice, sturdy fabric. My biggest complaint is how short the front is. Some parts could definitely be revealed without much effort!
