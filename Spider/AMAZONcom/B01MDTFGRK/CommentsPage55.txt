great fit


Absolutely love! It fits like a glove and is very flattering


Luckily I order a larger size. The color is very pretty. 13 year old loves it.


The front was a little too short for me. Also didn't like the way the shoulders only had elastic in it.


know better will order large


Poorly made , seams buckled abd bunched up


Cute, but fits somewhat large! I had to get it altered around the waist. I ordered a size Small and am 5'1", 105 pounds.


All was Ok.


Totally wasted my money. The front of this dress is way too short. I have never been so disappointed in a buy. Thought i would be able to wear this dress for church but if i do my pastor will just send me out for all my legs will be showing. Very Disappointed
