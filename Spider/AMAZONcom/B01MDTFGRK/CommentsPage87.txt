I tried it on and the first thing that happen was that the zipper opened up, it still goes down but will suddenly open up again.


Just okay, never will buy clothes off of this site again.


Ordered the bright red and the color i received was like an orange/red. It looked more orange. Nothing close to what is pictured. Canâ€™t even wear it for the event I needed it for.


I dont normally wear dresses, but this is such a nice dress. Fits well, fabric is soft,i love it.


I absolutely love this dress,  i thought it was going to be big or probably small but it fits perfect and exact.....great job with this dress


My dress arrived with a big black stain. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money!


Love it


I absolutely love it


Fits perfectly but once it was tried on it just didn't look right on me. Beautiful color but just had to return,


Material like a swimsuit
