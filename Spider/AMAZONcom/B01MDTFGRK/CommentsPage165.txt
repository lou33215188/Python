Fits just right !


They refused to act normal for the photos. Ordered all sizes for my cousin. My friend and my cousin didn't really like them, because they were not sexy enough. Those 2, are used to wearing sexier clothing.  I told my cousin (black curly hair in blue), that because she's going to her boyfriend's siste's wedding, that it's best to wear size medium in this type of dress, because his parents will be there. So anyone that wants a dress for a wedding, I think this is perfect. We will return the other dresses and only keep the medium and maybe small. The size small, is very form fitting, and may be nice for an evening out to dinner, but not for wedding.
