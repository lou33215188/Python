Love it!! Bought a Large and it fit very well. The reviews helped and measurements were accurate.


Beautiful dress!


nice color, poor quality material. Had to return.


Hated the material!


Great product for the price.  Thick material and quite heavy.  I received lots of compliments at the wedding I wore it to.


It fits great! I chose a SMALL. It's the exact color- burgundy. The material is thin but soft. Great for any occasion :)


Didn't really like the material. The top part fits but not like what the picture shows. The dress was a bit too long and I am 5'7"


The red is definitely a BRIGHT RED and looks a lot better in the picture than in person. The fabric doesn't "fall off the shoulder" as expected, and is actually tightly banded past the shoulders. The fabric and fit is good but the design is poor.


This dress is really cute and the size was perfect.  I bought it for my 16 year old and she loves it.  The dress has stretch so it leaves room for different body types


The dress fit just perfect and I liked the clothing material wasn't see through. Flows very nicely. I want to but this in another color now. Great for formal events or business casual.
