I am shook right now. I needed a dress last minute and prime was the quickest way to get one to me. Not just anyone but an elegant CHEAP dress. I'm 209 pounds, size 14 pant and l/xl too. I got the 2x and wowowowow. I'm just shocked. Beautiful. Perfect fit. Looks amazing with my body type. Fabric feels wonderful. For this price, totally worth it


Too big for me I order large bcoz I wear medium and large so I decided to got large but too big for me specially on the shoulder it's a nice dress I love it just not fit


Love this dress.... wore it for bachlorette party.  Came quickly.  Fit as expected by reading what others wrote.


Teen age daughter wore to semi casual dress 16th Birthday Party of friend, she had many compliments on its color and design.


Good quality and super comfy. I got a large in green and yellow and it fits great! I wore it in Orlando as part of dressing for my day in the Wizarding World of  Harry Potter. The material was a little too warm for the weather, but it was in the 80s. Once the sun started to go down it was perfect!


Nice dress .Didn't fit though lol...


I'm size 14 ordered a xl. It is a stretchy material it fit a bit kind of lose. Beautiful dress non the less.


Despite the dress portions being hardly enough to fit my chest (I tried a small as a 36C since it fit everywhere else), it was super cute, gorgeous, and I'll probably buy a better size for the next event that I need one! I just don't wear dresses enough to keep a horde of them in my closet...


It’s perfect!!! I absolutely love it! Not to short and fits me in all the right places!!❤️ THIS DRESS IS A MUST!!


This dress is so gorgeous. I am a 8/10 normally, and I got the large. It fits perfect. The material is very nice, thick and good quality. Perfect for the wedding reception that I attended in the south summer weather. I plan on wearing this any time I have the need for a nice dress!
