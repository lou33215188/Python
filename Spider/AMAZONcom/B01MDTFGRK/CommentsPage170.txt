I love this dress. I'm 5'8 and weight is about 178lbs..I got it in a XL and it fits great.. I love how it cover my love handlesğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚.


Material is great, leaves room to move around in, stretchy.  I'm 5"3' ,130lbs and I got a small it fits perfectly.


This did not fit how it should have. I haven't had many problems with buying clothes online because I always look at the size charts, but this was too small.


I am actually returning this item as the quality is very poor. It doesn't seem to have a seam and while it's a nice design it is not something that fits right. There aren't any tags so if the bottom was not a high-low skirt I would never know which way the dress goes. Overall it's just a very cheap looking dress. Then again, it was very cheap.


This dress is so darling! It's very flattering & classy!


Sadly I'll be returning mine because it didn't fit and I need a different size!


I ordered the 2x and i thought it would barely fit but i was wrong! it fit me PERFECTLY. The sleeves do stretch and there is a small zipper on one side of the dress. I would completely buy this dress again. Great deal as well for the amazing quality of the dress.


It looks like a childs dress on.


Had to order one size up. Still pretty short in the front but very cute fit. Can't wait for my night out to get to wear it.


Modified the dress a bit -- I prefer a "shorter" dip in the back, but dress is a fashion staple.  Pretty color.


This is the worst dress I ever seen. It's nothing like the picture. The style did not even look close to the picture.. I cannot even emphasize how disappointed I am with this company that thinks it's ok to sell such garbage an (AMASON)you should be a shame of yourself.
