It fit as expected! I was a little nervous as I had read the comments but did exceptionally well as it fit. Did follow the chart but everyone size is different! I ordered a 2x because I weighed at the time 212lbs. The material was as expected and neatly wrapped in a bag!


I really do love this dress I wore it on the Christmas party..


Love the color. Blue just pops. It's so soft.


Some people were saying that it was short in the front. It fit me perfect but I don't have much for curves. My friend bought the same dress in yellow and she has curves and it was a little short up front. Just to where she'd wear some shorts underneath.


This dress is really beautiful  and comfortable. I love it!!! Excellent quality for the price.


I got this dress for my daughters 8th grade formal. Its super cute and the material is nice. Held up well to washing.


Bought it for my daughter. She is small, it was rather long on her.


I returned item, I have a lot of curves and short.  The dress didn't fit to my liking


The neckline of this dress is a stretchy elastic band. That may help it stay up, but it also looks really strange. The material was pretty thick which is nice, but I couldn't get over the odd neckline. It reminded me of the top of sweatpants. I returned it.


Cute, gets hella compliments but wrinkles easy
