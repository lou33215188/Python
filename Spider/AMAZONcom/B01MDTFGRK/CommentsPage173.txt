Very very cheap quality. The torso fits in a very lumpy way and it is not fitted well at all. It was frustrating to receive something with loose threads upon unwrapping.


It's wayyy too big for me.


My granddaughter loves it, so cute on her!


I got a large and it was a little to big but that could be just me. I teeter between medium and large.


Ordered xxl, yet I wear 12US


Poorly sewed together


I have not worn the dress and I tried it on when I got it. I'm 5'1 about 180lbs and purchased at L. I can't wait to wear it out for the holiday.


Very heavy


I wear a size 12-14 and wanted a skater fit because I'm 6 month post-csection. I ordered a size large dress fit perfectly However there were no tags on the dress and a small rip in the side seam.


Well made but not true to size..Too small.
