Beautiful I love it .


Love this dress!!! I got the bright blue, fit just right, good thick and forgiving material.  Got a LOT of compliments!  I will be buying it in way more colors.  One nice statement necklace and you're set. I'm short and curvy, 5'3", 190 lbs, and an XL worked.


Got it for my wife. She loves it!


I love this dress! it's so cute and in style and I can wear it to multiple events


love love love. can't say enough good things about this dress. it was my birthday dress and it was perfect


I bought the small and i'm 5'2 and 123lbs.


Fits and looks just as described! Worked great for my upcoming banquet and elegant looking. I ordered a medium and fit great.


It is an okay dress. Nothing amazing, I would rather just buy a dress at forever21. The material is not the best, but it does fit your body nicely.  I don't know, I am just not feeling it with this dress. Maybe it would look better with a belt, or some accessories.


Fits as expected


Absolutely loved it ... got an xl for a loose flowy fit .... donâ€™t hesitate to get it


Some of the seams are rather sloppy and the material is not the best quality. It has a glossy, synthetic look in person than didn't come across in pictures. Definitely feels more cheaply made than other, similarly priced, dresses I have previously purchased on Amazon. Not a terrible dress but there are better ones out there.
