I feel like I wasted my money. I ordered a small, it came really large with heavy material and does not fit like the photo.


I ordered the purple one. First off It came nothing like the picture and wayyyy too big. Secondly The top has this ugly elastic sewn into it , it does not fall off the shoulder like expected but sits on top of it. Wish I could give it zero stars, do not waste your money.


Fits well. Although the color is off.


Beautiful dress. Good quality. Fitted my daughter perfectly.  Itâ€™s exactly like the description


This dress looks so sexy on me you can would never know I love it


I'm usually a medium 6-8 in dresses. I was lucky this got around my neck! I think maybe an XL or XXL may have been just about right bc it runs ridiculously small and not to mention short! I'm 5'0 and the medium would show off my hoohah!


Other than that, the material is great for the price, the dress is accurate. The sizing is just off.


Beautiful. True fit to size. I bought this dress for a wedding & received plenty compliments. Thanks


Its a decent dress looks cute enough and comfortable very casual looking dress. Material is thick but i wore it in the summer heat and was fine. Im 5ft,  125-130lbs and very busty 34DD ordered M and it was too big. So i would say it runs big


Scored major brownie points with the by surprising her with this dress. Her one comment on it is that if you are busty and have broad shoulders the off shoulder makes wired things happen near your armpits but you can wear it pulled over the shoulders and it looks just fine


This dress is the bomb dot com. It fits like it was custom made for my body. Im 5'5 and 160 lbs, the large fits perfectly.
