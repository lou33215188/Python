Loooove this dress! Very flattering and the sleeves don’t slide up! I am going to buy it in all the colors!


It's a little to big, but it's what I ordered.. I love the way it falls and for the price you can't beat that...


It's much longer than you'd think and the fit is super weird. I wouldn't recommend this.


I looked great in it.


It’s ok


I don't like the fabric well. Look cheap.


Nice fit. Thick material. Good length


Material is nice and worked for what I needed.


Nice material


Not too happy with this dress, was too big. I am returning.
