It was ok needs jewellery to make it look great.


Very pretty, I bought the black and it definitely looks slimming. Very happy with the purchase. 150 lbs, 5'2" and M fit perfectly.


stupid short in the front!


Beautiful dress.


Wore this at a wedding and got quite a few compliments! With it being polyester it has quite a bit of stretch but fits great and hits everywhere just right. I'm 5'1 and it was the perfect length


The dress is super cute but it doesn't exactly fall and fit where I need it. I guess I'm in between sizes.  I purchaeed the blue but it is not the exact shade of blue shown in the photo. It is not as bright. It appears to be a few shades lighter. The material is ok for the price. I dress it up with shiny silver earrings and shoes. It really made the ensemble sparkle.  I would recommend this dress to a friend.


Oh my!! 20 bucks and looks like a million!


I canâ€™t believe this. The fit is perfect and it looks just like the picture.


Bought it as a gift and she loves it! Fits perfectly and looks great


Very cute for the price.  A slinky soft material but the color is rich.  I got it in rosw


Good quality, but very see through
