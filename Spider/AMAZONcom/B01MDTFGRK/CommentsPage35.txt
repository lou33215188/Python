The dress does not fit or look nothing like the pic. Thank God I purchased a second options. However, I feel I should mention the dress is not ugly it just wasn't the cocktail style I was looking for..


It's not as heavy as I expected, but it's still pretty good quality material. I also thought it would be a little bit darker that it actually is. But It's comfortable and classy, depending on the occasion.


Super duper cute! Sexy plus size dress for a sexy old (wanna be young) lady!


I got this for my daughter for a party. It is a beautiful and elegant dress


ITS GORGEOUS. The matierial is soft and light. I'd wear some spandex under the dress cuz when you twirl it looks great but it goes up pretty high.


I got a size larger than I normally wear because I saw others posting that it fit small. It was still tighter than expected. I still love it, though.


I like the dress, the color is exactly as pictured, but it fits tighter than I expected. I'm 5'-6", 150lbs and got a size L.


The fabric is pretty thick and hides imperfections ;) However, the hem/trim on the neck looks sloppy and unfinished. It looks like it was made with a home sewing machine.


Very poor quality. And was torn and stained before I even opened the package. Iâ€™m very disappointed.


Way too big, does not even make sense how oversized it was. Ordered a medium so I could have made a large work but there was just nothing I could to make it look good.


Order one to 2 sizes bigger. I usually wear a 2x, ordered a 2x and it was a little short in the front and snug. My cousin also ordered one and she wears a xl and ordered an xl and was too tight. Not flattering for larger figures.
