Loved it.  Loved it so much wanted to take on my first cruise.. Couldn't fine it after my work Christmas party, so I ordered another one.


I ordered this dress and returned it immediately. I'm 5'1 - 110 pounds. The dress is very poor quality, loose extra material that wasn't cut properly, weird material and didn't fit my body well.


I ordered this dress last minute for my engagement pictures. It arrived right on time and I received so many compliments. It fit perfectly. I do not have any complaints! I LOVE this dress!


see through....


Love it, it is a little heavy but it's simple and nice.


This dress was very cute, it fit well and was very much like the picture.


This dress is beautiful and fits me very well.  Accentuate the middle with a nice bustier, and this dress becomes part of a gorgeous outfit.  10/10 would purchase from this company again.


I love this dress and it was true to size


Fit slightly large on the top half. Although never worried about it slipping down. Would always slip up my neck and not staying in the off the shoulder look


I used these for my brides maids dresses. Everyone looked beautiful
