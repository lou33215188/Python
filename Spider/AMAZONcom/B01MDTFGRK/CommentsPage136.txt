Very good quality for $20. dress. Heavy textile. Perfect for teenagers party.


Sturdy material. Great shape and very flattering


The dress was very pretty once we had it altered


material was very heavy and almost rough feeling. it is a pretty design but i really didnt think it was very comfortable to wear


Perfect


The material wasn't what we expected.  It doesn't lay neatly.


This fit so amazing on me I looked and felt beautiful in it.


looks cheap. smelled weird, and looks awful on


The quality of the dress was not great. It does not look like the picture.


No waistline. You look huge in it
