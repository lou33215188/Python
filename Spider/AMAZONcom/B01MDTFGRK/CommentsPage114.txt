Not great quality but only needed it for a photo shoot so it served its purpose


dress fit perfect!


I usually wear a size 20, and the XXL was too tight for me. The stitching is also not the best, but if the fit was on I probably could have gotten a few wears out of it.


Daughter tried on dress and it fits as expected. Loved the material and color of this dress.


Very comfortable, great value, love the color (got the red one).


Dress appeared to be made of cheap fabric and it was easy to tell where the elastic along the neckline was.


Horrible look. Both my sis and mine and we are 2 different sizes


The size was a different size group..


I love this dress! My favorite thing about it is that it can be worn casually or dressed up with some heels and accessories! Super comfy!


So adorable!! Would buy again!
