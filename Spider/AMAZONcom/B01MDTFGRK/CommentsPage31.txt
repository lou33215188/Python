Gorgeous dress and I have received so many compliments on it.  I wore the dress once and now the zipper is broken.  I loved this dress and originally gave it five stars but when I tried to wear it recently the zipper disappeared in the dress.


This dress has an awkward fit. It's really loose on the top. I got a size large ( I'm 5'9 165lbs 36c bust) it hangs terrible but the worst part is the front of the dress is really short.  It was only a couple inches past my upper thigh.  I had to return it


It doesn't flare out as pictured, but it's very pretty. The material is nice and it breathes. Unfortunately, my dress arrived with a tear near the zipper and I have to return it.


Great fit!! Looks good on! The fabric is thick and moves with you. It's very sexy, yet comfortable. I'm so glad I bought it. Now I'll look great for my friend's wedding.


not really as described - it seems you might have to wear a small petty coat underneath to make it puff out like in the image.


I love this!  I read a review that said the front wasn't shorter than the back...not so in my case.  I can't wait to wear this to my friends wedding.


Nice


Loved the dress but simply decided to exchange for the purple color for a school dance. Nice heavy material "very comfortable" rich color and true to size. Return was simple and fast. Reordered the same dress in purple ... arrived well packaged both times and as promised.


Great material. Fit like a glove. I was very happy with this purchase! I followed the measurement scale and it was a great fit.


Sizes run big so if you are usually a large and want a tight fit I would go with a medium. I ordered a large and the dress looks somewhat baggy on me.
