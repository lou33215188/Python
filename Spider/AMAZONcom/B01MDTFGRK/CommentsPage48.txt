Lovely dress, has all the right features, nice draping and great fit, loved it, they should have it on other colors, defiinately a great buy, the hi-low feature looks great.


Didn't really like the feel of the material,  but it fit and looked good on


I am about 5'4" and 140lbs. I ordered a medium and it is a little big. Other than that, the material is super soft and it looks beautiful. I think it will be perfect for Thanksgiving! (I won't mind the extra room then!)


This is the best dress I’ve ever bought for $16. It exceeded my expectations and I got a lot of compliments on it. People were surprised that I got it on Amazon. I took one star off because it has an odd zipper under one armpit that doesn’t really serve a purpose.


Kinda looks cheaper than it cost but still looks good.


This dress is very nice, I wear it often even for non-formal days.I am 5'11, around 200 lbs, got a xl and fits perfectly on me. I would recommend. (considering getting another in a different color actually.)


Personally, I love this dress. Although it's very simple its easy to accessorize it up! The front is a little bit shorter than I expected but it's still very nice. The material is soft considering. Would would recommend.


The fit may run small but that is what she required, so we are happy. Very pretty.


I wore this dress to a friends wedding and I received multiple compliments. I'm 5'9 at about 170 lbs and wearing spanx to find everything lol. I would definitely buy this again.. in black. Material is stretchy too. Not a bad dress for the price either!


I bought this for a holiday party and plan on wearing it for NYE and my birthday.  The sleeves dont stay as off the sholders like in the picture, but i made it work.
