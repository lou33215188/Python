I love this dress. I bought it for a family event and everyone complimented on it all night. I should have gone. Size up since I Have been blessed on top. I would recommend to anyone to go ahead and get one.


This dress looks better on than it does in the picture. Fits exactly as described. Love it!!


Awesome luv the dress


Fits fantastically and is made out of decent material. Don't expect to be able to reach anything past your shoulders though, the dress doesn't take to that kind of movement.


I bought this in the purple color, very flattering. A little stretchy. Just wish it was a little longer on the front because it kept riding up. I'm 5,2 and about 160lbs and I bought a size large.


Fits great, I loved it I wore it for my graduation and complains were given. I love it


This dress doesnâ€™t fit right. It hangs weird when put on.


Perfect for the party.


I love this dress even with a lil tummy...I'm 5'3" and 230 XL fit great...stretches too


Bought the dress for my daughter's neon themed Homecoming dance. The dress in person doesn't look semi formal at all and it is more of a mustard color rather than neon yellow.
