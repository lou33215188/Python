good dress


It's so cute!  Love the fit!  I haven't gotten  to wear it out yet, but I tried it on and am very pleased. My only complaint is that the colour isn't as vibrant as I thought (was hoping) it would be.


Love it beautiful dress!!!!


I absolutely love this dress! The fabric is thick and stretchy and fits perfectly! I was worried the color would be a little too pink like some of the pictures, but its a beautiful deep burgundy. Totally worth it.


Bought for my girlfriend. The material isn't very breathable and fits a bit snug. It's cute, but isn't comfortable to wear.


Good material, but it feels like there is too much material. very flowy.Â 


Not a great fit


I bought this for my wife for family pictures and she loved it, she later got compliments in this dress at the grocery store and had everyone in our grocery store in a daze!


Cute for the price.


Super comfy and perfect fit!
