I bought this dress for my baby girl it looks amazing. The color I choose is red Christmas brunch she will be the talk of it all


I like the way it looks from thw waistdown butfdom the waistup its a bit too snug. Its really nice but not the best if you're very busty


vivid color.. - fits - but a little snug for my (personal) liking..  i am 5' 5" and 174 -


Most beautiful dress so got 3 colors


Fits well but the material is see-through


It nice but way to big,Can I change size?


I ordered an XL but received a 2X. It was too big and I hate the material..Its like the church choir robe material..too thick.  Returning it ASAP


Dress is super cute I ordered a medium and a large just in case, I am usually a medium, both were too big.


Didn't like the material. Doesn't look like the picture.


the waistline was a bit smaller than expected but overall it was a nice dress
