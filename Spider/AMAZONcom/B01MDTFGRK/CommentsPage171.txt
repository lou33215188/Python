color not what the picture looks like. definitely not a plumb or deep purple color. had to return. cute dress otherwise


Love, love, love it! I want it in every color! You can dress it up or down, it's perfect! I received so many compliments while wearing it!


Perfect dress! I used it for a debutante ball that I was invited to. It was the perfect length and had enough support.


Fabric was good material and it was comfortable. But be careful with the zipper, I thought since the material is pretty stretchy I could just slip it on over my head, worked the first time but the second time the zipper popped when I tried to pull it over my chest(I'm a 36c and ordered a medium) I was able to fix the zipper somehow though. Make sure to unzip before putting it on! :)


This dress just wasn't my style. I think it looks great on others but for me it didn't feel right.


Wasn't to happy


The dress it self is nice thick material , but if you are plus size like myself you want to maybe get a size or two bigger than your size it was very snug but I still enjoyed it .


The material is very good; thick and smooth. The design is very simple and cute. I got a size small and i have a petite average size body (5', 115 pounds with a bra size of 34b). And the off the shoulder design falls at a very conservative level.


Size not comparable to my wife's dresses listed same.


You look cheap. I don't know, maybe because the material or the style in the back.
