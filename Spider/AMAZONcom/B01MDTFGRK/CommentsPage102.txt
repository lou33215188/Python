Love this dress!


Good quality, cute, and comfortable!


Wouldn't buy again.


I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It is made from a heavy fabric that flows nicely. I ordered according to the size chart and it was a perfect fit.


I'm pretty busty so the dress was too fitted for a small the rest fit well. Very good thick material. I wouldn't say the color is this bright but very yellow yes ğŸ˜Š


honestly one of my favorite dresses ever. it's super comfortable, and looks/feels great. the cut and color in the photo are very accurate. i definitely recommend it!


Looks much better on the model. Not happy with it. Back is really long


I like the way it fits nd the way it feels  of the dress.


What I didn't expect is for the color to be different from pic.


fabric stinks...trying to get the smell washed out


Bought this for a friend and she LOVED it
