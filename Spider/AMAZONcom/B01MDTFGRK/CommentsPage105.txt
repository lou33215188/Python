Little challening to get rid of the wrinkles, but overall fit well and looks great at a great price!


The dress was ok. I returned it because the collar looked bad


The quality is really bad . I knew that the price is not expensive so the product will be kinda cheap . But it’s looks very cheap. Desapoint


This dress is SO CUTE! Great material and beautiful fit. I'm 5 FT tall and was worried about length. Size small fits me perfectly.


Just not a good fit


Home made hand sewn. Looked terrible. Heavy material, no class. Never order again


Love the fit and material. The color is perfect


Only problem I had with the dress is that it didn't fit off the shoulders like in the picture. It fit more like a wide scoop neck sweater.


I’m really upset,  I receive the dress today and the zipper is ripped out...


I love the way this dress looks on me.  Am 5’ 3, 135 pounds got the small.  Perfect.
