great fit and nice material


Awesome


Looks just like the pictures - good color. Material has weight to it.


It was okay I guess, but fit loose in torso and wasn’t very flattering. I returned it.


I am 5' 11'' and am normally a LG/XL.  I ordered the dress in XL and XXL and both were too small and too short. It'd be cute on a petite woman. :o)


She loved the dress! Perfect for the wedding we went too. Bought an XL


Very cute and comfy. Can be worn off shoulder or on!


fabulous! fits perfect and the price is unbelievable.


Very cute, but the smallest size is definitely too big for me. I’m 5’4 and weigh 115lbs and it’s baggy around my torso. It’s also very difficult to get the wrinkles out of!


Flattering, confortable, can be casual or dressier. Love it.!
