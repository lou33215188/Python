I am 130lbs ordered a medium and it fits perfect! Lovely dress! I will buy in another color


The dress is good quality for the price. However the top part is kind of large and goes up and the bottom was longer than expected.


The dress is really pretty, I love the cut and it's very comfortable. I would recommend ordering one size up though. I'm normally a 12-14 in dresses and the Large was super tight on me.


I liked the shoulder look but the fabric was not what it said it was going to be its spandex it falls off at anysize.


Quality of material used makes the dress look cheap


I ordered it a bigger because iâ€™m wary of the fit around the bust but I could have gotten a smaller size. I love the color.


Exactly what I wanted for my New Years Party ya work. Classy and not too showy. Looks great with my Napa LipSense lipstick!


Great dress. Fabric is very nice and fit beautifully.


Nice color and fit well.


I love this dress it fits exactly as I thought it would I ordered a xl just in case I'm normally between a size 10-14 depending on the style of dress
