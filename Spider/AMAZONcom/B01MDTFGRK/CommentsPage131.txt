Hated it!!!!!! The design and color of the dress is very deceiving...doesn't look anything like the picture


You have to be careful buying clothes from China, they dont have a clue what size is what.


Upon close inspection I found that thread was missing in about 4 places around the neckline and the elastic was exposed.  I will be returning the dress.


Didn't like the material wasn't as expected


everyone loved this dress!


the material is thick but it fits perfectly


Material was cheap and dress did not look as pictured. Definitely not a dress for formal events.


The dress is a lot shorter in the front than expected. The material was a lot heavier than expected, too warm for this type of year.


Awesome dress for the price. Fit perfectly and nice material.


Very nice fit and decent fabric.
