good quality material is nice and thick


The dress was a hit at the party. Everyone adored it and the high low design. It fit like a glove. I ordered a large. I recommend ordering the dress. You can't beat the price.


lovely colour and the off shoulder stays on. Great material. Flirty yet classy. Good wardrobe addition .


Low quality, awkward fit, runs large.


A little disappointed that it is too large for me to wear, despite the sizing chart saying otherwise. But the color is incredible, and it seems to be well made. I'd recommend it- just sad I can't wear it.


I get compliments every time I wear it And it's so comfortable!


Excellent Product. Took a while to arrive tho


Itâ€™s just ok i should have ordered a smaller size but the dress cute


Looks crappy...material is crappy..... I hate it. Will try to make it work.


I love this dress. It's not to thick and not too thin. I love the hi-lo style so I don't have to be self-conscious of it riding up in the back. It is really flattering.
