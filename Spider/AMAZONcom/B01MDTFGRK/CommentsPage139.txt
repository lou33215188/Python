I bought this for a semi formal. Its so so pretty. A little heavy and not very stretchy but very fitting ğŸ˜�


It's short. And the top part is big


I got a small it's it's more a M/L and I'm upset that it doesn't fit


Loved it!  Fit perfectly. Very comfortable.  Ended up buying two more in different colors


This is the worst material that I have ever bought from Amazon. Please dont waste your money or time.


Love it. Fits perfectly.


This dress does not look the same the picture.  The picture is prettier.  The dress runs big.


It's very cute and more then what I was expecting. Love it


i got a medium. im 5â€™5 and 157 lbs. it fits great.


I am SO in love with this dress.  Zero complaints.
