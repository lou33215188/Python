This dress feels great and fits perfectly. The material is spandex like but not cheap looking at all!!!! I was extremely satisfied with my purchase .


That picture was taken off of Windsor, you can go on there and get it for 36$ with better quality.


Very cute, but the seam at the waist was a little high on my.  I wish it hit me at my natural waist.


I'm pretty sure Betty from Riverdale wore this dress in lavendar.


it does not fit very tight


Shoulder straps don't fit down off shoulder. Plus the dress itself is a bit small


simple and elegant. could be dressed up or down! very versatile. I love it


Too short in front


As pictured. Good buy for the money.
