Super cute and comfy dress. I’m about 160 with 36 DD, usually wear a size 10 in pants and M/L in tops and it was a bit loose on me. I got a L, but I probably could have gotten a M.


It's a very pretty dress...color is just as wanted... Got a Large, little bigger in sides and chest... a little alternating made it perfect... Wonderful for the price.


beautiful dress! It was perfect for a holiday party. had to readjust to my shoulders a few times but other than that, it was a classy and  successful party dress!


Very pretty dress only let down was I ordered the green one and I  was expecting the dress to be an emerald and it was less intense. I still like it but I was expecting it to be like the picture and it seems more faded to me.


The material of this dress is really nice and stretchy. Iam 5' 7 and the length is perfect comes right above the knee. However I did buy an XL and it is a little snug on the top. Iam a bigger chested woman.


Love this dress!


Product comes from China. Dress length is a tiny longer than what I like (I'm 5.0') but its still okay. The off- shoulder straps slide up, constantly had to pull them down. Loved the color, material not so much. Fast shipping.


Love how thick and good quality the material is for the price. I’m 5’7” 145lbs so I ordered a medium. It seems to fit a little snug, but overall very satisfied with this dress.


Excellent purchase. Great fit, sturdy material.


Great material and beautiful cut. Definitely very fitted.
