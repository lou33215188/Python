Love this dress, fit perfect, and shipping was fast.


Was very large buy a size down!


This dress is made with great material! It fits perfectly with my height. I'm 5"4, 220 lbd


Horrible material and fit.  I was so disappointed that I returned it as soon as I got it!


Didn't like the material


Loose on waist area


My niece loved it. Great dress, made well, fun to wear.


No complain of evrything


I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A SIZE SMALLER. I BOUT A LARGE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A MEDIUM...5'5 AND 169LBS


poor fabric... not sophisticated at all; after all the value matches the product.
