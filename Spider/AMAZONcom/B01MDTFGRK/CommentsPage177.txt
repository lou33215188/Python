Absolutely love it


It's a gross dress


excellent


This dress would be a nightmare to wear out! My arms felt like they were going to fall off because of how tight these "off the shoulder" sleeves. I can't believe they get away with calling them that because they really didn't even go that far without some effort. The zipper is under the armpit witch didn't really provide much help with removing the dress. The seam work is just awkward, especially around the collar. It shows everything under the dress, so plan on no underwear and a sticker bra.


I am so disappointed with this dress. The blue is so dull, nothing like what is shown on the model. The stitching in the shoulder area is tacky. I bought this for my photoshoot but I'll definitely have to find a new outfit as it doesn't even fit as envisioned. Ugh!!


the style ended up being weird...


Very cheaply made.  Maybe for a teenager but not a grown woman that wants quality.


Way too big for size small


Didn't like it. Especially the material. I wear extra large but got 2X just in case due reviews still too tight.


The worst !
