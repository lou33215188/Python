My wife loves this dress. It fits perfectly and it's very flattering to women with large hips and big butts.


I got so many compliments when I wore this


I was so excited about this item based on the reviews, however, my dress was not at all what was pictured or discribed. It came woth a musty smell, the zipper was broken, and the dress was not sewn properly. Very disappointed.


It wasn't flattering on my body type so I returned it.


IT fits well but the material is not what it looked like in the add but it works


Thank you


fits, arrived in a timely manner, no complaints


I would give this zero stars if I could. The dress that was sent was a completely different dress than in the photos online (see attached). An incredible inconvenience, and was hoping to wear to a specific event. Very disappointed in this!


The front curved up too much, making it really short in front.  Would have been awesome otherwise!


Not for those who are over size 14
