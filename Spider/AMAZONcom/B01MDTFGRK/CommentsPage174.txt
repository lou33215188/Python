Im wearing this for my wedding!!!!


For a man trying out women's clothing for the first time, it's ok, because it makes me look pregnant which is a plus. ....


Really cute! Got for a Bachelorette party!


Cute dress but if you have big boobs forget it.


I bought this dress for a wedding but I still enjoy wearing it. The sleeves are a little snug but it is because I workout twice a week. Everything else about this dress was perfect.


I am very tall and the front was too short on me... even in the large.


not recommended for tall gals.


Runs small had to return it


nice


I ordered my size but it fits smaller. I would have to go up a size larger for it to fit


Very thick material which was not very flattering on the body. Very cute dress though.
