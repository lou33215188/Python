Fits true to size but too short in front. Unfortunately I had to return it. I'm 5'4, 180lbs and the XL fit perfectly with the exception of it being too short in the front.


Absolutely beautiful cut and material. I bought it for a wedding and it is just the cutest thing I absolutely adore it.


Love the dress, I was a bit scared that it wouldn't fit but it fit as expected it's true to size.


My grilfriend love it!


does not fit well and entirely too big.


Love this dress will update with pic when I wear it!


A little small.


Definitely needed two sizes bigger instead of one size larger.


It was a cute design, however, the dress looked very cheap when I received it and just looked trashy when I tried it on.
