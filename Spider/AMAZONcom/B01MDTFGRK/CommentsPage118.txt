This dress looks nothing like it , it's not an off the shoulder dress it sits on your shoulders , and it's a really heavy thick material


Love it


Was torn when I opened it, would like to return it


Fits great and is super cute. Material is kind of heavy and thick though, not like I expected.


Material is mainly polyester. Lower quality material. OK dress for the price.


Way too short in the front....


Wasn't even the right style


Wore it too a wedding, felt great!


Much shorter than I anticipated. Not very flattering.


Cheap material and very cheaply made. It also smells intensely like the plastic bag it came in. DO NOT BUY!!!!
