I saw this dress elsewhere for much, much more.  I took a chance and ordered it.  I'm 5'5", 148 lbs., a little thick in the middle, but this dress is AWESOME.  The gathering in front hides my belly and the stretch of the fabric emphasizes my good points...I don't think I've ever looked so good in any other dress!  Depending on the dress, I usually wear a size 10 or 12.  I ordered the 12, and love the way it fits!!  Very flattering, looks exactly as pictured. This was a marvelous find, thank you Amazon!!!


I was looking forward to have this dress... I wasnt even able to wear it because of that damn zipper, it teared appart in one second... so disappointed ... waste of my money :(


Shape is not at all as described. Return service and quality are both awful.


I didn't like it once I tried it on so I returned it


Too Small . Even ordered a size up.


Super cute a little smaller than dresses I typically buy like this.


Material was good but the measurements listed are incorrect. It was about 4 inches shorter in total length. Would be fine for someone 5'2"


The dress is nice for casual wear but not nearly dressy enough for the semi formal school dance we purchased it for. .  The darts in the bodice are  high and do not line up with my 15 year old daughters breasts at all - not even close.  If she pulls it down to line up with her breasts, the arm holes are too large and baggy.


Beautiful dress. Fit perfect


Great hat
