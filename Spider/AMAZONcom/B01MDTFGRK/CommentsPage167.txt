It's not really off the shoulders. It comfortably fits more like a boat neck, which is not what is pictured. When sitting at this comfortable level of boat neck, the front is very short at the bottom. If I try to pull the shoulders down to represent the photo, the material puckers and it is uncomfortable.


The material is also very heavy. I wish I didn't miss my window of opportunity to return it, because I would.


I would recommend this to no one.


Nice fabric, great fit. Love it


I think that is cute


It really like dress fit me  well .


Some what big.


Maybe I should have read more closely what "Skater dress" meant but I had assumed it meant the style not that it was actually for a skater. The material is extremely heavy and tight. The style was not flattering on me (5'9) and the sleeve cut off circulation to my armpits. The seems we're a little off so the skirt is slightly off center which personally bothers me a lot. It's a dress that will hang in my closet until I find someone who wants it.


I didn't want to give a 1 star because delivery was extremely prompt. Came in a plastic package inside other purchases from Amazon.


Totally returning when I print out what I need to. Doesn't look nothing like the photo and I dont like the material. If it was made like the photo I would have kept it.


Love itğŸ˜�


Love it


I am 6ft 160pds, 35 bust, 29 waist and 39 hips for reference. If you can't imagine, I am slender, and somehow a size medium in this dress made me looked like a stuffed turkey.
