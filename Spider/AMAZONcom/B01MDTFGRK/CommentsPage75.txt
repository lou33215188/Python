It was a really nice dress and fit well, though the way it fit was different than what's shown. The size was correct and fit well in that way, but the flare in the skirt happens higher than shown in the picture. Otherwise, it was a good dress.


It was worth the price.  Not top quality, but can definitely be upgraded with accessories and some heels!!!  Love the color though.


I love the dress. I got it for my friend's graduation and it looked amazing, it is so comfy too. I order the red one and I was a little bit scared to wash it but it doesn't leave any stains on my other clothes. The fabric is soft as well. I definitely recommend it for everyone.


Beautiful dress.  Bought the white one as well.


Nice material. Doesnâ€™t look cheap. Has a side zipper.


Lots of compliments from this dress, it's flattering and comfy.


It was too short for daughter I ordered it for so she gave to her sister other wise they loved it


I only used it once and the zipper stitch is starting to come undone


Great dress for my 30th birthday photo shoot! Very flattering and nice material. The only drawback was that the material wrinkles easily.
