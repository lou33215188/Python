Purchased as a gift. Fit as expected.


dont like the material


Picture seemed different...not bad but not what I expected


Love the fit it's perfect.


Color is exactly as shown. I wear a size 2 and it fit perfectly


The finishing of the dress is not good


Took on vacation to Jamaica. ..it was at the height of fashion ...lots of compliments


It's a little snug but over all a beautiful dress. Got a good deal of compliments on it already.


Does not look like the pic


Itâ€™s a beautiful inexpensive dress.
