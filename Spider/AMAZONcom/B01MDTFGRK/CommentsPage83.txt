Love the fit and material


Cute dress, but stitching already frayed.  Came out the package like that. Unable to wear it until I take it to a seamstress.


This dress was for a dance, and looked fine for one night. The neckline didn't fit like it should've and kept turning into more of a boatneck, but other than that the dress fit as expected. This is not a dress I would wear on a regular basis but it was fine for one event.


The material is like a swim suit so it feels like a swim suit dress. Not what I thought at all, scared to ever order a dress online again. I thought it was nice material I get it and it’s lkme pure spandex


Loved it. Fit good.. jad some good weight to it.


Loved the dress. I got a large. Unfortunately, it was a little small for me. But I was afraid of getting an XL and having it fit too big.


Very cute but I don't love the fabric and the high-low difference is much more dramatic than the picture. At least it seemed like it to me.


Fits as expected...it is a very straight dress. It’s not as flowy as the pictures show. Was a little disappointed because it is not near as dressy as I thought. But it’s alright.


I would say it fits as expected, but depending on your body shape, it can definitely be too big in some areas.


Great dress especially for the price. I'm 5'2" 145lbs and I ordered a size 6 and it fit perfectly. Shipped very quickly and I got it well before expected.
