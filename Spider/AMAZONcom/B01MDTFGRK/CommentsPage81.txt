Bought this for my daughter with the fear that it likely wouldn't fit or be made of thin material.  We were pleasantly surprised that it looks and fits great!  Nice product, good material and good price!


Just right fit


The dress fits everywhere nicely except the front length. I was going to wear this to a wedding, but it's too short in the front for a night of dancing. Unfortunately will not be wearing it to the event planned.


It’s cute. Fits as expected. I’m 5’5” 155 lbs pear shaped. I ordered a large. But I did end up returning because I have found one I like better. Good deal for the price.


I didnt like how close it was to my armpits.


Item fits well. I will recommend it


Perfect Thanks


This dress is extremely short in the front. The fabric is cheap looking. If your going to order i would suggest ordering up a size.


I ordered a medium, I still have a little of a postpartum body, I feel it is very flattering for me.


This was a beautiful dress.  Just too small for me.
