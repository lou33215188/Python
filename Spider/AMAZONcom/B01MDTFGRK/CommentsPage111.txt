It  is a very cute dress on and I was surprised how  pretty it was on .  My boyfriend even noticed the new dress.


You canâ€™t beat this dress for the price. This is a size large.


This dress fits perfectly! Runs true to size! The material is nice! I was looking for a dress that flatters my mid section and this dress does it!


The dress ran just a little big.  My daughter loved the dress, it looked cute on her and was appropriate for an evening wedding in January.


This dress is so amazing on. Fits better than expected and looks much more expensive. I will wesr this dress well. I look amazing in this dress. I wiil look for more dressed to buy.


Love the dress


THE PRODUCT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE ONLINE.  THE PRODUCT WAS TERRIBLE QUALITY AND I WILL NOT PURCHASE


ANYTHING ELSE.  DON'T GET FOOLED BY THE PICTURE!


Super cute... I wear a medium in shirts but ordered a large after reading other peoples reviews fits great


It was a bit too large. But I had chosen a larger size because of the reviews I read and because I would rather it big than small.


Well made dress, but too tight across the shoulders and back.
