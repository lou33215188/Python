The material felt and looked cheap. the dress was bigger than a expected


I love this dress! Great buy and the color in the picture is accurate.


Cheap fabric, but it's thick at least. The fit was not flattering on me at all. I am 5'6" 120 lbs and I ordered a medium (I usually size up with cheap clothes) and it was too big. I would say order your regular size.


Great material.. my girlfriend borrowed it and kept the dress, that's how much she loved it


Great quality. Sturdy. Fit great.


Bought this as a graduation dress and it fit perfectly. I'm a 40DDD cup and wear between a size 16 and 18. The fabric was thicker and more formal than I expected which is great! Only issue with it is that the side zipper pull sticks out. Overall a great purchase and great for all body types and sizes


I really liked the dress and dresses like this are usually VERY tight on me and I look awful so I ordered a size up and boy was a wrong... I needed my size or one size DOWN! Ordering my size!


Itâ€™s cute. I may have ordered the wrong size though


The quality isn't as great as I was hoping it'd be.


Nice dress.  Asimetric lenght gives it a nice look.
