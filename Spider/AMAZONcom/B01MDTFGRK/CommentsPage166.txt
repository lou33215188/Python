My girl looked great in this


Fit perfectly


Fit as expected


Love the dress.


Love this dress


Not the best quality but it's cute


This dress was made for a 1st grade child, if I could get away with giving it no stars I would I gave the dress away, I figured why bother returning for $20.


I like it I got what I paid for


I love it


Is nice but is small
