I loved the color, fit, price and next day delivery!


Great material, poor fit in the arms and upper torso


The dress was exactly as advertised, just too big!  Great product!


UGLY


I love the color and it fit as expected. So cute

Parents washed it three times in hot water, then it fit, and looked great. Great price!


Material sucks
