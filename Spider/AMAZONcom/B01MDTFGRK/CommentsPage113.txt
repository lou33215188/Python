I was pleasantly surprised with everything about this dress.


I'm a size 14 and purchased an XXL to wear to a wedding. My arms, chest and stomach were sausaged in to the XXL and I was spilling out everywhere. Not fair for a size 14, I'd say. If you're on the bigger side like me, I'd steer clear of this dress.


Also it's EXTREMELY short in the front. I'm 5'5" and my legs aren't even that long and it was inappropriately short even for me. Yikes!


I can see this being a great junior prom dress but not for anyone over the age of 19 or over the weight of 130.


It came in when it was projected to. Love the dress and it's comfortable!


I HAVE 3 COLORS HEHE


This dress fit really well and looked nice but the white was see through so I'm returning it.


This dress is well made with some stretch. It’s a very flattering cut as well. I’m 5’0” with a 38DD bra size and the XL fits perfect.


Super pretty dress looks exactly as shown in the picture. Form fitting material (really hugs the waist) but bottom is nice and flowy. Really pleased with the outcome :)


The material was not good and looked very cheap. The neck is quite loose and does not fit well.


Love, love this dress! True to size!


The quality of this dress leaves a lot to be desired. The material is awful...
