i love this dress i was on the edge of getting close online but it was beautiful


Ordered for Homecoming, and it was nice quality and great fit.


Love this dress! Fit perfectly and got a lot of compliments!


Love the stretchy material and the purple color!! Product is exactly as described. Thinking about purchasing another color


Beautiful color and comfortable.  The niece loves it.


Fit very well, comfy and cute! I wore this with a sparkly necklace and heels on NYE- got a lot of compliments. I ordered an XL, which is the size I usually wear- fit as expected.


I loved this. It looks great if you're on an in-between size pick the bigger one but if you're a medium id just stick with medium and let it be a little tight. Not like exceptionally tight just like body con tight.


The dress is very pretty but a little loose fitting.


Great fabric and off the shoulder, so trendy!


Loved the dress but it was too small so the size description was inaccurate.
