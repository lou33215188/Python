Great fit and good quality. Bought for my tween daughter’s first school dance and was a big hit with all her friends. Longer than I expected so made mom happy too.


Its a nice strech fabric that doenst irritate the skin. It snugs at the top and gives you the perfect loosenes of ruffle bottm.


I was so excited to get this dress to wear to my husband's Christmas work party. When I received the dress it was in a bag with a size small label on the outside of the bag, I try on the dress and it's literally falling off of me. I look at the label on the inside of the dress and it was a size large. I was so disappointed. I had to send the dress back for a refund.


It’s too short waisted for me ! I’m not crazy about the fabric ! I sent it back last week


It fit perfectly to my godaughter. She love it


Used this dress for my dress up day as Belle from beauty and the beast. It worked out perfect!


The picture is deceiving...The material is like a cheap tshirt. This is a casual dress at best.


The dress doesn't look like the picture it cheaply made and I wouldn't suggest it to one else for purchase!


Great dress! What a steal!!! Purchased this for my sister for a wedding we are attending. The only negative thing I can say about this is the color isn't exactly how you see it, I got the Rosy and it looks a little more pink then purple. She is 5'2 and weighs 130lbs. Hope this helps...


For great, NEEDS A BELT! I suggest a big black one, if u buy it you'll see why. The seem is pretty noticeable and not in the most flattering spot without a belt.
