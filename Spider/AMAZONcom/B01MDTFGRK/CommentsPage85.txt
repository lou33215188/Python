Nice material, Beatuful dress... The only thing is that the red isn't bright like in the picture


Love it !


Dress fits so perfect. I am so happy. This is something different for me.


Didn't look like the picture because the material was not as full. It just fell flat which totally ruins the look.


Great dress


I was going to give it a 5 star because it was so beautiful! I ordered it with a dress for a wedding. I tried it on with the dress and not even 10 minutes into wearing it, not messing around, the chain just snapped. So I can't even wear it to the wedding without fixing it.


Beautiful color, great fabric and the length was so beautiful.


Great dress, fits a little tighter than expected. Nice material and looks great!


If I could give them a -star I would.


The material on this dress is just like a halloween costume, no a halloween costume is even better than this dress.


I do not understand how people rate this higher than 1 star.


The dress is amazing.  Perfect fit, comfortable, nice material. I Love it
