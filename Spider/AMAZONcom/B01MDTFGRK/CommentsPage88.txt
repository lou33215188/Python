Front skirt is too low and proportions are wrong.


LOVE THE DRESS! Will buy in every color!


The material was comfortable and the fit was perfect. As someone with a rather wide ribcage, I generally feel self-conscious, but I looked great in this dress. I would definitely recommend it.


Fit just right. Flows well and is comfortable


BIEN


I really want to like it more.  Larger than I thought.


dress was as described but wasn't my cup of tea. I didn't like the material


Great dress for less than $20. I'm 5'4 165lbs and the large fit perfect. The royal blue dress is a beautiful color. I want one in every color!


Cute and comfortable fit.


I got the size medium and it did not fit well. It was too loose in the waist. Such a shame.
