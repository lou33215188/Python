Love dress online fits perfect but its not pretty until you actually put it on


Very cute and nice quality. Thank you ğŸ˜Š


I love this dress! Material is thick, it's not a see through. You definitely get your bucks worth


The color is a little bit different as it appears on the website


It was a little snug but looked great. Great dress for the price


Fits a little big and the color is more teal then green. However for the price it was worth the buy.


Not a bad fit.


The quality is not the best and the blue is not the same color as pictured. For the Price I should have expected that.


Beautiful dress!! The wine color was perfect for my Christmas photos!! Super soft and got compliments at every party I wore it to!


poor quality
