Very cute dress


Size to small , very nice


Great last minute dress! Worth the money and will wear again!


I ordered one size up because other reviews said the dress runs small. Im a large, so I ordered an XL based off of what other reviews said. Once I received it I put it on and it was way too large. I was practically swimming in it. I should've ordered a medium.


Buy this for my niece and she love it


Great fit


Cute dress but cheaply made.You get what you pay for.


love it!


I didn't like the fabric at all !!!!


Beautiful dress, fits true to size. A definite head Turner for sure.
