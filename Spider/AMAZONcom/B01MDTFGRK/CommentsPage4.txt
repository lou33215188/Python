I wanted to love this dress but ended up sending it back. The fit was as it was described but the top was so tight that it was uncomfortable. The material is really thick and it would have done perfectly for a cold evening event. It was too tight at the top so I returned it. Plus the length on me was not flattering.


Bought for my daughter, XL  she is 5'6 and around 200lbs.  She looks amazing in the dress and shoes we bought.  I would buy again,

Love this dress! It is so cute and you can wear it to any special occasion! It makes me feel very good! 227 lbs, 5'5, size 16, bought an XL


Super cute dress!  I needed it for a Beauty and the Beast dance recital and I loved it.  I'm 5'5" and 118 lbs. and I bought a small and it fit nicely since it's got some stretch in the fabric.  I was afraid it might be a little baggy and it wasn't!!  And the material is extremely durable so I'll get alot of use out of this dress in the future as well.


I love My dress! You can't go wrong!! I love review and I'm glad so many beautiful young lady's wrote about this dress .. ğŸ˜� Trust me lady for only $18 bucks you can't go wrong.


I was looking for a dress to wear to my office Christmas Party, and purchased this. I like it well enough but it doesnâ€™t look expensive. I know itâ€™s no an expensive dress, but Project Runway has given me unrealistic expectations. It is a nice slippery material, and it fits according to the regular Amazon size chart. Iâ€™m a 12/14, 36DD and ordered a large. Iâ€™m 5 foot 6 and the front hem hits a little above my knees. Iâ€™ll wear it to the party and dress it up with jewelry or a scarf but Iâ€™m not going to buy another color like I thought I might. Yes I know I need to pull the neckline down around my shoulders. :) Iâ€™m also wearing a royal blue bra under the dress and just noticed I can see it a little in the photo, so I think lighter colors are definitely going to need special undergarments. My favorite thing about this dress is that it fits my boobs and the waist seam is actually close to my natural waist, which is the smallest part of my torso. Most dresses with these seams end up looking like an empire style on me.


This dress was amazing for the white party I attended ! Fitted as expected and looks just like the photo. The material is thick enough for spring and summer seasons. I am 5,5 and weigh about 240 hopes this info helps plus size woman looking to purchase this item.


I really was scared to order this dress due to the different reviews but those that provided a picture helped my decision and I'm glad I went with my gut! I bought this dress for an all white wedding I'm attending , with the right shoes and accessories, it's perfect! The material is soft and definitely not what I expected- it is fit true to size so be sure to measure! I'm 5'3, 215lbs, I ordered an XL and fit perfect. I feel like if I had went  up a size,  it would've been too loose and not have fit right! The arms are a bit a Snug but not too tight to where I cant move! There is a zipper on the side so take that into consideration when measuring! Great Purchase and will probably Purchase again in another color! I
