Besides the fact that the material was horribly cheap, the front was SO short. Like you could honestly almost see my hoo-ha short!!


I had to return it.  Was way too small for me.  I'm a natural size 14 and my bra size is a 40DD.  These boobs didn't zip up.


I had a lot of compliments wearing this dress! a must have! I am 5'3 and 175 lbs and this is perfect!


The dress looks cute online but when it comes in... You'll be in for a shocker! It's not the color you would expect ( I got the eggplant color) it was more of a true purple. The material is thick but cheap! Its jersey material, definitely not a fancy dress.


The green is way more like kelly green than hunter green. I had to use black dye to get it to the color I wanted. But after that I loved it.


OMG I love this dress. I wore it to a symphony concert and I had so many eyes on me and received a lot of pleasant compliments. You HAVE to buy this dress.


I ordered a bright red....and man is it bright. It's about two shades brighter than the picture posted! I should have ordered the regular red, although a review stated theirs was more pink than red when ordering that one. It's still a cute dress. It runs a bit small, and the hi-lo fashion of the bottom is much more subtle than the picture depicts.


The dress is really cute, nice fabric for the price. If ran small and short for me. I'm 5'9" 135  pounds. I typically wear a size 2 or 4. I bought the medium and it was snug and way short. If not for the length, I'd try to find a size that fits, but I'm returning.


Go large if you think you are a medium.. front is not as short in the front like picture appears .. it's like all the same length ..


This dress is amazingly perfect!! The material is better than what I was expecting and it fits like a glove!! I buying it in more colors! Definitely go by the sizing chart if you're not sure what size to buy.
