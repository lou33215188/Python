Absolutely gorgeous dress and fit perfect!


I rarely bother to write reviews but I love this dress so much. Doesn't look cheap, fits perfectly, don't make my D boobs look weird without wearing a bra and can't see my nipples through the thick and good material. Love it.


Very nice for the price love the material


It fit perfectly


I ordered a 2x


Love this dress. Bought it for a trip to Vegas. Will definitely wear it again for a wedding.


Super adorable, and a little bit stretchy. Beautiful!!


I bought this dress for our Anniversary and it is so beautiful! I am 5'0 and 150lbs and it looked really slimming! The material is thicker but the dress still breathes. I would purchase again!!


My only complaint is I expected a different material, but I am still super excited about this dress.


looks cheaper in person


The zipper was off track had to send back


Fit as expected but I looked frumpy in this dress. It was not the look I wanted for my party. Returning this dress but I ordered another from this company and I love it ‚ù§
