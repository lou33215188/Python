it fits perfectly


Bought for my daughter's winter formal dance. Very nice fit. Love the material.


I received the wrong dress.  I ordered the dress in the picture but received a different dress.


The color was a little off, it's lighter than it looks in the picture.  The dress does fit well.


Bought to wear to a wedding an I absolutely love it !


Came in and fit great!


This dress is a steal! $20 and it's dang sexy! I am 5'5", 134 lbs and fairly hourglass, fits bomb! Fairly dense fabric that drapes very well. Love the style!


Looks beautiful on! Vibrant color and perfect fit!


Side seam below zipper was not sewn. 4" opening.


It was too small
