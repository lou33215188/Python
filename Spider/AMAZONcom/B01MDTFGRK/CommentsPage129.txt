Really cute dress just to short in the front for a school dance. Will wear only with leggings.


Beautiful


Not as long in the back as I thought it was going to be. It doesn't really look like a high/low dress.


lots of compliments. love this dress!!


It is smaller than expected and the zipper was broken.


Over all it was good just a smidge too large


Amazing dress! I'm 5' 4" 130lbs and I bought this dress in a sz small and it fits perfect. Flows pretty around me. I'm in love with this dress.


This dress is amazing! The quality is good and I got so many compliments on it!


Way too short


Quick shipping, nice quality material
