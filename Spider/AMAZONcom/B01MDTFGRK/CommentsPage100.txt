Order a size above what u wear. It's pretty n it fits just to small to be able to relax without girls playing peekaboo


Nice dress for the price. The material does feel a bit cheaper than I expected. It's very stretchy though.


My new favorite dress!! I'm a 36 b so the medium fits perfectly. The material feels nice and is easy to clean. Love this dress.


Sexy fun cute. Obsessed with this dress


The material looks pretty cheap and the color is not the color in the photo


Love the dresss perfect


Nice dress, but stitching around the chest came loose.


It's a little more snug than I expected. Has a little half zipper on the side. I had to keep it zipped to put it in properly. Lol  But it looks beautiful on. I can't wait to eat it on a night out.


The color was a Kelly green and not the dark green I expected from the picture. It fit as expected though!


Perfect for a November wedding! I was a little nervous about the fit but it fit perfectly and looked great!
