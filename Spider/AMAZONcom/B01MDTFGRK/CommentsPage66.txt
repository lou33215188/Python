The dress is fine, just a lil too short for my tastes. I'm 5'7". I may end up giving it to my daughter.


I wore this dress out to Red Lobsters and received compliments. Fit as expected. This dress is acknowledged every where I go.


Love this dress, fits great, its comfortable and high quality fabric, and the sleeves don;t slip or ride up onto your shoulders. Wearing this to two different weddings this weekend and can't wait!


Ordered a larger size due to other reviews. My daughter looked beautiful in the dress. I would highly recommend this dress.


Great buy for the price! I normally would've ordered an XL but was nervous that it may be too snug in the middle so I ordered up. Wish I hadn't. I would say it runs TTS. Not see through, good thick material.


Love this dress! It's very comfortable, classy and sexy. Can't beat that price either


Gift for gd.She loved it.


I love the dress!!! It fits exactly as the pix and true to size. I bought an XL; 220 lbs and 5'5. It is short in the front but super cute on!


It was shorter than I expected. I ordered my size, but I was big on me. The top part looked different in person. It worked for what I needed it for, but it was not my favorite.
