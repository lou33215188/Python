Beautiful dress


We had to have it altered a bit, but it was a wonderful dress, my daughter loves it.


A must buy!! I Love it!! Im going to buy the white and red next!!


It does run small I ordered up only by 1 size. That worked for me. The color is nice also.


SO short in the front!  The fabric is a cheap stretchy fabric that reminded me of a dance costume.  Definitely returned it.


Perfect birthday dress, love it so much


Haven’t worn it out yet but did try it on and it’s a perfect fit


Very figure flattering dress!


It's a flattering dress and fit well. I ordered it in purple and it was lighter  than what it looked like in the picture but still nice!


Very cute and comfortable.  It's a really cute dress.
