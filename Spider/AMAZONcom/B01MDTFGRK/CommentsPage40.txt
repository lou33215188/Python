It arrived on time fits as per my order apart from being polyester material it's a good design


I received this dress 3 days after I bought it and this dress was a very good quality. I bought this dress as a gift for my sister and she loves it. The stitching was nicely done, it was true in size, and the color was very radiant. I will buy another dress again in a different color for myself


Made from polyester, thick polyester...um no.  Maybe I missed that part in the description.


Love it & True to size.. I ordered a LG and I'm 5'2, 170 lbs.


perfect for a 5'4.  might get short if you are taller


Cute!  The fabric is sort of reminiscent of a bathing suit.  If you are large in the bust, go up a size.


Such a flattering dress! The Hem on my dress was spot on with the picture and the top is really made to sit on the sides of your arms, you don't have to keep it pulled down. It stays. The upper part of the dress does fit really snug with a tiny bit of stretch. This is going to be a great date dress!


Very nice material and color! Great dress for the price.


The dress is heavy with no tag or any label on how to clean. I order the yellow one for an event but I think it would like better in another color but it does fit once you go up a size so I will make it work and you get what you pay for but overall it's not that bad just heavy


My Daughter Loves ❤️ This Dress With room to grow.
