Adorable dress that my 15 yr old wore for her homecoming dance.


Perfect fit. Nice material. Very cute on with pearl accessories.


love this dress. the material is thick, good for the price


I absolutely LOVE this dress. It is perfect for a date night or holiday event. I utilized the measurements provided and for me it was true to size. It even arrived a day sooner than expected, Bonus!


Good product...would buy again.


Great price, my daughter purchased this dress for a winter formal she wasn’t expecting to go. Changed her mind last minute, couldn’t find anything she really liked after going store to store. I told her to go on here since time was running out and it is exactly what she had in mind.


I absolutely love this dress! The dress is made of nice material and accentuates the right areas. I`m normally a 4-6 in dresses but ordered the medium. If you are on the shorter side (I`m 5'4) the front of the dress does hit a bit lower than shown in the product pictures. All in all, I would order this dress again.


I loved this dress!! It was very well made and true to size.  I will be ordering it again I  another color. I got so many compliments.


The material is cheap, and not what it looks like in the photo.  Returning.  Too bad, the cut is a good design.


This is an absolutely beautiful dress. The material is of poor quality and you can see the pattern and stitching of my undergarments (including the print of my upper anatomy). I would not recommend buying this if you are going anywhere except to lay by a pool.
