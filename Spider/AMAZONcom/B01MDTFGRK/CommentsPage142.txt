Love it!!


Beautiful fit...perfect dress for casual as well as dressy occasions


I didn't like it at all.the front was too short.the fabric was horrible


Absolutely love the color, the material and the fit.


its a nice dress but the fabric is a bit heavy and there is a weird seam in the middle. Other than that very pretty


The style of the dress did not suit me that's why I decided to return it.


Super cute dress and super comfy for a fun dress.


The fabric feels incredibly soft and flexible!


I love this dress and it fit me well


The package said small. The dress is a medium. Disappointing.
