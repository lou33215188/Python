The top is a little awkward. It was a little tight in the shoulders and a little loose in the stomach. With a cover up it was still perfect!


Cheaply made, unflattering dress that I returned. Looked good online, but not on me


I'm5'3". I ordered an XL. It fits great! I got the front shortened. It was too short for me. I loved it so much, I ordered it in white!


I ordered a small in purple  and it looked really bad. The dress was too big and I’m normally a 4-6 dress size. The color was cute but the size was way off. The material is like a loose nylon and polyester blend. I didn’t return it because it’s not worth the hassle.


Fits beautifully, reallt nice heavy material


I ordered this dress for a dance at school. It was somewhat baggy around the chest, but that wasn't a big deal because my mom would just pin it to make it fit better. It was a beautiful color and I would have worn it, but when I lifted my arms the front came up very high to the point that you could see everything under the dress. I will wear the dress but it would be to events where my arms will be staying at my sides.


Loved this dress, wore it to a wedding in NYC and even the wedding planner approached me asking where had I gotten this dress. Very comfortable, true to size and beautiful color.


Black is best, it looks better than the thin stretchy material that it is.  I ordered royal blue, looks cheap.


Pretty dress, but I am tall and the mid section was too short for my body so it looked like and empire waist.


Beautiful dress.. a little short in the front for an over 50 lady but really pretty!  Great fabric, hangs well, no ironing just hung it up, wrinkles fell out.. ready to wear!
