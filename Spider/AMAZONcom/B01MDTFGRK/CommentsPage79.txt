This dress looks a lot cuter in the pictures. It definitely runs small and the elastic band is very tight on my shoulders. I'll be returning this.


Fast delivery and great color. I am usually always a medium, but wish I would have ordered the small.  I didn't even need to use the zipper to put on. I am a size 6/8 and B bra size.


I got a lot of complements on this dress. SZ 14  ordered xl


i'm so upset,the size is too small,and it isn't uncomfortable,it's a terrible shopping experience!


great fit


Somewhat short in the middle but dont let that keep you from wearing it, I just put tights or leggings and it still looks amazing! The size was right on point!


Perfect


Cute but the waste comes up a little higher than I would like.


Polyester material not cotton like I  expected


Dress fit as expected but doesn't look as nice as in the picture. However, still a great buy and can definitely dress it up.
