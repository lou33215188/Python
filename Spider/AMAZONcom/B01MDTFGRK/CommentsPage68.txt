bought it for my daughter who wear small in size.  material is porous and cheap.  does not stand out as it looks in the picture.


Excelente ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️


The dress fits my daughter beautifully.


I ordered a small and I’m kinda shocked that it fit me a bit too big considering I usually have to get a medium because of my breast. I’m a 32 DDD. But I am pretty skinny I’m 5’1” and I weigh 108-115 lbs. It’s a nice dress, would buy again if it would have fit me.


The material is soft, love it. Fit perfect, truly like the picture.


The zipper broke within 5 minutes of me putting it on. I'm glad I ordered it in advance so I could reorder before my event. It is really cute and definitely worth the $20. I am 5'9" 170 and a b cup and the medium was a little snug on me which is what size I normally wear in skater dresses.


Love this dress and the fit. I have nothing to say against this dress.


I’m 5’2”, 248lbs 43bust 35waist and 54hips. I usually wear 18/xl, but I wanted to fit me a little more loose so I got xxl and it fits GREAT!!!! Very Flowy with a slight looose fit in the arms and waist.


Stunning dress. I love it so much, and received so many compliments wearing it. I am 5'8 and 135 pounds, so my size was perfect.


Awesome dress true to size. Material stretches to fit.
