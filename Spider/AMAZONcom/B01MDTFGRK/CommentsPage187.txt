Material was incredibly thin, much larger than expected, and did not seem to look like a dress- looked more like thin fabric sown together. Very disappointed because I was really looking forward to it arriving :(


Does not look like pictures posted on the slim lady.


Perfect for the captain's dinner on a cruise


The dress is beautiful, but the top part (waist up) is too large...


The bottom part is perfect.


I'll need to shape it (the top part).


Not what i expected


Great fit as expected. Non transparent and thick enough to not need full undergarments


It fits like a babydoll dress. Not becoming at all. Pmus, the material looks and feels very cheap.


I love this so much I am 4'11 and this dress was amazing! My dress came in a color brighter than I expected.


Fit perfectly wore it to for my cousins homecoming think of ordering and in an other color for my homecoming I absolutely loved it


This was a gift to my daughter. It was too small and she was not happy with how it fit. She is having difficulty figuring our how to send it back
