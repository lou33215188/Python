this dress fit soo cute it fit true to size


just received this dress today, I am 5' 10, and after reading all the reviews i was a little leary about how short it is in the front, but  once i tried it on it's fits great, very pleased with it, it comes above my knees about  3" not so bad, itl's no shorter than a mini dress , and the color is spot on, can't wait until my nephews wedding in a week!!!

But to big for my daughter I have to change for small size  is beautiful dress ğŸ‘—


You can see right thru the top :(


Dress fit well and was lovely...but if you have flaws they will for sure show!


Absolutely adore this dress! Ordered a Large and I can't wait to wear it. My measurements: 36D/DD, 32 waist, 42 hips (size 10). If your waist is more than 34 inches, its best to go the next size up.


Got this in black and looks so sophisticated and sexy. Wore this to my friends graduation ceremony with gold accessories and the look was very elegant!


its nice. I thought the top would be ruched elastic and it was more of a cotton material though. Still for being polyesterish it isn't bad. Comfortable. Not super flattering on my stomach, im a bigger girl.


It runs small I needed a larger size


Beautiful Dress! I could wear for it for multiple occasions and it fits just rightâ€¦ Fabric is nice and soft but sturdyâ€¦ wont rip on you. Not sewn poorlyâ€¦


The dress looks great, but I had to return it due to a stitching problem on arrival. I'll buy it again to see if the next one is made correctly. For reference, I'm 5 ft 2 in and about 140 pounds and ordered medium for a form fit.
