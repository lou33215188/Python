I will be returning this item. VERY SMALL not true fit. cheap material


Order one size up. Nice dress for price.


Shipping was super fast. Fit great. The zipper was broken upon receipt but the seamstress was adding a little rhinestone belt anyway so the zipper was an easy fix.  Definitely doable for a 12 yr old middle school formal.... and definitely doable On the price!


In love ğŸ˜�


I bought this dress to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  I am a size 12/14 and bought a large.  Dress fitted perfectly


If you are small chested, this would probably work better for you. I had to return mine as it looked a bit ridiculous.


It was not flattering to my figure and I really didn't like the material...


It s a nice dress


Wasn't flattered at all. Looked nothing like the dresses pictures.


Beautiful quality
