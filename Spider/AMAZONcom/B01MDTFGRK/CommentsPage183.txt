I got the large 34-36-45 185 LBS 5'1, but I am returning, I thought it would be light and summery, it was very heavy to wear for the summer... Nice dress, but I am looking for something light in HOT days, ill sweat my butt of in this material..


Great customer service!


Thicker, stretchy, comfortable, good fabric for the price...flattering fit...exceeded my expectations for the price...perfect sunny yellow color...fast shipping


I loved;)


Five stars because it fits well and seems to be well made. Dont love the cut as much as I thought I would... its too long in the back on someone short like me (5'1") - Maybe this summer when I get a tan and can wear cute heels I will like it better.


This dress is really beautiful, for the price it exceeded my expectations. The top really enhances one's figure and the bottom part (the skirt) falls beautifully. Planning on buying a second one in black. The blue one is perfect. Will post pictures in the near future. True to size.


Great for casual or dressy events! My niece and daughter both loved it that they are also ordering one soon!


Dress fit perfect. I received so many compliments


Overall a good purchase... fabric could be better but still a great dress for the price


The dress fit nicely and is a beautiful blue. Many compliments! I bought the burgundy one too!


I love this dress!
