Aside from being super short in the front. Too small based on the size chart,  and the material reminding me of Esmeralda on bewitched, this dress had marker all over it.


Not like how it looks on the pic


I'm 5'4 120 lbs and a medium fits perfectly! Love the color and flowey-ness!


beautiful


I Love It!!ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€


Faulty zipper, but Beautiful color and material.


Very nice


Dress not as it appears in the pictures.


The fabric looks and feels very bad, it's too larg. Can't return it as I have to travel.


Fits so great! Super cute!
