It looks amazing! I'm 5'1Â½ ft and 108.5 lbs and I believe I got a small If not a extra small. I'm very satisfied with this product.


I order a large but next time I think a medium would have been better. Overall nice dress


Fits beautifully, I do suggest going up a size.  Other than that the material is nice and it's a lovely red.


Purchased for my daughter and it is true to size .


This dress is super cute, material is thick and seems of good quality :) super happy with it, would love to buy more in different colors.


Honestly fantastic for the price-- I had many compliments on this. Im 5'4, 120# and the small fit perfectly.


Bought this for my daughter for a college event. It was very classy and comfortable.


Perfect!!!


Beautiful dress & material but came with a dark stain on hem in FRONT of dress. :(


Super surprised by the thick material. Feels sturdy and can handle a wash without shrinking immediately. Dress is stretchy but has a side zipper to help ease on. Looveee it.
