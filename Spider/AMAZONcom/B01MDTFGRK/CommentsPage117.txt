My daughter got it for a school dance and it fit perfectly. She loved it.


fabric for dress was cheat look, and not suitable for a dinner dance I had to attend. Not please with dress at all.


Absolutely love the dress but will be sending it back for a larger size. Material is great


Love this dress. I can wear it on dates and church. Thinking about getting the same dress in black!!


I bought this dress for my very picky daughter to wear for her 12th grade graduation and she absolutely loves it!!


Shiny material...not what I expected


If I lost another 5-10 pounds like I'm planning to it'll fit perfectly. Otherwise it's beautiful and soft. Should be very comfy once I lose the weight.


wife loves it


Fantastic piece! It's a little short in the front for my 5'9" size, but leggings look great with it!! The blue is gorgeous.


Like the style and fit of the dress- NOT a fan of the horrible, thick, synthetic fabric.
