This was indecently short in the front on me, and I am only 5'6". I ordered a small. Would be cute if you're shorter!


unfortunately it did not fit how I wanted & have to return it.


love it, stains come out great in it too. Fit just right


It runs a little small but still a good fit. Overall it's a cute dress. The material is a little different than expected but still a nice summer dress.


Recently gained a bunch of weight and have been stressing trying to find something to wear for a wedding I have coming up but even as a larger girl, it fits cute and makes me feel comfortable. Thanks :)


Cute needs a belt


Haven't worn it out yet.  I tried it on.  Nice light weight material.  Looking forward to wearing it!


It's a nice dress, I think you will have to get a size up, if you want it to last awhile. Looks great on my daughter.


I am 5' 2" and it is way too short in the front for my taste. I thought since I was shorter it would fall a little longer on me than the model but the picture is pretty true to length on my height.


Good price and quality. Very cute design
