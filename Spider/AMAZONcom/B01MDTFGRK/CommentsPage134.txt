The dress in the picture is not what I received. Very disappointed.


It just the way I like it no I want to get different colors forsure


I really wanted to love this dress. However, the neckline (which seems almost seamless as pictured) was a huge bulky hem. It wasn't so much an off the shoulder dress as it was a boatneck someone stretched just a little. The yellow material was somewhat see-through in the tush. And finally there was an unnecessary zipper under the arm trying to body shame me. The Medium fit me with room (146lbs, C cup, 5'5") but the zipper was acting like I was squeezing into it. It kept jamming and then doing that slow peel from the top as if my shape was resisting which it wasn't. I've squeezed into things before - this dress wasn't one of them. When I got the zipper to stay in place it made the bodice of the dress seem lopsided as the darts no longer matched up.


Very impressed thick material made well fits perfect!! Worth way more then i paid!!!


Shoulders are too tight
