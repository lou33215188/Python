The dress is okay. The color is the same is in the pictures, but maybe a bit darker. Unfortunately the shoulder sleeves are a tight for me, and the dress smells distinctly of ink.


It's a little snug for a large, but not too bad. Still zips and fits! Good quality and thick fabric. The front is a bit short, but I can work with it.


It's fine...I wish the shoulders were a little lower. The material isn't what I expected either.. It's like a dance costume... A good product though!! I just don't like it...


Received order yesterday, which was a day early and I liked that. Was excited about trying on but to my surprise and disappointment it was too dang small. I could only fit one of my arms inside. Thank god I ordered two dresses or i would of been without a dress a party this weekend.


Love this dress!


I truly loved this outfit. This dress was worn at an annual Christmas dance, and it worked out PERFECTLY!!.


wouldn't fit


The material is thicker than I expected but it fits great!


Ordered this for a formal wedding- got so many compliments about how well it fit and how cute it was.


What a bargain!


Fits as expected. Item as described.
