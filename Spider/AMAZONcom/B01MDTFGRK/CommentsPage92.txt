This is a lovely dress.  The materials is heavier than I thought, but it worked fine for a night out on the town!


I loved this dress. I wore it on my honeymoon and it fit beautifully. I have a hard time with sizes varying too much but this fit really well.


Material was cheap and it did not match the dress pictured. The top of the dress doesnâ€™t be even look the same as the picture.  I would not recommend buying it.


I bought this for my roommate and she loves it.


Horrible fit. Nothing like the preview pics


Runs large. Ordered a small and it fits like a medium..


I was expecting better material. But it ended up being spandex material. Dress fits to form, sooooo may not wear it without losing some LBs lol


Fits about 1/2 size to small but otherwise perfect fabric is good quality and it was shipped right on time Thanks!


Bought to wear for a wedding and got tons of compliments. The dress is comfortable and very flattering. Material is fitting the body I'm usually a medium but the medium was a bit too big so I got a small and it fit perfectly.


Made me look like I was in my 3rd trimester.


Great for dancing! Love this dress - have it in black too!
