Good material but a little snug. Maybe if I lose 15lbs it will fit better.


Nice dress good color fit well but poorly made zipper wasn't stitched all the way in the armpit area so I had to sew it and cut some bad stitching out, lots of loose strings.


It’s so cute! I bought it for my work Christmas party in a month it came way faster then expected and I’m okay with that!


weird fit. didn't not like. sending back


I wish I had a taken a full length picture!! I recieved A LOT of compliments. I bought  size large because I wear a 36C bra. I'm short but the length was just right.


Perfect fit. Ordered for my daughter homecoming n it looks beautiful!


Cute dress just not for me. It’s shorter than expected in the front and very tight in the chest area. Found a whole in the seam by the zipper. It seems cheaply made even though the material is pretty thick. Might be cuter on a thin frame.


I'm 5' tall and just had a baby so my boobs are massive, didn't fit even without a bra! So it could've been cute if it wasn't for that lol ordered a small.


Fit great and it was nice to have extra material in back of dress since I have a bigger bottom.


This dress makes me feel beautiful!!! Can't wait to wear it to attend a cousin's wedding next week.
