Very nice I love itğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ


The dress itself is good but the model in the photo made the dress look sexier than what was received. Ended up wearing it, and the size was very roomy. Does not look the way I expected it too but no other complaints.


Seriously this dress is awesome! I was concerned about the quality base on price, but it is great! There is even a side zipper! I love the fit and the blue color is out of this world! Can't wait to wear it for date night! I'm 5'5" and 108 lbs and the Small is a great fit!


Great dress!


I bought this for an outing but didnâ€™t like the fit for me so Iâ€™m gifting it to my niece


Super cute dress. A little hard to move around in. I was looking for a dress I could dance in and not have to worry about and readjust a bunch. This wasn't it.


Way to short in the front


I bought it for my cousin and it's absolutely amazing!!! We love it and got a lot of compliments! It accentuates her waist and looks super good on her! â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�


Its cute, but material is heavy, too heavy for summer wear. Kind of bummed.


great
