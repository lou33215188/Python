The material is far better than expected and very comfortable. Downside is the front is alot shorter than shown and the dress was smaller than the chart shows.


Just got the dress today. For the most part, the dress is very nice and the material is excellent. The only thing that I’m not happy about is the color. The yellow is not as bright as the picture it’s more dull. My instincts should of stayed with the blue instead


it's cute enough


Okay design, giving only 3 stars as below expectation. Can be better.


Great material! The fit is awesome! Can be worn off the shoulders or on the shoulders. Bright blue color. Just like the picture.


I love the red color. That's about it. The design of this dress would make more sense with a different material. It's an elegant design, the material is rather cheap and feels too ordinary, not a great match


The material is thick and will fit your curves nicely.


Loved the dress. I'm 5'8" and 230 pounds. I ordered the 2xl and it for like a dream. Thick material and beautiful plum color. I got so many compliments. Wore it to a casual wedding.


Bought this for my college graduation. Love it! Amazing quality for the price. I'm 5 foot 1 and 110 pounds and the small was perfect. I was worried about cleavage on the top and bottom (I like to dress modestly) but this dress ended up fitting just how I wanted it.


This dress is reasonable priced. Runs super small.
