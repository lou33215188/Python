It's super cute! I got for my son birthday. My family dress up as monster inc characters. I went as boo. The dress was perfect fit and super comfortable. Which was a must because I was running around like crazy


Color and fit was exactly as expected. I'm 5'11 so I always worry about length but this will work with our without leggings. I haven't washed it yet though so I'm not sure if it will shrink.


I'm 5'1 and got a size small in red and navy blue. They both fit and look great! However, the red one is a little longer which I thought was a little strange. The material is soft and not see-through. I would definitely order this again in other colors.


Love the material & fits great. True to size


I love wearing this little dress with leggings!  It is so comfortable!


Perfect everyday dress!


Fits and color as shown in the photos. Very comfortable. Quite plain so it should be dressed up. Wrinkles release fairly quickly.


Cute but ran alittle large.


Just don't buy it for some reason this dress loves static!


Such a cute dress!  I found it to fit true to size. It was a little short to be a dress on me... but perfect to wear with leggings!!  I love how it hugs the right places well so it gives shape while also not being tight.  I ordered the black short sleeve dress and I am excited to order more!
