Love this dress.  Easy and casual.  Fun for weekends!


Its perfect


Many compliments.  Very happy.


The tunic was much longer than I expected, I am 5'3", but I have shorter legs.


Very short. Cheap fabric. Will be returning.


Very comfortable and soft


Loved the product and the feel of it


My new favorite dress!!!


It's cute but WAY too little. Fits more like a small.  Not even a medium.


Not complimentary for a larger build. It shows every imperfection.
