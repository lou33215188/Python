It is really baggy, Not fitted at all. I will need to have it taken in some on the sides.


Great material


Love it! Super cute and comfy!


Love this little dress fits perfect Very comfortable


Love the material, the color, the fit, the price! I'm 5'3" and 129lbs ordered a medium it fit great.


Cute little T-shirt dress. I am 5'2 and it hits right above the knee.


Will be returning :( I had high hopes for this dress as the reviews are mostly nice. This dress runs HUMONGOUS!!! Order at least 2 sizes smaller than you need if you decide to get this. Colors are different than shown. Overall, pretty cheap feeling too. Wish it was better!


I didn't end up keeping this dress. Nothing wrong with it, just not for me.


Nothing more than a t-shirt nightgown. For the AZ summers, a cool housedress. Would not wear in public.


Greatest dress ever!  I can dress it up with accessories or wear it casual.  It's super soft and comfy.  I love it so much I bought 2.
