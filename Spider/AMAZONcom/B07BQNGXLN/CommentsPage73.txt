Loved this dress. The colour was just as stated and it fits so well. Definitely a great summer dress, or it could be used for layering in all seasons.


Pretty but runs small as I normally wear a xl.


Received this dress last week. Actually wore it out tonight and I love it! Great fit, decent quality for the price. Went back online and ordered three more in different colors.


Great dress


poor fabric


Nice and comfortable dress for a hot summer night.


Did not like the color...gave it to a friend !


Super cute and comfortable!


I love this dress!!! Ordered 4 in different colors. Perfect for summer, you can't go wrong.


Very comfortable
