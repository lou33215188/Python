I'm going to buy it in every color! It's amazing!!!!


Super comfy and soft. Perfect for hot weather. Easy to dress up with jewelry. Bought XL 'cause my hips don't lie. Great fit. I don't expect the material to go the long haul, but at the price, easy to dupe in the closet.


Is soft, but too big on me. Bought the small and I'm 5'2", 110lbs, 34a or b. I put a belt on and it looks cute.


I'm 5'8" and 170lbs.


with an athletic build. It was long enough on me and not see through. Super comfy and just the right amount of flow. Will be  ordering more.


I bought this in navy medium for myself and pink small for my daughter.  The fit is good, but the fabric is thin -- a slip was needed with the pink.  Very comfortable.


Fabric too synthetic


love this dress. I own in different colors. Very comfy and versatile. You can wear it for casual days or dress it up with adding some jewelry and heels. Overall awesome dress!!


Love it! Just had knee surgery and it is perfect for recuperating.


Fit as expected. Color is exactly as shown. Love it!


Fits great, very soft!
