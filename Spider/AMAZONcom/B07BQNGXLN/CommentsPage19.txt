Super comfy! The sleeves are a little long for me but I just rolled them up. The dark green color is more of a dark teal but I like it either way


I love this dress!  I read other reviews and found that many others said this as well.  The dress is described as a "thin" fabric, but I purchased the black and felt it had nice coverage.  I plan to purchase other colors.  I will say that the fit is slightly more snug in the top, but I the arm coverage is nice and the length works perfectly.


Really like this dress. It is lightweight, not see through and you can dress it up or down. I am able to pair it with nice shoes and accessories for work or just throw on to run errands. Fits very nicely as shown in the picture


So. CUTE! I am 5'4" 130# and purchased a size small and it fits perfectly! Material is also great!


Machine washed in cold/cold and hung dry on dryer rack. No shrinking or color fading. Dress can easily be dressed up or down, worn with heels or boots, necklace or scarf, as is or with jacket. Very versatile. Incredibly comfortable fit across bust and waist and flows so around naval and hips, which is why I wear this when I expect to gorge myself with a big dinner.


Not terrible but the fabric is much lower quality than I expected or what I thought from the description. The style is cute and the fit is good but I sent these back because I couldn't stand the material.


These dresses are perfect. I love them, they are cute and comfy.


Fits well and super comfy. Nice fabric for the price,  a great casual dress for the weekend


I'm 5'10, 150# and ordered medium. Super comfy and I wear it with tights. Wrinkles pretty easily, but it was less than $20, so I don't care. Will order more colors!


I love this dress! I'm 5'4, 175lbs, and a G cup and the extra large fits me perfectly. The material is soft and has some stretch to it.
