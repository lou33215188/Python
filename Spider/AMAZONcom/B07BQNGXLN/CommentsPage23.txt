Bought dusty rose, black, blue and LS army green.  All great!  I'm 5'7" 137 lbs and medium fits great.  I have worn them with leggings or tights but I think the dress is long enough to wear without in the summer.  I had never bought a T-shirt dress because I thought it wouldn't be flattering but these are.  Have to hand wash and air dry though.


This was a  just because gift for my wife.  She just loved it.  It is one of her favourites.  Colour was also very nice for her.


Comfortable and Iove the neckline. It's hard to buy any shirt or dress that does not show cleavage. Sometimes it is nice to put them away. Soft & comfortable.


I love this dress.  It fit perfect and it was good quality material that you cannot see through.  I will definitely be ordering more colors!


Loooooke these!! So comfortable! I have two blacks and a gray. The gray is a little smaller than the blacks but barley. Wear them all the time!


Love, love, love, love, love this dress.  It's perfect and I can dress it up or down depending upon where I need to wear it!  It's definitely a super find!


Cute summer dress, looking forward to wearing it when it warms up. Material is good quality, but a little thin.


I love this dress. It's made well and comfortable to wear. You can dress it down and you can dress it up with this simple little dress. I need to get more colors!


Great quality material and so cute and flowy! I got a large and am 5'5" and 140lbs and it fit great! It's tight around the chest area then is really loose and flowy. Can be either dressed up or down which I love! So comfortable!


This dress is super comfy!  The material is so soft and light, but not see-through.  Because i am on the short side, I belted mine to give my waist a little shape. The color is beautiful and I hope to purchase another in a different color soon!
