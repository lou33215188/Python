I bought the gray round neck dress and will be returning it.  I looked forward to getting this to wear in the hot summer months. I am petite and the dress comes to my knees (which is okay since the dress is flows). The neckline is kind of odd and crinkled.  I don't know if this is because I am petite and don't have wide shoulders.  Overall, I would have kept it for weekend wear if not for the overwhelming chemical smell.  It makes me worry about what kind of dye was used that would result in such a strong smell and of course this was also made in China.


I needed a comfortable royal blue dress for sorority purposes. This dress did not disappoint! It's super comfortable and doesn't show my weird hip shape (thank goodness). I was worried about the length of the dress, but it is the perfect length. Not too long and not too short! Thinking about getting some more in different colors!


Love this dress!!! So comfortable and flattering! I will buy more in different colors.
