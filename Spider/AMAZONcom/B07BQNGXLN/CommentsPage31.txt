Very flimsy not fot big busts. The material smells funky. I have washed this 4 times trying to get rid of the smell. For the cost I guess I got what I paid for


Love this dress. Perfect, flattering fit. Great for summer or with a cute kimono. Go buy every color!


This dress fits great. I ordered according to the size chart provided and was not disappointed. It's a perfect summer dress for the heat in Texas because it's thin enough to not be heavy but not so thin that it's see-through.


Cute, comfortable, and perfect fabric weight for summer. Fit as expected.


Super comfy and cute, but nice enough for work. Loved it so much I bought two more! I get lots of compliments on this dress.


I love the weight of the material but it is very unforgiving and shows all of my fat rolls. I got a Large, I'm 5'4" 170lbs and a 36DD


The material is so soft. It also does not cling to your body, which I was worried about. I bought it for a costume/ Halloween (Miss Viola Swamp) but, I will definitely be wearing this all year round.


Its adorable and super comfortable. Fits perfectly - cheap enough that I will be buying in a bunch of colors


The fabric is too thin and the collar looked stretch. Not very happy with it . Very poor quality.


I absolutely love this dress!  I've bought it in two colors and I'm getting a couple more.  Thick enough material that it flows nicely and with a quick spritz with an anti-wrinkle spray it hangs perfectly.  I've gotten lots of compliments and everyone is amazed at the quality... nicer than old navy and gap!
