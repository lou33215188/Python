Kinda see through really long PROBABLY a size or 2 less than your original size would be good

Comfortable.


These are amazing dresses I've came back and bought 2 more since the first one. Super light and comfy and fit really well


perfect!!!


This dress is quite big compared to expectation and the images, would be comfier however it looked more like a baggy sleepshirt than a casual dress


I really like it but it is see-through....So I have not worn it out of the house.
