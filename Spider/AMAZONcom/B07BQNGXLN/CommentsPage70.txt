I could live in this dress. Seriously considering buying one in every color. Really comfortable and keeps me cool in the hot summer months.


Super comfy and for the price! Perfect as good as Lula!


Beautiful. Brought for a dress to wear in DR on vacation and it was perfect to wear to dinner or over a bathing suit


Love this dress.  Very comfy.  I am 5'8 and it is a little short.  Great dress to throw on after work, to run to grocery or lounge around


Runs very large. Looked like a night gown. Returned it


The dress/ tops fit perfectly.  Absolutely true to size.  Soft comfy fabric but not clingy or flimsy.  Great price for quality garments!


the material is so soft but order larger


Returned it.... it fit like a tent


Fits true to size very soft and comfortable. Im 5â€™3 and it hits me right above the knee.


Great quality, nice and breathable material. It's not too short, exactly as shown in the picture.
