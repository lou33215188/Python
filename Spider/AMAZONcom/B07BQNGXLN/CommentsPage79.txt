Fabric is thinner than expected.


Really nice material and good fit.

Loved it


Loved the color but ordered same dress twice...both were defective with a faded streak down front at the neckline.


Nice and comfortable.

I love it!! So soft and comfortable!


Very comfortable and cute-especially under a long cozy sweater with cute boots!
