Love these dresses. I have 3 colors. I'm 5'10" and these are long enough to make me feel both covered and sexy. The are so comfy and can be worn alone or with leggings or rights


Super soft and comfortable! Fits well and love the color. Unfortunately it's one of those fabrics that wrinkles really easily so it may just be a dress that gets worn around the house.


this fits like a large tshirt. I am short 4'11 looks like a borrowed my husband tshirt and tried to wear it as a dress not happy


The perfect little black dress. Its comfortable which makes it even more amazing. You can dress it up or make it casual. Love this and will buy more in different colors!


This dress is just what I was looking for!  Being 5'4" 160#, I ordered the large in both black and blue.  The color and material are amazing!  It falls just above my knees and fits great!  Being a "mature" woman (59), I was afraid it would be too young for me but it is the perfect shopping dress for  when we go on vacation.  I will order a few more in different colors.  Love, Love, Love it!!


I am a size 6 and ordered a medium size yet returned this dress as it was larger than expected. If you look closely at the picture of the dress, the model's arms are slightly pinching the sides, masking the larger size of the garment, thus making me appear larger than I would like. The beautiful blue color however is exactly as shown.


Be mindful that the pink is very sheer. (light pink)


I bought two different styles in case one didn't look right on me but both were awesome. This one is perfect for a casual night out with your friends


I want to love this... I really do... Its soo soft,and comfy!! But as a mother, its uncomfortably short. Maybe with leggings in the fall.. but I cant wear it alone.


I wore the dress while flying. It is very comfortable.
