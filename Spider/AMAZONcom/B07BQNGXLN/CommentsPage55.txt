Hangs nice. Very comfortable. Easy to dress it up with accessories or leave it casual.


Nice casual tee shirt dress is easy to wear. I got the dark green color but I actually would call it a teal color, a pretty shade of blue-green. The fabric is on the thin side so it will be nice for summer and late spring. For fall and winter wear, I don't think it will work as well.


I am on the short side so the length hit me just at my knees and for me, that was perfect. The sleeve length was fine, midway between the shoulder and elbow. The description says the dress is made of cotton but there is some other stretchy fiber in there. I have not yet laundered the dress but the directions say to wash in cool water with no bleach, and do not dry in the clothes dryer but hang dry it. Press with an iron at low heat if needed. Easy enough to do.


The dress is a handy little number and for the price, a good deal. I am pleased enough with the dress that I have ordered another couple in different colors. Happy summer to me.


This is a great little dress, fit well, nice material andcolor at agreat price.  You can dress it up with a cover up or wear it alone for a great look either way, I plan to buy a few more in different colors


not very happy with fit


Very light and comfortable. Happy with this purchase.


The dress fit as expected but the material is quite thin. I might be comfortable with it as a beach coverup.


Gray tee shirt dress.


Love it for an everyday wear type dress.


Wish it came in v-neck


Too small through bust. Liked the color and weight.


I sized down and got a medium. I’m 5’4 around 163, I wanted it to be more fitted and the medium fits perfectly. Love the material! Will be ordering more!
