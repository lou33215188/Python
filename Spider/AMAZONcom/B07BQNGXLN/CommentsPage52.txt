I adore this dress! I'm 5'4" and normally a size 14, so I got the XL. It fits perfectly and hits right above the knee. You can dress it up or down, it's honestly perfect for a multitude of occasions.


Love it


I love this dress so much I ordered a second in another color. I'm not usually a dress person, but I've been living in this one. It's incredibly comfortable and really flattering. I've gotten lots of compliments on it. Love!


Perfect fit!


actually a nice fit and not too see through, although i do wear a slip undearneath. the fabric quality is OK--only good enough for 1 season.


I love this dress, I am 5'2 and the length is great, not too short but above the knee. The fabric is very soft and thick enough that it does not require the dress to be worn with leggings. I cant wait to order more in other colors!


Fit as expect. The material was not a cottony fabric like I was expecting. It is silkier and lightweight. I was afraid the silly fabric would cling to places I'd prefer hidden, but it seems fine. I'm not displeased with the fabric, necessarily, it's just not what I was expecting.


Fit well and feels great! The material is really soft and flowy. Can't wait to wear it!


Cute dress! Fits as expected.


Very comfortable dress. I've ordered 3 so far in multiple colors in size Large. Love wearing with a small belt and blazer for work.
