This would be fine is my head was disproportionately small to my body.


cute as can be and as other reviews stated, it has a tendency to wrinkly easily.  Don't let it sway your decision to purchase it though.  I washed mine and hung it dry and its fine.


This dress is great! The color is gorgeous, a must have for red-heads in fall/winter. It's super comfy and perfect with a pair of leggings. Love it!


I really like the dress,just not the way I looked in it!  Cool.  Will try larger size.


Love the dress, but MUCH shorter than I expected. Super-comfortable--feels like you're wearing a long t-shirt. Drapes nicely.


Perfect fit.  Not too short as many dresses this style tend to be.  I am 5'7" and it comes to about 2" above the knee.  Fabric nice and flowy. Don't dry.


I’m 5’6” and it’s a bit short. I wear it over leggings or with a long open cardigan. Soft and comfy. Not see through. Hold up after washing.


Dress fits great, material a little thinner, but not see through.  Can dress it up or down, on a shorter side but appropriate for a party.  Nice color too


The material is very thin, but I always wear a camisole, so it's not an issue. It's longer than I expected as well. It dresses up nicely with jewelry and shoes. It has a nice drape and flow.


I like the color very much. The fabric is soft but thin. I was expecting a little bit heavier fabric (like a T shirt). I will keep it because is very comfortable.
