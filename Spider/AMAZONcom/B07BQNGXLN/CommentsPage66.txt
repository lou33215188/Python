Really cute dress & fun for summer.


Fits fine.


Returned. Too clingy.


The material is soft and flowing. It is very comfortable while being stylish!


Best T-shirt dress Iâ€™ve ever gotten. The cut is really flattering and so soft. Material is A+


I'm normally super skeptical of cheap clothing but this dress is great. Fits true to size and has a very flattering shape. Washed once and still looks good - time will tell how it holds up but a great buy for $20!


Ordered for my daughter's first day of high school. She looks pretty and comfortable!


Material was thin and see through


Happy


The fit was incredible. The fabric is so soft and with the looseness of the dress in the right areas, you can hide a bump if needed.  ;)
