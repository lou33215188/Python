I am 4,11" 165 lbs I ordered a large and it fit perfectly! Nothing clings and it's not frompy! Love it!


Good quality for price. Long enough to wear without leggings and soft material


My only complaint is it wrinkles easy


Perfect summer dress to just throw on and go.  As expected, a great deal


Color is off and material is very thin not a great quality dress


Cute and comfy.


I live this dress it fits me perfectly and right above the knee. It's casual and also easy to dress up.


Love this dresses! Love the fabric/material.  I bought a couple but am purchasing more!  They are perfect for casual wear, but can be dressed up more with long necklace and wedges.


Thought it would be cotton. Returned


This dress is the perfect dress!  Dress is up with some jewelry and a cute purse or wear it with white tennis shoes for a more casual look. I'm 5'3 and it hits about an 1 or 2 above my knees. I actually just went and ordered 3 more colors.
