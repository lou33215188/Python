Well I searched through all the reviews because I had a hard time deciding if I was to get a Medium or a Large. I'm 5'3 and struggle. Between 155 and 159. I did purchase the medium and let me tell you I love it!!! Will be getting more:)


This dress did not disappoint. I'm 5'2 and 110 pounds, the small fit me perfectly. Very soft, very comfortable, and not clingy.


I ordered the short sleeve dress in red wine and black. Both are made from thin fabric, are very comfortable to wear, and fit great... fitted (but not too tight) in the arms and bust and flows away from the midsection - gives me an hourglass silhouette, which I love! (For reference, I'm about 5'5"/160 lbs/38C) I give the red dress 5 stars, but unfortunately the black one is practically see-through so I'll be returning it, hence the 3-star review. The picture I'm including shows the black dress hanging in front of a window with natural sunlight - as you can see, it is VERY sheer...


Love love love this dress!! Can be dressed up easily. I'm 5'8 and athletic figure with a tummy. This dress flaunts your figure without being too short or too tight.


This dress is super comfortable! I'm 5'9 and the dress hits a little before my knees. I plan to order more colors soon.


I love this dress! It is very comfortable. I am short only 4'11,  119lbs and the small fits perfectly! Looks good with or without leggings


Super comfortable and decent quality fabric. I am 5'9" and 138 ponds and a small fits perfectly.  I would order this dress again.


Received the wrong dress wasn't even short sleeve and for some odd reason it has a back train? And the back train is so long it's not even funny! I was so exited for this dress but it was such a waste of money.


I really wanted this dress to be great, but it wasn't. Way more Cons than pros.


Pros:


- fits great! (I am DD, 5'-2", 160lbs and I ordered a medium)


- wear it casual or dress it up


Cons:


- black is see through


- pillling all over after the first wear


- threads coming out after second wear


- holes on the sides seams after the third wear


Love it! Good length even though I'm 5'10". Not see-through!
