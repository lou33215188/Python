Love the pink one! Will order more!


Comfortable. A little shorter than I expected but a very nice dress. Purchased two dresses.


super comfortable but a little clingy


Dress fit as expected. It ran slightly large at first and then shrank after first wash to fit just right. Be sure to hang dry to minimize shrinking. Material wrinkles very easily!


Very comfortable


pink looked like a nightgown. Pick another color for a dress. Otherwise a great buy.


Very thin fabric


Love these dresses!


comfy for summer
