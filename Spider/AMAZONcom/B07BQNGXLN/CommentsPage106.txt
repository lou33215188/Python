Material is a bit thin otherwise it's a great dress


Nothing wrong with the dress; lightweight, great for summer and very nice blue color. Unfortunately it was just too small so I have to return it. In all fairness, I'm large busted (42DDD). It might otherwise have fit, so if you're lucky enough to be on the smaller side, go for it. I ordered the XL.


To short but cute


Good product for the price. Fit as expected. Soft and comfortable.


Loved it but it had two holes in it when I recieved it.


Fit great, the dress was exactly what I expected.


Nice quality for great
