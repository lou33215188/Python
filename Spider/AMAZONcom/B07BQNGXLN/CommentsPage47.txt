So soft and comfortable.


Super comfortable and pretty. Ordered another in a different color


good fit, very thin, had a small hole in it when I receive it, and very wrinkly upon receiving.  I loved the color and fit though, and may order another color.


Great, simple dress.  Soft material, very comfortable.  It's light weight so can be worn as is or in colder weather I will be wearing it with leggings and a cardigan.


This dress is perfect to throw on in a hurry and still look pulled together. I'm 5'10 so sometimes things can be short on me, this dress isn't too short at all! comfortable and adorable!


Love this dress! I was hesitant to buy a medium, as I’m a 12-14, 155 lbs and 5’1, but the medium fit perfectly! Not too clingy, but clingy enough to actually have some shape to it. I love it! I will be buying more colors for SURE!!


Absolutely loved this dress, it's cute and can be dressed up or down


Love it so comfortable perfect for summer bought 2


Too short for work. Didn't like the way the pockets made it flare more.


Fits great, good material, well-made.
