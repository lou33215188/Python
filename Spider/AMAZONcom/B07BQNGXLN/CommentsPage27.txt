I have multiples of these in different colors! They have long sleeves too!


I love this dress I get so many complements when  I wear it. It is a little shorter than what I normally wear. I would defiantly recommend this dress to anyone looking for a cute causal dress. I put a belt with it and I am ready to go.


I love this dress so much I bought it in three different colors. I pair it with some leggings and it makes the perfect comfy outfit. I was a little nervous because my chest measurements go above the xl recommendations, but the fabric is perfectly roomy. Itâ€™s not too tight yet still very flattering.


Would like it better if I could throw it in the dryer. It's fine for around the house, which is what I wanted. Very comfortable.


I really loved this casual dress. Perfect for running errands or a casual daytime look. The material was soft and the colour is as pictured and very complimentary to my skin tone. Will definitely recommend to anyone.


it very nice. fits perfectly, i'm 5'0 so its a little long but I was expecting that. Its very well made.


Fits according to the chart. Looks just like the picture. Purchased for a school project (character in a school play)


Personally, I found it rather unflattering. My daughter may get some casual wear from this dress, particularly with leggings.


Love this dress! Flowy but not baggy. The mauve color is so pretty! I'm a size 12, 5'2", 170ish lbs and ordered the XL which fit perfectly.


Love this dress! I actually love the tank version of this dress but this is great to just throw on.
