I am normally a size small in tops and dresses, but I have extra long legs so I decided to order a medium. Best decision!! Fits so perfectly!!


Fits just right!


I like the simplicity of the dress. Not really keen about the material though.


I ordered this dress in the grey and green. I bought them for a family reunion weekend in which the weather would be about 100 degrees. They were perfect in the heat; cool and stylish. I got a few compliments on the look and fit of the dresses. The only complaint I have is that one of them arrived with a hole in the grey shoulder seam but it was an easy fix!


It's a nice comfortable dress for the money, but it was too sheer to wear comfortably and I wondered how it would fare in the laundry. I had to return it.


This is a great dress no wrinkles perfect fits me I'm a size 1618 and I like them on the blue side no lumps no bumps enjoy


Fit is perfect! Super comfortable! I would wear mine everyday if I could ğŸ’• I got the black and it looks great with silver jewelry.


It's a little too long to use as a tunic top but it fits well and looks good.  Seems to be made well.


Super comfy and good quality material.


This dress was longer than I expected, which was great! I am 5'10", and it manages to fit me and look cute without being scandalous. It's really comfortable and light, feels just like wearing a plain t shirt, but looks so much more cute!
