I loved this dress so much I bought another one in Navy Blue. It's perfect for work or weekend and so comfortable. I get compliments on it all the time.


Love this dress! I'm 5'10 and this is a great length.  Plan on ordering more in different colors.


Fit great except for the sleeves. They were almost half sleeves. A little long but I still wore it to the beach. Very soft


See-through. I returned.


Nice material and hangs well. Only complaint is the color is lighter than pictures wish was a little darker maroon. Still good product!


Super cute dress!  Well made and light soft fabric.  I paired this with a large belt with ornate buckle.  Cant beat the price!


Honestly, these  dresses are so comfortable and cute!  I have one in short sleeve (purple), and long sleeve (army green)  they both fit as expected, and while they were wrinkly when I got them I just washed them and hung them and no more wrinkles. Will definitely be purchasing more in the near future!


I don't normally wear dresses, but this is just too cute not to wear! It's very comfortable. And it fit just right. Even on my somewhat bigger body.


The color I ordered was blue but I was sent Washington Huskies purple.. Cute dress . I like the Huskies but not the color of this dress.


I love it and will be ordering more in different colors :) fits true to size in my opinion. Itâ€™s a nice material as well. :)
