Nice dress to wear on date night, or around the house running errands.


Ordered a small.  I'm 5'1" and the length is perfect.  Weight is 135-ish and this dress is very flattering.  Thank heavens there are dresses out there for petite!!!!


Great fit. Colors are true. Material is soft. It washes well, and keeps it's shape.


There's not much I can say about this dress that hasn't already been written. The fabric is great. It fits awesome. Not super clingy. Very comfortable. I plan to get many more!


Super cute dress! It was true to size. I normally wear an XL, am 5â€™8 and roughly 200 pounds. I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly. Super soft and comfy!


Cheap looking and runs very small


Really liked the dress color is perfect, true to picture and fabric is very soft.


great little dress for around the house and erands


It runs a size too big. So if you are usually a large get a med. I still gave five stars cause its super cute.


Very cozy, fit as expected, perfect easy-breezy dress! I feel so comfortable wearing it!
