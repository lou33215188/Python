Love it! I am 5' tall and it hit me at the knees. I can dress it up or dress it down.


I lived in this dress all summer last year! Walked all over town, shopped, lounged, you name it!


It's super comfortable.


I'm a pant size 12 and 175 lbs I ordered large and it is prefect.


Great littit.casual dress for the price. I'm 5' tall, and it comes to the top of my knees. Might need a  half slip under it.


Feels nice, great material and fit..


This is awesome!! This top/dress is stunning! It goes very well with leggings, and looks exactly like name brand styles. It does run a little small, so I would just size up. I also washed mine and it didn't fade at all. I did not put it into the dryer, though. I would highly recommend this product!


Very comfortable dress, great colour and fit


I love love love this dress.  It is a comfy, casual dress that I can just throw on and leave, and most importantly, it doesn't look like a moo moo, lol.


Great color and soft to touch but  thin material.  I shared my disappointment with seller and was very pleased with the proactive action taken.  You can never go wrong with a seller that stands behind its product!!


This product fit ok, but was a little too short for me!


Good fit
