My wife loves the fit of this dress! It's exactly what she was looking for.


I bought it in 2 more colors after it arrived!  I wore it all summer.  It is the perfect travel dress.


Great dress but there was a hole in it. Guess it will be a night gown now.


Loose, comfortable and cute. It's much longer than it looks--medium hits mid to lower thigh and I'm 5'7"


Pretty short dress


It's very comfortable and would look very nice if I had 20# gone.


The color was beautiful, but this was too small and the fabric is not at all forgiving.


Love


Im 5'4 145lbs and I ordered a Large. I like for things to be a little loose and it fit like I hoped it would.


Really simple and cute!
