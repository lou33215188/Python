The description says the material is cotton, but it is not. In fact, the tags don't even say what the fabric is. I am returning it.


I like it. I had to make some adjustments to make it more flattering as the fabric was not what I was expecting. I felt like I was swimming in it, so I took out the scissors and the sewing machine and made a more flattering approach. :)


I'm updating my original rating and although I originally loved this dress it really is too sheer. Plus my fianc√© noticed that one side was longer than the other in the back. I'm so happy with the black one I ordered but this one not so much.


I am so amazed, this is exactly what I was looking for. I purchased the dress to be loose without looking like a sack and to wear Capri leggings under it. The dress is perfect. Very comfortable and fashionable for a 64-65 young woman.


I love this dress. The fabric is a little thin and in strong sun, I need to wear an underslip. I'm a size US 14 and the large fits perfectly. I'm "pear" shaped and the flare is at the right place to not accentuate my hips.


I guess it's cute. It fits weird and tight around my boobs and arms... so if you're like me and have bigger boobs and broad shoulders, don't buy it. But I could see how it may be cute on a different body type.


I got this dress to wear when visiting job sites. It is super lightweight and looks nice for wearing in the office too. Perfect color.


Before I found this dress, I had ordered several others from various places. Now my searching is over and I'm about to order another one.


Great dress! Was unsure of my size, but I'm very happy with it! It's obviously a t-shirt dress, so it won't be form-fitting. I love the softness of the fabric and how stretchy it is.


Too long, too large and the neck too high: I look like a pregnant nun!


fyi I'm 5'3", 120lb and i got size Medium


I'm thoroughly impressed uth he quality and how well it fits.
