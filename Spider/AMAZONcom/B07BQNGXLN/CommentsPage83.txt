Live this dress. Go casual with a pr of boots or add a belt and heels


Material is thin but comfortable


It is very thin and I would have sent it back because I can't wear it out in public.  I did however need a nightgown.


Dress is light and prone to fly up in a windy situation.. but REALLY comfy and pretty


Love this dress! It is so soft, and has good material! You can dress up or down. It is comfy too!!!


I'm not really a dress person, but I absolutely love this dress! It is super comfy and fits amazing. I bought it green, black, and brown. Would definitely recommend this.


This dress is awesome. Fits great, and can go from work to play with a little dressing up or dressing down. I ordered it in 2 more colors!


Would like a longer length. Dress is good quality and fit


This color is see through.


So comfortable and soft! I'll be buying more colors!
