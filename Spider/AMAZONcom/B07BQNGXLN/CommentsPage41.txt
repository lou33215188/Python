Very comfy. A little clingy but nothing major


The dress was a bit smaller than expected, but I am using it as an incentive to drop a few pounds.  The fabric is a great weight and hangs perfectly.


Fits well looks as expected, but very very thin so I will be returning.


Super soft, colors are perfect.


pleasantly surprised by the fit and look. plan to get more


The dress is true to size,the material is soft and and the cut of the dress makes it very easy to wear. Also the colors are true to the pictures and description. I love these dresses and will buy more.

Cute and comfortable. Bought to use for travel


Cute dress. So comfy and nice fit.


This dress is so comfy and flows nicely. Wear it wth sandals, flip flops or even sneakers. I only gave it four stars because after on e washing on delicate, it started to get those "fuzzies" on it.
