The dress is nice and the color is great, but it doesn't wash well with respect to food


stains.  The fabric seems to want to hold them in.  Other than that, it's a very nice


dress for a casual garment.


Thin material. Doesn't have a tag stating what kind of material.  Very comfortable but not flattering at all, so I just wear it around the house.


Loooove it!!


Exactly what I was looking for. I normally wear a size 14/16 and the xl was perfect!


Literally the only dress out of I've I've purchased on Amazon that I like.


It's a nice dress, with a super comfy flow-y fabric. It has a loose fit as well, which is what I was looking for when I bought the product.


cute but bad materials


Boxy and unflattering


Love the feel of the fabric


My daughter loves that it has pockets but still looks great.
