For the price, this is a great little dress. Easy style for summer and can throw a cardigan over it when it gets cooler. Will order in other colors.


I love the fit of these dresses! I'm 5'6" and around 175 lbs. and the fit is prefect. I purchased a large. The top portion is fitted, just like a tshirt, the rest of the dress is loose through the lower torso, and helps conceal my tummy. Soft fabric, light, but not sheer.


The dress was for my daughter.  She likes the size and feel of the material.  Because she is tall I would have liked to see it a little longer.


Beautiful fabric so soft and the dress hangs lovely on the body.  Just love it!  Going to order another color.


Like I said in the other review... The t shirt dress fit very nicely and my gal loved it.


Not made of best material. Doesn't look like it will last very long.


Cute dress for the summer. Very thin material but not see through thin.


Never got to wear it as it is too small. When I let Molerani know, however, they quickly and graciously refunded my money.


heavier fabric (wore a neon bra under and it wasn't noticeable/visible!), great length, and breathable! I love this dress - I also got it in black!


My high schooler loves it. Comfy and looks great. Long enough to pass the standards for wearing to school.
