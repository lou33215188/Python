Very comfortable for summer wear. The navy blue one I have is great but the pink is a bit sheer. Needs a long camisole.


Fits large. You might consider sizing down.


The material was too clingy and did not look good on me. Maybe it would be better for someone with a perfect figure.


Terrible quality


Super cute! I rolled up the sleeves a touch and wore this with booties, perfect for fall and surprised at the quality considering the price!!


Great soft dress! Can be casual or dressed up.


fits well but the fabric has a bad smell.


Too big. I ordered a M too.


The material is a little thin, but I love how it hangs and the fit is perfect. I'll be buying one or two more!


Perfect size, perfect length.... unfortunately see through
