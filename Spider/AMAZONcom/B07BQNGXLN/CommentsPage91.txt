I ordered a medium and probably could have gone with a small. I'm 5'8 and 150lbs. But it still looks great!


The item came both mildewed and with black spots on it.


loved the relax fit!


Super soft and cute. Wrinkles easily though so don't leave it in the dryer over night!


Love this dress. Have it in red and blue!  Comfortable and you can dress it up or down depending what you want to wear it for!


It fit great, it was a little longer than I expected it to be but that was fine and added to the lax look.


Fit is fine. Fabric is thinner than expected.


Nice color, fabric, laundered well.  Dress fir nicely, I am 5'7' tall, 132 lbs.


Bought it for my daughter and it fit perfect.


Loved it!!! Will definitely buy more... super soft fabric and great price.
