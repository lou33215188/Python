No pockets :(.


I own so many of these dresses I was caught off guard to get one without pockets. But over all the dress is a but thin but very comfortable


Exactly what I wanted. Very comfortable and light. I may buy more of them.


Love this dress, very soft and comfortable and fit great! Not see through!


I love the color but it's longer than expected so I hemmed it up 2" now it above my knees for reference I'm 5' tall 123LBS and I bought a size medium.


Love this dress!  Bought it in green too!  Fits great, washes and dries easily.  Its a summer dress that is cool and comfortable.


Comfy and great with leggings or without. Fits as expected. Very simple, no frills.


Nice color, very comfortable. Fit was good but felt like it shrank in length slightly even after air drying. Would recommend hang drying.


I was scared to place the order but I am sooo glad I did! The dress fits exactly as expected and the material was great. Ordered the red color.


Fit perfectly! I ordered a large (I'm 5'3")  and it fit just fine. Paired it with a colorful cardigan and flats for an anniversary celebration. Easy to wash/dry, stretchy and comfortable material.


Great dress! It fit perfect. I am 5ft and I wear a small. It's flowy but not too much fabric. Sleeves as a great length as they are a little longer.
