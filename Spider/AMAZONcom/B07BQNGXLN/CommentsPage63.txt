The dress is cute and fits as expected. I use a belt with it and wore it on a trip and now to the office on Fridays. Loved it so much I also have the green color.


Not flowing like the picture. Very fitted. Disappointed. I turned it into sleepwear instead of totally wasting my money


Runs a little big but I really love it.


I love this dress so much! I just wish I ordered a Medium instead of a Large. It's soft and a perfect dress for the summer. I got the green to wear with boots for the fall :)


Love the dress


Just a tiny bit short for taller women (I am 5'8) - I definitely can still wear it with no issues. Not see through and looks great for a casual day out and about.


Comfy, thin, very billowy


This dress is my go to outfit.  I love it.


Great summer dress!


Loved the dress but it ran small.
