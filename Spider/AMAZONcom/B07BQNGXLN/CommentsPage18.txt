Beautiful fit and color. I love the feel of the fabric. The dress really looks nice enough for work, day, and evening with a jacket.


Very comfortable and super cute! The army green color is really nice and he cotton is really soft. Perfect for a comfy summer dress.


Very comfortable material.  I like the way that it fit my body especially since I just had a baby and trying to not have my clothes as fitted but still feel sexy. I definitely recommend for the price.


Read all the reviews on this dress before picking a size. I got a medium and it fits perfect! I’m 5’7 and 135lbs. Great quality and really nice material that isn’t see through. I’ll be buying more in other colors for sure!


Cute, simple and fits well. HOWEVER, after about wearing it 5 times and one wash, the dress is already pilling and I don't really want to wear it anymore. The way it sits my also shows underwear and bra lines very easily.


I have now bought several of these for my granddaughter. They are a great buy! They look good, layer well, pack very compactly, wash and dry easily and come in some super colors.


Great as a tunic! I am 5’10” and this provided enough coverage with leggings but I don’t think I’d be comfortable wearing it as a dress- too short.


I was disappointed with how sheer this dress was. I was hoping this would be a staple for the summer, but this isn't going to be it. I ended up returning it. The fit is great though! True to size.


I am not sure what I was expecting when I ordered a light colored dress lol. You can see through it so you have to wear a slip. But the material is soft and the color is very pretty.


Soft!!  Great length for me!  I'm 5'1 and it hits right above the knees.  I ordered a medium and it definitely accommodates my 36ddd chest.  Stretches to fit up top without fabric looking sheer!
