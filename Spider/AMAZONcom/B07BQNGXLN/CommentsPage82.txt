LOVE it! Fits perfectly, AND small is an appropriate length! Don't have to worry about it flying up, and is perfect for work. Very soft comfy material. I will be purchasing again!


Cute and comfortable!


comfy but not flattering


I love it! Super comfortable, and fit as expected.


I don't look like the model that is wearing this dress but it fits to me for my expectations.


Great fit for me. Love the fabric feel. Like the way it doesn't wrinkle while traveling.


Corto y estrecho


For great. Was a little see through but wore a black undershirt and it was fine.


Soft, comfy, & fit as expected


Nice quality.
