Love it


Very comfortable


Comfortable


I never ever write reviews, but this dress is amazing!! So so comfy


I bought the dark red one


Like wearing a hug


Makes you look like you put effort into yourself even though you just threw it on


Love it!


Definitely buying it in more colors


Love this dress!! Wore it for the first time yesterday and got a LOT of compliments. It's not too loose to where you would have to grab it if it's windy out, but it's also not fitted. I plan on buying more in the other colors.


Fits great, true to size. If you are between sizes size down. Fit is loose as intended- use logic and size down or up depending on how you want to fit. Good buy-very comfy. This is not a fancy dress. It's a tshirt/jersey style dress.


Much too long.  I'd planned to wear over leggings, but it fits more as a dress.  I wanted more of a tunic top.  I'm 5'4" and it hit me about 2" above my knees.  Returned.


This is a fave.  Snug around shoulders and long.  Shows your shape but a better version!  I bought the grey and it looks great with black tights.  Add a scarf or necklace!
