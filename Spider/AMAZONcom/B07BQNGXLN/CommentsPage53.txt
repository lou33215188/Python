simple Tshirt dress -  dress up or casual.  very comfortable


Beautiful dress! I know ordered 3 more in different colors. Very nice for an everyday look


nice,a little short


Love this tunic! Looks great with leggings.


Comfortable


I am 5.7 and 190 a large fits perfectly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's thin. But a slip can fix that. Overall I love it! Great for the summer.


Great quality for the price. Fit as expected and is really comfortable.


Material is not nice . also , it is somewhat large from what I expected


Cute, but fit larger than expected.


Extremely comfortable, fabric is light and flowy. Only negative - after washing less than 5 times, the seams at the bottom of the dress are starting to unravel :(
