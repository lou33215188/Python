The dress fits me just like the model in the picture.  It's perfect and the style is exactly what I expected.  I always check seams and hems and this is a very good quality product.  The packaging for shipping was excellent and protected the dress very well.  I am very happy with my purchase.


Great fit. I'm 5'7, 195, 40C, Size 14 pants and the XL is perfect. I'm always nervous that my middle will show but this dress hides it well!


Love this dress!! Ordered a small and it fit perfect. I am glad I ordered a black and wine colored one. Can be casual or you can dress it up. Totally pleased.


Love this - its so comfortable and well made.  Great product.  Glad I bought it and need to buy more.


Easy to wear casual T shirt dress fits as expected and is very comfortable.


I love the dress just up size one size. I wear 10/12 but needed an extra large!


Purchased it in black. Slightly fitted top....nice flattering swing around hem. Very Cute!


Will buy another one.


Shrunk after first wash. Disappointed. But was super cute for the first wear!


Very cute! But it would be a lot cuter if I wasn't a fatty. This dress is one of those things where you can see every line and crease in your underwear and bra and every fat roll and every bit of cellulite. You have to wear a completely smooth bra under it. Although that's really my own flaw, not the dress's. I'm thinking about cutting the bottom off and making into a shirt to tuck into high wasted pants or a skirt. It'll be better that way.
