Soft fabric, and the color is consistent with the picture. The fit is pretty shapeless but I bought as a maternity dress, so it looks nice with a below bust belt.


Bought this dress as a last minute outfit change for family photos. - I love it. it's cute, soft, comfy, flows in the wind, and you can't beat the price. I would buy it again.


Looks like a very casual cheap T-shirt, meaning even though it’s a dress, because of the cut, it looks like you’re wearing pajamas. I wear it as pajamas now.


Fabric is very sheer.


Disproportionately tight in the arms. Material feels pretty flimsy. The cut of the neck is weird — not as cute as the picture.


Love this dress!!! The fabric is so soft and much better quality than I was expecting. It flows nicely. The first day I wore it I got so many compliments! The fit is a nice length too. Goes almost to my knees. I'm 5'5" 130 pounds. I purchased a Small. Fits so well!


Fits great the fabric is very comfortable and breathable. Great for warm weather wear, and easy and light to pack for a trip without taking up room and weight


I love this dress. Wore it with high black boots that came under the knee & received a lot of compliments.


I wish this were a little longer, but it's still just fine. Nice material (not see-through), I'll probably buy in other colors.


Fits great,  however very thin material and see thru
