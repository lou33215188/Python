Love this dress. I have 4 colors now. Very flattering.


I love these dresses! It fits well and is very comfy.


The fabric is very lightweight, and soft. You will probably want to hand wash (it dries easily over night), and wear a slip underneath. It is extremely comfortable. I am 5'4", busty, about 155 lbs.; the size Large fits me. The hem lands a couple of inches above the knee. The overall feeling is relaxed and casual, but could be dressed up a little with office shoes, nylons, and a cardigan. I'm not convinced it will last for more than one season, but for the price, comfort, and simplicity of throwing on and walking out the door in the morning, it's worth it.


Material is a bit thin, but comfortable


Ordered this for my daughter dance recital, fit her perfectly. So if you use the size chart it's pretty accurate. Very pleased.


Comfy--good fit.


I usually wear an XL top. This is great.


I bought the dark green dress. Great color and the material is so soft.


Love the fit, super comfortable!


I love the dress. The neckline is bad quality, but everything else was successful


So comfortable, it feels like I'm wearing nothing!! A teensy bit shorter than I'd like.....BUT still, love it so much that I went back and ordered another!
