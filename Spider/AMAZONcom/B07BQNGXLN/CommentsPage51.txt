I bought a size smaller than my normal size and it fits perfectly. I can wear it with a dress or with leggings, it's cute either way.


Terrible odor of chemicals and had to return. Could not even try on. Awful!!


Super cute and super comfortable dress! It does not cling onto to you, but is not baggy either. Easy to either dress up or dress down. I bought another because it was so comfortable!


This dress does not fit or look like it does in the photo. Sleeves are much tighter than they are in the photo and are not cuffed. Very disappointed.


Purchased for my daughter fit her perfectly. Also delivered when they said it would


Very cool and comfy for summer.


Shorter than I expected. Daring for a 73 year oldğŸ˜Š


Just thick enough to not be see-through. The top part is definitely a t-shirt style, but the skirt comes out in a way that definitely makes this dress more suitable for the workplace. I like how loose and comfortable it is- perfect for the summer!


Nice


Wonderfully comfortable.  I love the fabric.
