It's a cute dress- a little shapeless, but that's what it is. I've already written it 10 times. The only problem is the fabric is pilling. But, it didn't cost too much, so I'm happy.


I liked this so much after I got my first one i ordered two more! Super soft material, washes well. Can't wait to get more! I ordered a small and I'm 5'3 and with a cute knot on the side, its perfect!


Wonderful little dress! I'm going to buy another color. I am 5' 7", 165 lbs and I should have gone with an XL. The large fits, but more as a tunic than a dress. Still, fabric is very comfortable; my new favorite garment.


This dress is my new favorite. I felt really cute in it, and will definitely get other colors. It's really soft, and loose, comfortable. I'm 5'7" around 135/140 and a small was perfect.


This is my second dress. I LOVE them. Fit great, cozy, and can be dressed up or down. Perfect for work with leggings. Will buy in more colors.


These are great quality! Kind of drapey material and the fit/quality is perfect! We bought several colors! So cute with little sandals or the girls wear them with their Converse. Comfortable and easy to dress up or down.


Cheap material wore out and frayed after several uses


Really cute and comfortable. Long enough to wear as a dress or with leggings. The only problem is that the fabric is really sheer, at least on the pink dress (I don't know about any of the other colors). Even a taupe or pink bra and undies are very noticable. A slip and/or camisole recommended.


This dress was a nice addition to easy & simple summer dresses in my closet and doesn't break the bank. The fabric is somewhat clingy, so be prepared to show every lump/bump (or not if you're lucky!) or get those bodyshapers out!


It fit just right! I am 5'0 about 150 lbs and the medium dress fit me perfectly. It gave me a nice figure and looks great on anyone!
