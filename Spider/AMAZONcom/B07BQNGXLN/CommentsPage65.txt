This dress is perfection. Love the army green color and the fabric flows really nice and is so soft. Can be dressed up or down. Worth every penny!


I am 5"3 and 130lbs and a medium is perfect! Love it!!


Soft & cool. I bought a medium and it falls very nicely. Normally I take a large but one size down and fits great.


Wasn't what I expected.


soft material and long enough for me. I'm 5'7 and 147lbs. l suggest buying a small.


Fits great and looks very cute!


Loved this! I bought it expecting it to feel a bit cheap or thin, but it’s SO comfy and not see-through at all! I’ll definitely order in more colors.


The fitting was good, but the model on display is tall, and model whi is actually wearing it is short. While its a good fit, its too long, so maybe offering petite sizes.


Flimsy


Freaking love this dress, so much that I bought 3 of them! They are super comfy & breathe easy!
