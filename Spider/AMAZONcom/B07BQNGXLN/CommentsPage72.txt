Much shorter than expected so I had to return it. Also, material was pretty thin...


not small in a bad way. the material is stretchy.  however, I also purchased another dress by this brand in the same size, and the other dress is slightly larger.


love this --  comfortable fit..


Love this dress!! Great quality for the price, exactly what I was expecting. Love it so much had to get it in another color!


This dress is comfortable and fun to wear.  Great for California sun....


Gorgeous!


Very poor quality


Great fit and great material. The material is a great weight that is not thin at all and very comfortable. True to fit sizing.


A nice dress for around the house.


Great. True to size.
