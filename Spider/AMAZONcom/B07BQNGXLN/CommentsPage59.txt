Fits great! but i won't be putting it in the dryer anytime.


great fit


Dress is very cute.  Great fit;  it hangs loose enough to hide any problem areas.  The material is very soft and comfortable.  I am very happy with this dress and would consider buying it in other colors.  Great price, great fit and very comfortable to wear.


I would give the fit and comfort 5 stars but 2 of the 5 dresses have some fabric discoloring.


Plan on buying one in every color.


Small on the arms


I Like it!
