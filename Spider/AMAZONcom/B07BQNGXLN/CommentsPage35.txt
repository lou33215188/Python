It was a bit too big and I wanted to return it.  Molerani just said keep it and gave me a full refund. Very nice


Really great dress. I wore it once and immediately bought two other colors. The fabric is soft and not see-through. The neckline is very comfortable and the length is modest for wearing at work.


love this dress, wear it all the time! copy.


This dress is soft and comfortable I had to buy another one!  I absolutely love it.


Very pretty and comfy. It is a little above my knee but for the summer months works well.


Nothing special. Most casual of dresses, so there is not much to impress


Very comfortable breatheable materia, perfect for casual wear to the beach or the park or you can dress it up as well.


Simple everyday dress.  Easy to wear.  Soft material.  Well made.  My granddaughter loves it.


I like the shirt but the light pink color requires that I wear an undershirt.


Love these dresses!!! So light and comfortable.  True to t-shirt size.  I ordered 3!
