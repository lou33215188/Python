Love this dress! Fits great and the fabric is so soft and comfy! Love it! Would definitely order more in other colors-great buy! I wore mine with leggings.


Runs a bit large. Really light and comfy material. Perfect to throw over a bikini.


This dress is perfect!  It's casual but can probably be dressed up with some wedges and jewelry.  I got a large and I'm 145 lbs, 5'5".  I got the navy blue and I'll probably get more colors so I can wear it every day this summer.


Love it. Bought in multiple colors. So comfy but cute.


Very comfortable dress. Can be paired with a


Cardigan or jean jacket and some wedges. Able to wear in office setting. Bought multiple colors.


Great dress! Will buy more in other colors. Can dress it up or down.


I'm 5'4" and this dress is longer than I thought it would be...


Love this dress. Will be buying more for sure


Comfy as can be, I have several in many colors.


So comfy and cute! Lightweight but not see through. great for summer. I'm 5'5", 131 lbs, 32DD, athletic build, and a medium is great. Long enough to be comfortable (I don't like short dresses).
