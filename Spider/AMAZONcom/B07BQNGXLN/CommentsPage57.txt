very  comfortable , love the color.


I'm usually a large and an XL fits tightly. Great price & material, just order a larger size than normal


Perfect t shirt dress, not too thin, length perfect for the office. Can dress up or wear with sneakers.


Love the dress


This dress is great, especially for the price! I really like the fit, it's not too baggy, but not too close cut.


I like this dress a lot.


Great little casual black dress - love it!


My new favorite dress!!! Fit like a normal swing dress. Down side no pockets, but I still LOVE!!!!


This dress is super soft and light. The color is just as vibrant after it's first wash. If it holds up for a few weeks, I'll probably be back to buy another.
