A little large on me, but okay overall because it is a loose fitting item originally (ordered size small, 5'1'' and 105 lb).A little too long for my height. I can wear it still with a belt. material is very soft and comfortable.


cute dress, soft, very versatile , fits as expected.


I like it other than the fact that it is very long. I put it on and it went farther down than I expected it to go. When I put heels on it looked better though.


Great dress. Perfect for any occasion as you can dress it up or down. Fits perfect. The only issue is that if you wear a long necklace or cross body purse it will rub the material and leave little snags. Otherwise great. I have ordered another already!


Fits great, I bought this when I was about 13 weeks pregnant and its nice and loose fitting. I could still wear it up to the day I delivered.


I like the look of this dress, but the fabric hangs a little too low, making this kind of dwarf me (I'm 4'11" and ordered a medium). Everything else fit true to size as far as bust/looseness but I wasn't wild about it. Unfortunately returning.


Around the chest area, not as loose as picture


This dress is fantastic. It is a swing shape that is very versatile and definitely on trend. The fabric is lightweight but not see through (I got navy) and so soft. I literally wore this to bed after I wore it out. I am actually back for another color today.


roomy fit, nice fabric; great for casual wear, would recommend!


I like the color, very comfortable to wear, but it's made of cheap material. I am short 4"11 but the dress still short above my knee. It would be nice if it's at my knee length or a little bit lower.


But other than that. It works fine. I will just wear at home as my duster.
