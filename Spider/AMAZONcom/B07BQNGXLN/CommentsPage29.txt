Love the color, but it's a bit snug across the bust.  I'll keep it, but would prefer a looser fit.


I love these type of dresses. This one however I did not. Something about the sleeves, made me look frumpy.


Runs about 1 size too small but is a great product, comfortable.


The fabric is super soft and cmfortable.  Love the way it fits!


Soft and comfortable. I mostly hike in this dress. I washed my over a dozen times and it it still holding up.


Amazing shirt dress!  I have used it as a swim suit cover up and also as a casual errand running dress this summer. I've ordered it in other colors since it's such an affordable and cute dress! Only downside is that it shouldn't be dried in the dryer.


The dress fits wonderfully and is just the right length.  All is good with the product.


I LOVE this dress. I have Prime so it came in at a great rate of speed. I have been looking for a loose fitting, t-shirt style dress and I am so glad I picked this one. It fit perfectly. I got many compliments. I am 5'6" and 125 pounds and ordered a small. Medium would have been way too big for me. I got the 13-short Sleeve-mauve. Beautiful color and looks exactly like the picture.


Nice


A little clingy, even though it is loose fitting. Visible panty lines!
