Love this dress, the fabric is lightweight, breatheble and really soft. Great quality material for the not so expensive price. Would definitely recommend.


casual,  fun, and comfy - a little short for my taste


Love the style and fits perfect for work.


If you are tall,  Dress is short!


Great material, not clingy, and length just above the knee. I’m 5’3 and 180 and I ordered a large. It fits perfect!


Fit is very comfortable. Love it.


I love this dress. It can be super casual but can also be dressed up.


I love it, cones s little wrinkled, but that's expected.


I love it and I will be ordering more colors!
