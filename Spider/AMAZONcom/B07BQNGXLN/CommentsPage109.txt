Did not like the material at all. Did not take it out of bag. Icky material


really cute and can be dressed up or down with pumps or sneakers.  I wore with bright tights and nude pumps and a long necklace and I felt like a million bucks


I like this dress very much... It looks very nice, I got the Burgundy and I love it


love this dress. perfect to pair with some fun leggings


way too small


Love this dress, it is true to size. It is very cute, true to picture on model. A little thin but love the dress, will be buying another.


This dress is so soft and flowy! It's perfect for summer and fits really well! I am 5'4", 125 pounds, and wear a 34C. It hits right above the knees and feels great on. Will definitely buy more in other colors!


Love this! It's comfortable,perfectly fitted, super soft and flattering.


Can see right through it. Stop selling this amazon


As expected
