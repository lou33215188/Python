Great dress!


Pretty and comfortable, exactly what I was looking for!


The dress is great. Exactly what I expected. Material is soft and I love the burgundy color. Thank you so much.


Love it.  I got the grey but I wish I had another color too.


I normally wear a 6 or 8 and I got the medium.  It is perfect...neither snug nor too baggy


Love this and have in many colors!


Nice dress to hang out at home in.


Was very satisfied with this dress.I am a size 8 and the medium fit perfectly.I liked the shade of pink,it's very light so it's just right on hot days.Have gotten compliments when I have worn if.


The dress is slightly see-through and is quite thin


Very see through Will use for beach cover up
