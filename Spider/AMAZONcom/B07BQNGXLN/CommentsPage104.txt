Very cute and casual


So freaking comfy that I sometimes wear them as pjs


I'm 5'5" and ordered an XL...love the fit and it's very comfortable.  I normally wear an XL and this fits nice, roomy but not huge.  Very soft fabric and drapes nicely.  Length is good, just above knees like in the photo.  I would definitely order again...in fact I might today...more colors!  Great value too, much better price than Agnes and Dora ($50+) for about the same thing.

So comfy!!


I absolutely love this dress...I will be buying more!!!


So far I really like it, really cute with leggings underneath and a sweater over top. I bought one short-sleeved and one long-sleeved and I definitely prefer the short sleeve, probably because it looks better with a sweater over it which keeps it from looking too shapeless.


Comfy dress...a must buy!
