Great little tee shirt dress for the Summer! Fabric is a little thin or I would rate 5 stars.... especially for the price.


Love the material, very soft and comfortable for casual wear.


Great dress - easy to pair with everything!


I just purchased two more of these dresses because I loved the first two so much. The colors are perfect, the fabric is soft, and the quality is great. Highly recommend buying.


Perfect throw-on


Missed window so I guess its mine.


Comfortable dress, great fabric. When I washed it on the gentle cycle however, the neckline lost a bit


Of its shape.


Love it


so soft and fits great!


Love this dress
