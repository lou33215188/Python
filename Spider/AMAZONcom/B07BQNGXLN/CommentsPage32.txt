This dress is too small, too thin, and stained!


Love this dress! So comfy and perfect to throw on for a relaxing summer day. I get compliments every time I wear it. Now I want one in every color!


Love this dress for summer with sandals or a cute pair of tennis shoes.  Fits nicely and washes well.  I find the sleeves a bit tight and shorter than pictured.  But overall nice


Fits great and very cute


Very comfortable for work. Dress it up with accessories. Receive compliments every time I wear this dress.


Love this tunic. It's well made. I wear a L and the L fit me perfectly. This was my second order of this tunic in a different color. Will most likely order again.


Cute and comfortable. I love the color.


If it wasn't so sheer, it would be Awesome! I could see my undies. I can deal with it being a bit larger than expected :)


This is probably perfect for someone shorter than me. I'm 5'10" and I can't bend over in this dress so I have to wear it with leggings. Not great for the summer.


Seriously, I love this dress! I love it so much, I came back and ordered two more. They are super soft and flattering, and I think you can add to them and make them dressier.
