Love this dress...it fit like a dream!  Will be ordering more!!!


I love this dress. I have it in red with long sleeves. The only thing is that it is a little thin, so I might end up wearing it as a cover up or with leggings.


Fits true to size. Comfortable


Very nice fit and very flattering.  The only draw back is, it is too thin and see through.  I will have to wear a slip.


Very cute and soft!


The small was a little too big for me. If you are a small in a junior size expect the small in a women size to be bigger.


:)


Great product.  Super fast shipping.  Fabric is so soft and breezy.

Neckline is kinda odd, but I like this dress.
