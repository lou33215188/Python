Super comfy, I am short so it is down to my knees, but I like the feel of the fabric and the ease of accessorizing!


Soft & comfortable but small size still too large for me. I’m 126lb


Beautiful summer dress.  Prettier than a lot of my more expensive dresses.  I love it.


Gorgeous color and fit!


Love love love this dress. Fits perfect I'm ordering another one


I absolutely love this dress. Bought two of them and they are so soft and comfy. Don’t look cheap at all


Fits like a potato sack.


Nice Material.  Dress is more of a darker Teal.


So comfortable and perfect for a laid back, casual look!
