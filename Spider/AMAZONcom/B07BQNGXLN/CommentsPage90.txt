I'm always nervous to order clothes online, but this fit perfectly. It is so soft and the perfect length to wear with leggings.


This dress is too long and sorta large. I'm 5'0 and I was hoping this dress would fit but it ended up dropping Below my knees


Love this!  Wear it all the time.


Love these dresses! I ordered more!


Fit perfectly - great material!


Great dress. Super comfortable!


Perfect little black dress! Dress it up or down!


Excellent


Just okay.


There are color stains on the dress. I was excited about it, but the quality is it as I expected. I will be returning it.
