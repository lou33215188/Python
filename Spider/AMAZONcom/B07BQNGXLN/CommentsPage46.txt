Realy lightweight and comfortable. Love it.  Runs true to size


I love love love this dress! Planning on ordering in more colors!


It runs a little tight for an extra large.


Cute but shows all imperfections you may have


Need more average body types please


great for in the house cleaning, or sleeping in


Bought size up from normal. Material is light and thin and fits great. Perfect with leggings.


Perfect casual dress.  Fits nicely.  Good value.


It was a little more form fitting than expected!  Still comfortable but had to find a different way to wear it rather than a dress. I probably would recommend a size up if not two.


I ordered a large, and I also have a larger chest. Chest area is form fitted but the rest of it fits as expected. Very comfortable! Would probably order again. I however thought it would be more of a t shirt than such a flowy dress at the bottom, but I like it!
