I have this dress in multiple colors and I absolutely love them all. Great for so many different occasions. For example, I've worn this dress to a casual evening out for drinks with friends, to a graduation party, and to work. Can dress it up very easily with any combination of scarf, jewelry, or heels. Loose at the hips (great for dining out)! Highly recommend.


After I bought this black dress, I read the reviews about the black dress being see through and was really worried.


Thankfully, it's not see through. Any cloth is see through when you drape it over sunlight, but this dress does not show off your underwear at all.


Love this dress! I ordered it to have something casual/cute to wear when I'm feeling lazy. It's very comfy. I'm 5'7" 160 lbs. and I ordered a M & it fit perfectly! It is a little on the short side, but I don't mind that.


I love throw-and-go dresses for work and this one dresses up well with a jean jacket or scarf.  It kind of hangs funny on my frame without the jacket or other accessories, so I don't wear it solo. I'm 5'1" 130 pounds and ordered a medium and I think I will stick with that size.  I feel like a small be a little snug around my belly.  I am considering buying more in other colors.


It was hideous on me. I wanted a relaxed tshirt dress that was also flattering, but the neck line is so high, it wasn't flattering at all.


The dress fit as expected the material is terrible  a defect in the material. The dress came in a ball then wrapped in a plastic bag I would never ever buy from them again


Super super soft. Perfect length. I'm 5'6" and normally wear a 10/12 I ordered a large. This is basically a lularoe Carly in leggings material.


Perfect dress with leggings.  The fit was exactly what I wanted. I ordered up one size than normal because I'm larger busted and for a teeny but more length too, lots of complements with my Capri leggings. It's like wearing PJ's to workğŸ˜‰


This dress is perfect. Fits amazingly for my statue of 5feet. Material is soft and I did put in dryer for about 5 minutes to refresh and get wrinkles out. I wore to church and was perfect. The dress can be dress up or wear out for the day. I would purchase again.


I love this dress and wish it came in many more colors! The fit is perfect and extra comfortable, the length is wonderful too. I'm 5'5" and the medium hits right above my knees. I have no issues at all with this dress!
