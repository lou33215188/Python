Fits exactly as expected. Light weight and extremely comfortable! Will be buying more!


Very comfortable.


Even though the fit in the shoulders was a little snug, I love the dress.  The fabric feels amazing. This dress can be dressed up or worn totally casual.


Comfortable and casual. Great for summer.


Very comfy. Great for traveling.


My daughter loves it!


Great wash and wear dress.  Jammed it in my suitcase and it was ready to wear at my destination.  I'm 5'2 and 150 lbs and size large was perfect fit.


So comfy and perfect to dress up for work and dress down for after work activities!


doesnt look like the picture


Very nice and flattering shape and flow; just a little too clingy to wear out & about, since I have a big tummy. If you don't have that problem, then I highly recommend this cute dress.
