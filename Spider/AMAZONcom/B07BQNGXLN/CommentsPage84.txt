My daughter and I both purchased this dress.  She is a size small and I am a large.  We both love them. They are simple and elegant.  You can dress them up or down.  They also travel well - ours were in the suitcase for 3 days b4 we unpacked and the wrinkles just shook right out.  We have washed each dress a few times now on gentle and laid them flat to dry.  The shape and colors have held up well.  I plan to buy a few more in different colors.


Like the dress.


It is so soft and comfortable.  I will be buying more!


Very thin, flimsy material


Very cute, inexpensive dress!  Can dress down with sandles or up with booties!  Would buy again in another color!


The size chart is correct. The dress remained as expected. The photos match the product.


the fabric is really thin and somewhat transparent (i bought the pink one so maybe darker colors don't have this issue). it's cute and soft, though


I LOVE THIS DRESS. So comfy and could be dressed up/down as needed. Perfect for summer or transition into fall with denim jacket.


long and baggy, just how I like it


Great for the price.
