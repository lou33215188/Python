Love this dress I have bought a few of the colors cause it's so comfortable. I wear it with leggings under to work.


Very cute dress!


Goregous color and nice fit, but the 'silky' fabric shows bra lines, lumps, and bumps. Too bad. I  hate to send it back.


Pretty fabric and soft.  Just fits a little too tight in the top.


Love it


Perfect for summer


Loved the dress and the fit but it was too sheer for me.  Had to return.


Beautiful fit beautiful color!


Love this


The fit on this dress tunic was perfect and true to size. Beautiful color that washes up well. I didn't put it in the dryer but hung to air dry. Going to order other colors for myself and my daughter. Great quality!
