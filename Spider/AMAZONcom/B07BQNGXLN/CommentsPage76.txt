This is just what I was expecting. It fits perfectly. And looks amazing on!


Great fit. Cute dress


Love this dress.  Matter of fact have it on now!!!  Should have probably gotten the small but the medium works


Very flimsey, side seam not sewn all the way..will never wear....


Such an easy cute dress - perfect for my life as a teacher! Got lots of compliments. It's a little bit sheer - I had to fuss with what bra worked best with it - but it's a great staple for my wardrobe.


Love this dress! Its sooo comfy! Very happy with it.


I'm 5'10 and usually wear a large... Its comfy not tight on me at all. Length comes to about mid thigh on me.


Love this dress! So comfortable and the perfect length. I'm probably going to get more colors!


Nice fit. Small seemed a little too big on me but it works.


Super cute dress!


I got lots of compliments on this clean style.
