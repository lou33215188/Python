Great product


It runs HUGE and it's pretty sheer. Poor quality.  Waste of money.


material some what thin but fits as expected


Very cute dress!


So comfortable.  Can't wait to take it on a trip.


Great casual cotton black dress. Fit perfectly with the size I needed, not too short or too tight.


I love the fit of the dress, not binding at the waste.  Comfortable, perfect for summer.


Very pretty


Exactly what I was looking for


Nasty fabric
