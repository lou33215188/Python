Well made! Fit perfect.


Very soft, but knowing rayon it will likely pill and be sensitive to washing. A bit bigger than normal. We shall see!


Great Tee-shirt dress. Material is not too thin or too thick. I really like this dress and and considering buying again. The only problem I had is that it did not turn out to be the same grey as pictured. It's more of a blue-grey, which is fine, but I would have preferred the charcoal grey pictured.

Love it! Great fit!


This is a somewhat large dress, that being said I really love the dress. Just wish it came in an extra small. It's lightweight, super comfortable, so cute!


U love this tee shirt dress!! Got here fast. Should of got a small, next one! I got a med and it's a little big. I'm 5'1 and weigh 133 lbs. I'm going to be ordering more, I got mauve , next navy blue..


Light,soft and comfortable! It flows when moving around so it DOES NOT feel big and shapeless yet is not clingy.


Bought this for my 12 year old.  It's super cute and comfy.  She loves it!


It really is a t-shirt in a dress length.  I  guess I expected a little more structure.
