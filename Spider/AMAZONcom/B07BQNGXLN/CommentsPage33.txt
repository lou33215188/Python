So comfortable! If you are into Lularoe but can't justify paying more than $25 for the quality this is a solid alternative. You can wear it over leggings or alone. You can also dress it up with jewelry or a cardigan.


LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS. The material is soft and flowing. It is just as cute in person as it is in the photo.


I love your dress. I got it in purple and will order the wine soon. I just wish it was a little longer. Otherwise, it would've gotten 5 stars


The material is a little too thin and was hoping it would be better.  But the price was low and sometimes you get that.


Very cute but too tight around waist and chest.  Would love to exchange for the extra large


I purchased this to dress up a pair of leggings to wear to my son's music concert, and I loved it.  I ordered a large, but it had plenty of room and maybe could have ordered a medium.  I added a long chain, and it looked very nice and was so comfortable!


Very see through using it as pjs


This material requires imperfect bodies to wear a slip underneath because it shows every little dimple! You can probably also get away with a size smaller.


Perfect dress to hang around the house with or go out and do errands with. It is Super comfortable and very easy to maintain. Excellent purchase for the price.


Love, Love, Love this dress! It's so cool, comfortable, and easy to wear. I received lots of compliments when I wore it so I ordered a second one!  Highly recommend this dress.
