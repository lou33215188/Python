This dress fit perfectly and it was the first time I ordered clothes online.I'm 5'5 and weight 125 so I ordered a size small (US 4). No alterations needed. I wore it to my Christmas party and received so many compliments.


Horrible dress!!!! Thin gross fabric not shiny and the entire thing is a joke!


The dress on the picture was white but when I received it the color was more off white.  My suggestion would be to make it clear what the color really is before customers make a purchaseI


i big to long, but is lovely


really i do recommended.


my mother loves it, she looks gorgeous. like a dive.


Dress is pretty but I had to get it taken in, it runs a bit large so I had to get it taken in. Came VERY wrinkled, but I was expecting that. Other than those 2 things you can't beat it for the price!


I am going before the Pastor to unite with my fiance, I needed something of my taste yet affordable.  This was a good match.  I love the fabric, and it moves when I walk.  It even has a little train!


It is a fact that for the price you pay is the quality of what you receive. This is not the exception. And nevertheless I think you can impress at any party.


The top was little to thin for me but the dress is very pretty and looks just like the picture..

Also returned this dress


Excellent delivery time. For the price, the dress was of good quality.  I thought I was a size 4 but I had to return for a size 6.


I went by other dresses that I had tried on, bad idea. Use the size chart to find the perfect fit, beautiful dress.
