I really look good on the dress.The fittings was perfect thought the lenght came up a few inches shorter than i would have liked.


Fit perfectly. Got a lot of comments!


The dress fits very nicely, I have small boobs so I had to get it adjusted. Other than that it fits nice, I'm 5'10 and the height is just right.


I received so many complimments when I dressed it.  Very simple but at the same time so elegant.


This was a little bigger than expected


The dress was true to size and well made. The material was not super high quality but it is nice for the price. Very flattering on hour glass figure.


I liked the color and the style, however, it was too small and I had to return it for another dress.


The size was kind of large for me. Also, I would like it to be longer. I had to return the dress.


Perfect


I love how light it is, you can dance all night. It hides the extra skin between your arm and chest. However, if you have a small chest, the V is very deep.
