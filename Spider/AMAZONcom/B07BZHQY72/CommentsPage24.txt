Fits beautifully, and the back is gorgeous! You'd have to wear shapewear underneath though, because it's very thin and a tiny bit sheer.


While this product was a bit smaller around my ribs than anticipated, I did manage to get into it, and it looked and felt fantastic on.


I had to go by the chart because of large breast, but hot damn I look good!  I'm 5'1, 38D and got a size 8.  Curvy and sexy is all I can say.  I love it!!!!!!!


I loved this dress. My only problem with it was breast area, It does not fit as well as I wish it did. overall dress is made nicely.  I am size 2-4 and I ordered appropriate size, but it ran small so I had to relapse it to size 6.


It was cut a little larger, so I took it to get altered and it fits perfectly.  It is really a beautiful dress!  I wore it to my company Christmas party.


It's nice but if you have lots of boobs , I wouldn't suggest unless you don't mind the girls out....I will wear a low cut bra. It has a shine finish..... Overall its affordable and I am pleased


It was a bit big in the bust but otherwise was perfect! The green color was stunning and I got many compliments! It looks very expensive! However, the material is a bit cheap and wrinkles very easily so I recommend getting it steamed.


It was too short!  The train could have made it appear to be the right length but I didn't feel confident in it overall.  sent it back.


For the price I paid it's ok. The fabric does look cheap, but with good accessories it's gonna look fine. I'am 5.5" and it does not cover my feet and the front. It's longer on the back.


I love this dress. I had to have the top altered as it fits larger than the rest of the dress. If you are not a busty person this dress may not work for you. It is very elegant yet sexy. I can't wait for our party now.
