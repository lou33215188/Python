It wouldn't zip in the bust area. I usually wear a 6 and this was an 8. It's hard to order a dress over the Internet.


Worked great for a Carrie Halloween costume.


Love it. Perfect for my wedding day.


Good material, great design, almost perfect fit, I am somewhere between size 6 and 8, bought an 8 and needed slight adjusments. It had great impact at the event I was wearing it. Simple and effective!


Loved! Wore this to my 2014 Prom :)


Love the quality.. love the dress.. however it was too big I DID USE THE MEASUREMENTS AS WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE DRESS SIZE CHART.


Straps were a half inch too long, otherwise perfect to size.


I had to return the dress. I am still waiting for the size under.


Love it!!!


Fits as it should.
