this product is excellent... so good... i love it, recomended confort. Durability. Quality and Design. Conformance, just that i find it


Just as pictured


Beautiful dress and especially well-made for the price. Best for smaller breasts, however. I am a size D and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to wear this without some bra or corset showing.


The dress was bought for a gift. I am not sure about how she liked it but I did! Just that!


I like the price, the color is nice.


The dress fit but I didn't love the dress on me! Sizing is true to measurements! I am top heavy and it wasn't flattering for me personally, but the dress was absolutely stunning!!! I would def order from this company again!! Shipping was crazy fast...I rcvd the dress in 2 days!!!


fabric  was different than what it was described and i expected....i returned it immediately the same day...I loved the color and the back design..but that's just about it...


the dress was just a little bit too small but I love it and I'm going to get it fixed to wear.


This dress looks good on the model, but when yu get the dress the part that goes around your arm is too long.  The breast part is too small and the back hangs instead of fitting snug like on the model.  Buyer Beware!


This dress is stunning for this price!
