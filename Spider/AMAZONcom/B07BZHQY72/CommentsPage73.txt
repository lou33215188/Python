Really a beautiful dress.  Going to be wearing it as bridesmaid dress but for sure will be able to wear again.


I like this dress it was just to want it thank you for your service and I love it too much


Great dress


not true to size I looked at the chart and measurements. its not a true fit wouldn't buy again sorry


The bust is made waaay too big. Couldn't wear it because I did not have time to get it altered.


i love it. i had to have a few alterations done on it but in the end it will be perfect. thank u.


The dress looks good. Material and color as expected. On me, this dress did not feel comfortable (size 14) .


Top was very loose and material was more sheer than expected.


Fits just as it is described.  The fabric is beautiful, the fit is sexy.  I normally wear a dress size 10, but according to my measurements on here, it suggested ordering a size 8.  I risked it and did, and it fit absolutely perfectly.  I got so many compliments when I wore it out that it was probably one of the best dress purchases I've ever made!  And at a fraction of the cost.  I did have to iron it when I received it, but that was to be expected for about any online clothing purchase.


love it !!! so pretty and elegant ! i didn't expect the dress to fit so well nor be so pretty .
