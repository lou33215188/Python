The fabric has very low quality.


I bought this dress for the Marine Corps Ball. The dress fits as expected if you follow their sizing chart. I am 5'8 and the length is perfect. The material does not look cheap. The only warning is it might be hard to find a bra. Its pretty low cut in the front, the sides are low, and the back is definitely impossible. There is no cups and very thin lining on the dress itself. I think I am going to look into getting a deep plunge convertible bra.


great dress. great buy!!!


Very pretty dress; too large in chest area and way too long.


had to alter most of it as the chest was to small, the waist and the length. too much adjustment for 1 dress.


I ordered another one in red because I loved the black one and the price was right. Now I'm ready for a party


Love the look dress. The material is cheap and the zipper is horrible. I felt it should have been snug in the breast to hold them up. Big or small


The fabric of the dress is the cheapest ... very different from what is shown in the photo.


Do not like the quality


Pretty dress that fit great. Simple but elegant.
