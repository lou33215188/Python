It was a success! I had friends contacting me the next day to borrow the dress! The package that the dress arrived was just a plain paper envelope and I believe it could be better.


I bought this for a friends wedding, not only did it not fit but it was extremely wrinkled i was very disappointed. It concept it was very pretty but nothing at all like i thought it would be


This dress is pretty but the material was very cheap. I decided to give it a try for prom and it was disappointing. The satin was very cheap. Not my type of gown.


Very flattering dress. Somewhat slim cut, works well with curvy figure. Beautiful forest green color. The fabric is polyester and looks like a lighter weight satin. Very good value. I really like it!


This dress will not work unless you have a perky chest. I'm a b cup but not quite perky. I should have listened to the other reviews.


It's a mix.  The rib area is a bit tight (I'm afraid to raise my arms) and the length is a bit long.  I require a seamstress.


gave it away to a prom/graduating program to get girls dresses they cant afford. i hope it makes someone happy


Love it! Beautiful and comfortable.  The red one is amazing!  Excellent choice for the price. I would definetely buy again.


I am very impressed with this dress. It fits perfect and is well made. You cant bet the price. Bought it for my sister's wedding and I am happy with purchase.


This dress was so cheap, I took a chance and bought it and was amazed that it was so beautiful and looked great on. It was a little big in the chest but totally worth it to have that altered. Great purchase overall.
