Pretty color and material, but this dress runs really small.


Mmmm


The dress is beautiull but is very large.


I will try to fix it.


I received it at time. The transaction was OK.


I love it.


Was beautiful and smooth a little long so heels if you're 5'4 like me I got a size 10 I'm a size eight normally. 155 pounds and size 36C.


Love it


the dress does not look like the picture.  the size is deceiving.  I will be send it back for a full refund.


Perfect for a student budget, and the material is good! Had to get the bust altered, but I have an athletic body, therefore no boobs.


The size chart was exact an it fits Perfect no need for any alterations. The right color as described Received earlier than suggested


Dress fits perfectly. It is light and perfect for my July wedding. My little cousin is going to look amazing in it
