The dress was well made and good fabric the top was a little to big in the chest but I will just have it tailored other than that I love it got it for a wedding and can't wait to wear it


Dress is beautiful but stitching around the shoulders is bad.


It fit good in general but the top is VERY loose. I am a 36c and it was still very exposing. I would recommend having it tailored on top because it's too complicated to safety pin.


love it!


The dress was beautiful and was perfect for the occasion!  It came very quickly too.  The top of the dress (chest and sides under armpit) were a bit big, but it still worked well and will not take much to alter!  It is a classic dress and would definitely buy it again.


When the dress arrived, I was so amazed on how pretty it was. It will work great for my evening out. I will most definitely order from this company again. The dress was a tad small, so I ordered a size up. But other than that, this dress is a winner. LOVE IT!! It is so pretty and classy.


This dress is absolutely stunning. I'm 5'3" with measurements of 36,31,39.5 and I ordered a 10. It fits perfectly. It is a bit big in the bust area, but a small alteration can fix that. Definitely would recommend!!


I was very surprised by the quality for only $48. It for nice, I ordered the pink and was afraid it would be too light, it is a perfect ballerina pink. Very happy with this purchase.


It came in a tiney box, was worried but the Dress was perfect. Had to take it in a bit, but the color was beautiful. Received lots of compliments


My wife loved this she wore it on our anniversary.  It looks great in person as close to the picture as you can get  I would buy from this company again
