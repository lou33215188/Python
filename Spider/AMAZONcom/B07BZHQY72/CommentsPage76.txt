Beautiful dress.


Dress fit okay but it does not have bra, my sister bought it for a wedding and she looked beautiful


Good dress. Specially for what i want it for! Fits very well and it is a quality dress!


I bought a size 16 primarily to make sure the bust would fit me, intending to take in the waist.  I am a 38DD and when I measured my bust line, I fell in the range for the size 16 bust measurement.  Once I tried it on, however, the top hang so loose that there was a good 3-4 inches from where the fullest part of my bust was to where the dress would be filled out and not hanging.  I even tried on a bra that adds 2 cups sizes and it was STILL too big.  I ended up having to spend an extra $65 to take the bust in so the dress would fit me. Even then, the dress was VERY difficult to alter and doesn't sit quite right.  Overall, I am not happy with it and I wish I could return it.  It was a waste of money since I couldn't even wear it to my event due to the bust fitting wrong.  Other than the incorrect bust measurement, though, the dress fits slightly smaller around the waist and wasn't long enough to touch the floor (I am 5'10") even while wearing flats, despite other reviewers saying it was long enough on them.


Why did I waste my money!!!! Grant it, I don't normally buy cheap clothing but needed a white gown in a hurry.


The dress does not fit correctly, was not long enough (am I'm 5'7"). I could not attend the function needless to say...
