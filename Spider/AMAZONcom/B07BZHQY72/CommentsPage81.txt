returned it


didn't fit


Exactly as describe! Love, love, love


Beautiful gown!  I should have ordered a smaller size as the waist was a bit big.  After alteration, it was beautiful!


The size was too small and I actually wear a 7 and the material was cheap it ripped on the day of my event


Gift.


Beautiful dress, great fit. I chose fit as expected because I knew it was going to be a bit long for my height (or lack there of) so except for reducing the length...all around winner.


Cheap.


The dress is beautiful! However the front and sides are extremely low; I had alterations. I'm giving four stars because the dress is a little deceiving.
