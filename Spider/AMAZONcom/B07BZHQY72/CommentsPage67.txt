It was horrible. The dress fits and looks bad. The fabric itself not good I was not pleased at all.


Dress arrived quickly.. Was nice, but not for me.. The top was tight, need to wear some kind of bra with this dress or have a boob job!


I love this dress! It is formal and elegant without the need of too much detail (beads, sequin, or heavy material). Fits as expected.


Great price for a gorgeous well made dress. Elegant and sexy. I love this dress! I bought the black one.


Absolutely STUNNING dress!  You will have to get it dry cleaned to get the wrinkles out as it is satin and will wrinkle like crazy but boy, is it ever worth it!  What a ridiculously sexy dress!!!  Break out the black velvet opera gloves and red soled black velvet shoes!!!  This one's a keeper!


I like the dress. The fabric is nice.


Fast delivery. Better than expected for the price. Very happy.


It was almost perfect it was just a little to big and a little to short for me. I am pretty tall. This dress is absolutely beautiful!


The dress fit well every where but the chest; the zipper was a little of a struggle to zip there. Over all gorgeous dress but on the thin side of fabric.


This dress just made the best ball ever! She was the most beautiful women in the whole room! Antonio Dinkins
