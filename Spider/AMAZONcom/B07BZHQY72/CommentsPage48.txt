I bought this for a friend and she is satisfied with it.


The dress didn't hang right on me.


Sorry wrong size and one breast covering is one size bigger than the other


I purchased this gown for a charity gala.  I stopped counting the number of people asking, "Who are you wearing?"  and "Where did you get that gown?"!  It fit great - it was comfortable, and looked amazing!


So Very Comfortable and Beautiful.


The dress fits perfect even the length was good!!!!!! Great buy, will be buying from this brand again, really loving my dress.


The dress fit well in the waist, but was very large in the chest area


Dress fits as expected, but the zipper is cheap. Struggle to get it past the ruffle section in the middle every time. For the price, can't complain


The dress was somewhat too shiny and to sheer. The bust area would be perfect for someone with bigger breast but I had to get it altered. Other then that it will work


I ordered this dress in a size 8 for a Christmas party.  I love it!!.  I'm 5'11 and weigh 165lbs.  I hope this helps.
