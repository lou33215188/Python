I didn't like the shade of purple but, the dress was nice. It fit a true size 10 and laid nicely.


Nice dress. Great price. Was too big in the bust. Used something to jimmy-rig it so it fit tighter for the evening. No one could tell. It was a hit!


Despite following the size guide the dress was sooooo too bi for me. Sent it back.


Fits like it was made for me.


I love this dress so elegant !!!!!!!!!!!!


It's silk and I didn't realize it was see through...other than that I really like the dress. The top is a little big at the top and bust area.


The fit was awful and the dress was as cheap looking as the price.


Beautiful dress. Love the back. Too long for my 5'3" height so will have to have hemmed. It's an amazing find, especially at this price!


beautiful dress and great material. fit like a glove. I was really happy with my purchase and would buy from this seller in the future.


I really like the dress but it does fit a little too snug. I would purchase from the company again tho knowing what size to get now
