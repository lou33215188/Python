The color was much more dull than it appears in the picture and the material was so thin I might as well have been wearing nothing for the amount of skin and bones that showed through the dress. It is priced cheaply for a reason!


Best online purchase ever!!


Was a great fit!


I bought this for my mom since she was going to a wedding. It was long for her but fit her fine otherwise. Had ti tailored and she loved it.


Love it


Fit like a glove (though no stretch to the fabric) and delivered to my door with in 48hours for under $40. It arrived vaccum-sealed and folded up so required professional pressing before it could be worn. It also had a few very slight snags and upon very close inspection some sort of watermark. Give yourself time to take it to the cleaners before your special day. Also, it is very sheer so go with the flesh tone undergarments. There is no built-in support in the halter and the back is too low for even a convertible bra so tape or support petals are recommended.


I am 5"11 without heels and dress was to short with and without heels. The picture of the dress is not a true picture of the length the dress is higher in the front and longer in the back, so if your tall this might not work for you


I'm no too happy with this purchase.  It looked much better online. I don't recommend this for purchasing by anyone.


I ordered this dress and it arrived 2 days before expected, which is always a plus. Im wearing it for my wedding and Im going to embellish it myself. it fits wonderfully! Thank you!


This dress was amazing. I had a holiday party and wore this dress I was the bell of the ball. I wore a size 8, I'm 147lbs and 5'6, it fit perfect. I'm a C cup so the halter top worked well.


If you get this you will be a happy girl!
