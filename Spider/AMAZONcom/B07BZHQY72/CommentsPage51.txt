When I ordered this dress, I wasn't sure how it would fit. I used the size chart provided by the vendor. When I received the dress, it literally fit perfectly! I am so happy with it. It looks and feels like a $300 dress, but cost less than $50. Yay.


A great evening gown I plan to use for special occasions or events.


very cheap.


Beautiful gown, just slightly loose around the waist. I followed the sizing chart when ordering. It will do and still looks good.


This dress is just what I was looking for.  For the price the quality is exceptional.  Great value.


I love the dress. Besides the fact that I thought just the center was satin, the whole dress is satin. But I still like it, I am going to get some alterations done to the dress, but other than that, I love it!!


Beautiful color. Very Sexy cut. Was a tad small around the rib cage. I wear a 16 and had trouble zipping it up. Its nice and long which i really liked.


The dress is a great value, very pretty. Sadly I had to return it because the bust was too large, at it wasn't flattering to my body type. I think for most people it would be a good purchace


Dress looked awesome!  Unfortunately the fix was a bit akward for me. Too snug in the waist and too loose up top, considering i am a 38d.  Quality of the dress was ok.  Material is very thin. Overall nice dress.


Purchased as a gift and it was well received. Recommended.
