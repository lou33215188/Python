Fabric and cut is nice. Neck line was very revealing. Will need to return


The size chart they tell you to use is not accurate to the dress. Also the material is a little sheer so make room for a slip underneath.


Beautiful color but too big. We are sending it back for a smaller size.


Amazing dress for an amazing price! I love the dress and how it fits. I am short and rather busty, so as with all my dresses I will have to take up the straps. The busty problem will be solved by adding some satin and lace in the middle. It really is made for a small chested woman. Being a 38DD it is a bit too revealing for me. The dress is beautiful, and with free shipping and returns what are you really losing if you try it? Try it you'll love it.


this was a cheap disaster.


If you follow the sizing chart they provide you, it will fit.


Silk like material, flows nicely.


I am 5'8. 34d-26-40 and ordered a size 6 the fit and the length is perfect.


well worth the money.


I love how it was on time amazon itself is the best but I give the dress a 5 out of 10 ...I didn't pay alot for it & when you get the product you can tell.. The material isn't the best..& if you have a bigger chest don't EVEN LOOK AT THIS DRESS


Just too shinny for me.. for some reason it doesnt sit well on my shoulder.. i am small to med size chect... but not my style..


The dress on the model looks amazing!  The actual dress is poorly


made, inferior fabric and the zipper permanently stuck.


This was not a good buy.
