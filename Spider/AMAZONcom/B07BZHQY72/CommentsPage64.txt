Great fit and I love everything about it and you can't go wrong with the price. The dress looks better in person then online and must get


Gorgeous dress for the price.  It fits small, but I was expecting that from reading prior reviews.


I had to contact this vendor to find out when the dress had not been shipped to find out they didn't have it in stock. Very disappointed as if I wouldn't have contacted them, I would have never known they didn't have it and it was for my niece's wedding.


this seller is great the dress fit my daughter in law to a t


Ordered this for an upcoming event, can't wait to wear it...the picture does not do the color justice-it is beautiful!


Fabulous dress.  I did order a size smaller than recommended on the size chart.  I'm glad I did.  With the exception of being a bit long on the arm straps (because I'm 5'1") and long it was great.  A little tailoring to make it fit me perfect will be worth it.  It was a great value and would look good on the 'red carpet'.


Beautiful dress for a great price.  Fit perfectly but I am going to take to the tailor to get the top a bit more fitted to me.


Loved it!


It fit but was really tight, with no give. I loved the dress itself, but decided return the 6 and get an 8.


Loved the dress, just had to make some minor adjustments for it to fit properly.


Its a nice dress for a great price. It looks chic enough and fits well:) i was complimented by everyone!
