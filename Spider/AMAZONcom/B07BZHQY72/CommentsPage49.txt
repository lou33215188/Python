Cute dress! simple and classy! the color is exactly as the one pictured and the price is amazing, I wore it for my sister's wedding and got so many compliments. I highly recommend!


Beautiful dress but runs small.


The dress is okay, it's pretty, it's worth the money, but It's like anything else, you get what you pay for. It's pretty low cut and it's definitely see through, needs under garments for sure! Other than that, it's not a bad dress!


Good quality


I both a size 6 , would of gone a size bigger because I'm 36 C I'm bust size. So my boobs were out a little but it still fit great and elegant. Felt like a queen.


I have a very thin upper body and I barely got the top zipped.  If I go up a size it will be too big. Not totally happy but didn't expect perfection for the cost.


I am so happy that I bought this amazing dress;


It fit just as I expected.


The only adjustment that I had to make was the bust area due to my size but everything else is perfect.


This color is amazing! With a few slight tucks this should be stunning and elegant at a steal of a price!


Too small around the band at the waist which left too much room in the chest area. It was a beautiful dress.


I just shipped this back because i am a tiny girl and this dress was just a bit too large, though i was thrilled with the dress itself, nice material and seemingly well made, i hate being so small!! Anyway, Im sure someone else will love it and look beautiful in it!
