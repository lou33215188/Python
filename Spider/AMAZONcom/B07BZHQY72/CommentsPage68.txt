Love it. The fit is perfect for  true size 6


The top is very large and the bottom is snug, weird sizing


fit was exactly as they said and no issues.


Yes the zipper is sticky but run dry bar soap on it...that is a tip. I am 5ft 9 inches 140 lbs. I will wear spanx if I don't lose five pounds and, as another woman so sagely advised, connect a lace loop to the train and tie it to my wrist. It is for a cruise, so it is light to pack. Will need to be pressed and a stick on bra. For the price it is a great deal...


too much fabric cause damn my boobs aren't that big


This dress looks cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for. The fit seems to run a little small and it is shorter than expected.


Got it in two days as promised.At 5'.7", with a pair of not too high heels the dress was perfectly off the floor for my toes to just peep and still not come in my way when I walked, trail is beautiful and fabric is very nice for this price-gorgeous dress and would have fit perfectly(size8) if the zipper was a better quality. I also found the bust covering to be a bit small, would have preferred a bit more fabric for a full figure.So unfortunately, am returning it but may order another one if they improve the zippers.


The dress was beautiful but didn't fit me and couldn't wear it to my cousin wedding this Saturday that past


It has some gaping on the side of my C breasts, but I plan to fix that with some Hollywood tape. Otherwise it is FANTASTIC! Not cheap or see through! It does "fit as expected" but I went by the measurements chart and bought size 6. In the juniors department, I'm a consistent size 4 at Macy's. If you don't have size D or more, you may want to buy some adhesive push up bra to help out!


Sewing is very low quality. See the seams


I was disappointed.


The dress does not sit well in the chest. Chest seems to fall under that gathering.
