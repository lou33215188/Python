Great dress. A little big on the top part for me tough.  Otherwise very nice and the color was nice too.


I got this dress for a photoshoot,  awesome for the price, fits perfectly. I was very surprised at the quality for the price, also shipped fast.


Dress not made for bustier women


The Dress was a big hit.  What a great price!  Normally Evening Dresses are sized too small by 1 to 2 sizes so remember that when you order.


I should have returned it. Not good quality.


extremadamente grandeeeee..!!!!


Very nice dress of exceptional quality. The zipper is delicate and my not hold up to stress well. All around a good quality dress for the money.


Low quality material.


I love the color and the fit. The color is stunning and it clings in all the right places. Beautiful.


This dress is gorgeous !! Except if you have large breast!! If you do don't order it! The breast part is too small! Other than that it is a  very nice dress!!
