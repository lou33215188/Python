Nice color, slit was too low for me.


very low cut.  actually having trouble finding an undergarment that won't show


Very beatufil!


I bought this dress for sub ball and I needed a dress that was a lot cheaper than I was finding.  It was a little large but that works for me because I had it tailored to fit just right.  It was a pretty dress for the night, and everyone loved it.


I didn't like the fabric, reminded me of a neglig√©e


occasion


This is sheer and does not have a lining or bra pads so be prepared for that. It is GORGEOUS though and I highly recommend it.


The dress is really nice and true to color, but the sizing is off. I took my measurements and got the number size according to that. I got the dress today (super fast shipping) tried it on and the straps were super long and the waist was loose. So now I am going to have to get it altered in order to fit me correctly. But other than sizing chart being wrong, the dress itself is really nice


Arrived fast and fit perfectly!! I can't believe how good this dress looks for the price... It's a steal!


I usually wear a size 2 or 4 but needed a size 8 of this dress. That said, it's pretty and for $38 it's a great deal. I'm 5'9" and it is floor length on me.
