It looked exactly like the picture which I loved but it was somewhat large which was okay. The somewhat large part is a personal issue overall the dress is fantastic!


Dress was impressive for the price. Purchased bigger to fit hips. Need to get the top tailored to fit better. Still love the color and the material.


had to have it taken in a little


So beautifull


It was to large never wore it


Fits as expected.


The dress is pretty and it fit me perfectly through the torso and the fabric is nice, but I had to get the bodice modified.


Great dress for the $  :)


This was a great deal. Great dress, fit to size, nice material. I am a size 6 and about 5"2 the dress fits perfectly.


fit exactly as measurements described, material isnt satin but sure looks like it, winner!!  Highly recommend for anyone looking for evening attire to a party.
