This dress was a great value!  It fit perfect and was such a good price.  The quality is good too.


I love it! the dress was a perfect fit after taking note of the size of my bust and the recommendation on the sizing chart.


Love this dress! Great price! I didn't think the quality was going to be that great because of the price but, I was pleasantly surprised.


The dress itself is great. Was just disappointed by the actual color it was when I received it; ended up way darker than pictured. I got the biggest size and still fit too small! Not made for women with hips at all. What a shame too, it's a gorgeous dress.


Don't get me wrong, this dress was extremely flattering, arrived quickly and was inexpensive.  Looked great for the fundraiser I wore it to. However, it one strap was torn when I received the dress and I had to get someone to fix it for me.  Did not have time to send it back. All in all, a good product for the money.


I bought this dress for a private wedding ceremony and it fits absolutely perfect!!!! When I first saw it I was a little worried that it would be too long (I'm 5'2 135lbs) but the size 6 I ordered fit like a dream, and looks just like the pictures. A few wrinkles, but nothing a steamer couldn't handle. The dress also came very quickly which also impressed me. All in all A GREAT BUY for $40.00


customer service was good. The dress was not great for me and didn't fit well. I'm short so this was for a much much taller person.


I am really pissed off i was sent undwerwear and not a dress  i sent it to my wife and im out of state so its hard to return it with me not veing there


Very nice dress and good quality for price
