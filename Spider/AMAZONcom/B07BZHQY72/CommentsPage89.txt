It is a nice dress, just little to long and lose.


Beautiful dress, decently made. Best for those with smaller breasts (probably US d cup at most) or very perky ones; bras are a no go with how low it is cut!


At first I wasn't sure how it would come worried it wouldn't fit but, now that's it's here it fit like a dream size 12, perfect fit just as the picture...my dream is great and on time...


I have this dress in two colors, and both were perfect!  Did not expect such a great looking dress for the price.  It was super flattering and incredibly comfortable! I may order all the colors!


I really like it, my fiancee actually loved it.


It's not bad for the price, but feels and looks cheaply made which just didn't look right for a formal occasion. If it is for a costume or something it would be great.


Loved the dress, but was sort of small and longer than expected.  However, I am petite and expected it.  The dress is beautiful!


The size match pertectly. Its really beaty and fix like expected. I'm so much happy its so elegant I love it


Everything fit perfect except for the waist area. It was just a little tight


I just have to juice before I use it... But loved the dress.
