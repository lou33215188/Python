It was beautiful. The sides near the arm pits were baggy so I had to pin it.


I am usually and 8/M for casual/stretch clothing and a 10 for formal/non-stretch clothing. I got this dress in 10 and it fits perfectly, no adjustments required. The color (green) is just like the picture.


low quality materials, it must be taped to the model because the dress had no structure to it.  I sent it back.


This dress is awesome fit great looks elegant


I wore a size 10 and it didn't zip. The zipper didn't zip easily. So I took measures into my own hands, dropped 6 pounds for it to zip. I'm curvy so my chest over filled the top, but with good bra it worked out. Definetly not a stretch dress, no room to overeat while wearing this dress. The length was great. The material is nice. I got complimented a lot on this dress. looked good in it, but not fun sit down in.


Very nice dress... looks grear in person.


Got it in red and loved it so much that I had to get the same one in black!


Perfect size and fit


This dress fit like a glove and was a much better quality than I had expected. I bought it to wear to the theatre and it did not disappoint!!


The color is a little darker than it shows online, but I still like it.  It is a little loose in the top, but I also expected that.  Overall it is a beautiful dress for a great price!


The plunge was a little deep. I plan on having it altered.
