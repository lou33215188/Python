So I had to get this dress for a friends wedding. I am 5'2 and my chest is a 34b. The best size for me to get was a six, but I have to get it tailored. It doesn't fit my chest and is way to long for me


I'm 5'11 and this dress wasn't too short for me. This dress really compliments my shape and I'd recommend it to anyone.


Received the dress, smelled a little funny when I opened it. Will need to dry clean immediately. The dress was nice, but the top was very large for me (I'm a 36D), so I will need to have it altered, but overall made well, nice material, for the price and the train is a pretty added touch.


It was large for me but beautiful. I went to a tailor to fix it and after that I love it.


I purchased using the sizing chart.The straps were too long and it was a little big around the rib cage. But nothing that can't be fixed with a little altering. I probably could have gotten away with one size smaller. Its pretty, and I look forward to wearing it.


Beautiful dress. I am a size between 8 and 10. Ordered the 10 and it is just a little big up top. However fits my body very well. Touch's the florr which is amazing BC I am tall 5'9 and it is very hard to find a dress that is long enough.


nice dress, simple but elegant


LOVE THIS COCKTAIL DRESS IT FITS WELL AND LOOKS GREAT!


I liked the dress, but  first thing is the bust was way too loose. I ordered a size 6. I had to take it in to get fixed. If you have a size D cup, it would fit perfect. Also, the zipper on the side was sewn incorrectly, so I had to really tug on it. Which this made some threads come out. Fabric of the dress is not the best, but it worked for a one time use dress. I'm sure every dress is made different, so if  anyone else ordered it, they might of got a perfect dress.


Wore this to a Mardi Gras Ball and it was perfect. Thank goodness I looked at the sizing chart because I almost ordered the wrong size.
