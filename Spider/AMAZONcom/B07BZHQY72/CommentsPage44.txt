I love this dress so much! It long enough for me and I'm 6 feet tall and they fit perfectly.


The dress material was very thin.  I couldn't get front to properly fit right,it keep falling forward. the color was pretty it just didn't fit right on me it shows every curve, even the one's you don't want showing. I wouldn't have been comfortable wearing it. the dress did not meet my expectation. I will be returning item to you on tomorrow.


The dress was nice, when ordered, it was too big so I had to return it. Very pretty and nice material


This dress is very beautiful. I will have to tighten the straps to give my breast a bit more support because it is a bit loose. Other than that it is perfect


The dress was okay but the dress was a little too lose near the side of the breast area. The color is actually a little darker than the color of the dress in the picture and from cut of the dress was lower than I expected.


Gorgeous dress, I wore this for my wedding reception and I loved it!!


Ordered my correct size a womens 4 and it was way too small. The material felt cheap as it is. Overall I would have kept the dress since it was a last minute one time event anyway but it was way too small.


I'm thinking of using these as BMW dresses for my.wedding in January and I ordered and received within 4 days. It fit really nicely and.has.a.nice.train that makes it look elegant.


I used this dress several times, once for a cruise and again for a charity ball - both times flawless!


My mom loved it.
