The dress is beautiful. On the average, I wear size 10.  This dress was too big.  I would have to have alterations done.


I'm 5'7 and got the dress in a 6 and it fit like a glove. It's perfect. Can't wait to wear it to my boyfriends sisters wedding.


great dress


This dress was too short for me. I am 5 feet 9 inches. I could wear the dress with flats, but it is too short with heels. Otherwise it was exactly what i was looking for.


The dress was very nice just too long need some touch ups in the back very light wear thank you


Needed a size bigger because the zipper wouldn't zip all the way up but otherwise the dress is pretty and I would recommend people buying this dress you to get a size bigger


it fit as i thought not to big not to small.it will be perfect for my friends wedding. thank you


I am not a bridesmaid but thought it would be a good dress to have in my wardrobe for those occasions when I might need a formal dress.  This dress, however, is not as it appears in photo at all.  It is cut short in the front which was not apparent in the photo.  The sizing is proportional to a junior, of which I am not.  Lastly, it is very flimsy, not elegant or sophisticated.  For the price, I was dreaming.  It would be a great buy for a bride (and her maids) on a shoestring.


Beautiful dress but not for a chesty lady my daughter is a 32D and there wasn't enough material to cover her appropriately


it is wonderful! the dress is exactly the same, that i was expecting for. hope that will have more good things from you.
