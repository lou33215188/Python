This dress was exactly as the picture. Only problem it fit a bit big on the sleeves, but over all its a great product!


For the money, you cannot buy a better dress. Bought this as a bridesmaid's dress. Very pleased so far.


This dress arrived fast. I loved it. As I am an older lady who wears a 34D, I decided the low, low cut of the dress front would probably not be the best look for me to wear as a bridesmaid at my dear friend's wedding.  It is a very lovely dress though.


The dress is too tight in the midriff and much too large in the bust.  It will be returned.  I do like the color and fabric.


I bought this dress for a modeling shoot. I love the dress it is very pretty and very elegant. I have not done the shoot yet but I cannot wait!


It fit a bit tooâ€‹ large. I called customer service and they were incredible! I got my money back and the service was amazing.


The dress came in right on time. The color is quite nice unfortunately I ordered a size too big. A little disappointed in the thin material, although it is lined , but not enough to return it. Btw the top does run big. I'm 5'10" , 200 lbs mostly solid, with a 38DD-DDD, I ordered the 16 and really should have gone for the 14. But even then I think the top would be larger than planned. Going to have it altered and maybe have a bra put in. I guess not bad for the price. Will save it for some summer activities


Fit better than the others I brought in this order


I bought those dress for my wedding and my bridesmaid look beautiful in them they fit perfectly and the price was right


I wore this dress to a wedding and looked fabulous.  I am 5 9 and the dress fit nicely. The beast part was big so I had to adjust the back straps so that it would fit nicely around my breast. I got tons of compliments that night.
