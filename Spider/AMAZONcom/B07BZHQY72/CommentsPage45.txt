Very large in the bust and very long. Would need to alter to be wearable.

This dress is beautiful and elegant.


So, I measured myself recently for another thing. I know what size I generally wear, and even ordered in a size larger than usual in case they ran small (I can always have it taken in, if necessary).  This dress was NOT the size stated in the size guide, and runs ridiculously small. Like, smaller than Calvin Klein sizing small. Their "size 4" is probably closer to a size 00 from other places.  It's a beautiful dress, though a bit short for my frame, and I'm a little unhappy that I won't be able to wear it.


The fabric is thin, but seems well-made enough for the price point and for something i wouldn't wear more than a time or two.  Anyway, if you're looking for a pretty, cheap dress, and if you settle on this one, just keep in mind to order it a couple sizes larger than you think.


This dress fit beautifully, there is no room for wiggle in the rib cage but I'm pretty narrow so I lucked out. I didn't need to wear a bra or cutlets and was fine- the train is long so practice walking in it before a bit event. There isn't lining, it is just silk but- who's looking INSIDE your dress, huh? It really does look great.
