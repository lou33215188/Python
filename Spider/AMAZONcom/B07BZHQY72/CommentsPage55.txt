I normally wear a size 10 but ordered this dress in size 14.  Nice dress for the price. If you don't like to show cleavage, this isn't the dress for you.


I ordered the 6&8, the 8 didn't arrive in time, it fit but not well enough for me to feel comfortable for the whole evening. It was beautiful on though...


Does not look like pic


Product would of been nice if the bust was more accurate, it was much bigger than I would expect for the size I had and I actually have a large bust so I was surprised of how big it was.


Really beautiful and very elegant. I thought it would look cheap because of the price but it was not at all. Fits in all the right places


the bust was a bit big and the dress as too long, I am 5'9"


This dress was a nice idea, but the quality was so cheap I didn't get a second thought in returning it.


It was pretty.  But I used the sizing chart and it was still too small. The material was also very very thin & totally see thru, but I could have adapted it to make it work if ot would have fit


This item was a disappointment it was large and di not hang right. it looked lovely in the picture,


Pretty, but sent it back, runs large, and material was very wrinkled.
