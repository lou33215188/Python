pretty dress and good price. Unfortunately, the dress I received was too large. I think this brand/dress runs large.


i really love this dress, but it was to small for me :-( I tried to alter it but i couldn't. but its very beautiful dress, i only wish i took a medium instead of small


horribly made and cheap looking


Bought for my niece and she loved it and looked absolutely gorgeous in it.


Sweatshop garment as indicated by the price.  Steer clear.


bust was waaaay to small for all three of us (we had to get different dresses for the wedding!)


Pretty dress but did not fit at all. Runs very small.


Too small at the bust and the material not too fond of it. Not a great fit for me but maybe someone else might have better luck.


I like the dress but the top is a bit too big so I will have to get it altered at an additional cost.  It is worth the original price though and I would recommend it to others.


My wife loved it!
