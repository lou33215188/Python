It's a pretty dress but I still have to fix the straps and take in the side of the top.


Nice enough dress, but runs small and had to return


Slightly big but I think the size 4 would have been too small


Lovely dress but the green is much darker than expected. The straps are also far too long and required some tailoring. Other than that no complaints. I got rave reviews for it.


I needed a gown for a Mardi Gras ball and this is perfect. Simple, comfortable, and inexpensive! I could use one in every color!


Lovely dress but the cut was not right for my body type. I think it's still a great buy, just not for me.


After getting the straps taken in the dress fit perfect!


Love, Love, Love the dress!!!!


I first ordered this dress in a 4 - I'm 5'4" and 125lbs and it would not zip up.  I reordered in a 6 and it fit perfectly.


I did try the machite blue color first... it wasn't as blue as the picture and although the color was great I decided that it was going to match the bridal party too much (it's for a wedding) and reordered the green.  The green is darker than the picture, but no complaints on that.


i ordered the black one,i wear it in a wedding and i love it. the shipment was fast... is sexy and beautiful dress.
