I gave it a four out of five for a couple reasons:


Pros:


-The "Green" color is gorgeous! After reading the other reviews and knowing it would be more deep blue green then the true green of the image shown.


-I am 5'4", 32C, slender build, normally wear a size 2 but went by measurements.  Fits perfect around the torso right where the empire waist should.


-Quality of fabric and sewing is better then expected for the price


Cons:


-This dress is crazy long, I will have to hem at least 4-5" depending on shoes (this was noted in past reviews so really doesn't factor into my scoring, but thought it should be mentioned)


-The fabric across the breasts flattens out the middle of the boob as the pattern originally didn't account for extra room in the center of each piece by including the fabric and then darts for shape


-Will have to have cups sewn in because of last statement (more $ to spend)


I am attending a very formal wedding in late fall and my life style doesn't quite match that to spend $$$ on a dress for one occasion.  But really what is a better reason to get a new dress then a wedding!  This was in my price range and it is lovely.  Hubby was wowed just when I tried it on wrinkled out of the package.  Will be spending $25 to hem and have cup inserts added.  WOULD BUY AGAIN!


Pretty Dress though not much room for a big bust.  I got a bigger size and would have had to alter at the chest, but didn't have time.  Great buy for the price though.  Color was nice, too.  Deep purple.


Beautiful dress. A size up would jave been perfect..i dont have enough time to exchange it my wedding is next week. Overal i like the dress


poorly tailored


I didn't know my exact size and they made it so easy to exchange for the right size. It only took like 3 days to get the correct size.  And the quality of the dress is outstanding.


Horrible fit and horrible material. Ito only looks nice on the Picture.


I was a little bit skeptic about the craftsmanship of this dress, but I was proven wrong. It looks great and doesn't look cheap. I ordered the size 6. The top part is a little big, but I was expecting that since I'm smaller on that area.


This dress is definity worth the money. I did get a size 4 and it was too small. Typically I wear a size 6 but often I fit a 4 in dresses. These sizes are true to size. I had to contact the company and they were very easy to deal with for the exchange. For the price; you can't go wrong with this dress. Also I bought the white one....it is not see through which was a fear of mine.


This dress fits perfectly. I used the size chart provided and I couldn't be happier with the results. I was leary to buy a dress online but I'm so glad I took the plunge! This dress is simple and classy & just what I was hoping for


I purchased this dress for a valentine's ball.  First of all I read every review I could read and decided that I would go ahead and purchase this dress even though many reviewers stated the zipper and the dress was cheap. I'm a 38DD so many of the reviews stated that I would not have a problem with the bust part in the dress, but I did because the dress was so thin that I had to go out and purchase not only a bra that was backless but I also purchased bra pads and tape because of the thinness in the dress. I purchased the dress so far in advance, that I continued to try it on weekly to make sure it fit properly.  Well the day of the event while getting dress, I had on all my accessories and makeup.  The dress was the last item I had to put on and guess what???? The dress zipper broke as I was putting it on. Mind you I was not at home I was staying in a hotel that was closer to the event but also not too far from my home.  So I had to go home and look in my closet and find a dress to wear.  I still look cute but I did not have on a long dress like everyone else in my party.  I was really disappointed. I have requested a refund and will be returning it.  The dress looks cute in the picture but I would not buy it, its not worth it.....
