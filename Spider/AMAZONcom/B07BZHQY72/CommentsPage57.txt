I love the dress I just order a size to lg I wear a 14 I order a 16 and it was to lg so the dress is true to your size a 14 would have been just right .


It's really nice. Quality and price great


I loved the dress, esp the color. I had to get some of the bottom cut off because it was too long but it flowed well.


I am don't have a lot up top, so I had to get that adjusted. But I loved the fit after my minor adjustments and turned some heads:)


Love this dress. Fits perfect. So glad I got it. :) great for a wedding! Can't wait to wear it this weekend


The dress fits amazing and it surpassed my expectations. The material is more than I expected. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and will buy again from ever pretty without hesitation. I just hope they keep it up.


Beautiful dress for a great price! Definitely need to wear some shape wear to hide my tummy....I got the white dress and it doesn't look cheap at all! Currently searching for a bra that will work with it


As soon as I put the dress on, it ripped right down the seam! The material was super thin and cheaply made. Additionally, the dress was not true to size. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.


But did not fit well at all. I ordered according to the size chart, but the bust was (way) too big and seemed to be cut much lower than in the pic. Waist and hips were a good fit, but the top would have required some serious tailoring if I wanted to wear the dress. This one went back.


But it fit my daughter so I just gave it to her.


love how it fits, the color is bright and for the price is a great deal. Im 5-6 and it long enough
