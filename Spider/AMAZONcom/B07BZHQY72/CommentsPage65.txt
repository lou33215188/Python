This was the first dress I saw that was similar to the one I was gonna get but it was 250.00. This is the only one I have found like it. I love it absolutely love it


It fits too small, it's a gorgeous piece of clothing, but it fits to small. I'm gonna have to sell it


Didn't like the way it fit...


The dress is beautiful but it does not fit even though I matched my measurments to the sizing chart. There is no seller details so I have no way to return it.


I love this dress I accidentally ordered a size to small so I ordered a replacement it's a great value and very elegant.


Fit as expected, just not my style; didn't fit up top.


Fits as expected. Zipper isn't very durable but will last for the occasion purchased for.


Love this dress!  Elegant fabric and cut.  Needed a bit of tailoring up top to be perfect but worth the effort.


It does expose to much of my breast and I do need a smaller size .The material is wonderful and I love the bottom where it trails.


Although it was long enough, it was not flattering on my daughter who is 5' 10" and smaller chested.  She said it showed every "flaw".  Returned and ended up buying the Max and Cleo Esther knit dress http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007GOQ32C/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 which was so pretty!  I will include a picture on that review.
