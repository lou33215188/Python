I loved that the fabric was giving and not binding! I loved the price, color, and fit. I also enjoyed receiving it quickly. All good.


Love it! Very flattering! I thought were it was sewed together on the bust was odd, but it looked nice and the fabric was quality, so I can't complain!


I wear this during wedding's when I have to play photographer. Perfect for an semi-formal event and the twirl factor is great. It does run large so I would suggest sizing down.


Love the dress! So happy with my purchase


Really pretty dress. Looks even better on than the picture!


Fit very different from the picture. Was cheaply made and the stitches were already coming  apart at the top when I received it.  I was Not satisfied at all.


Love this dress.  Blue is a pretty soft blue - a little different that what it shows online.  My daughter is 115lbs 5'5 and the small is a perfect fit.  Length is nice with a full skirt for a perfect vintage look. Fabric has a bit of stretch to it.  Nice because it doesnt wrinkle easy. She got so many compliments wearing it.


TO LARGE FOR GRANDDAUGHTER BUT I COULD WEAR IT.


I'm 5"10 the dress fit Perfectly!!!!!! I ğŸ’– it!!!!!!


Bought for a 1940's Ball and it was perfect!!
