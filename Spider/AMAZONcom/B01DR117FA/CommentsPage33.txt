This dress was magnificently crafted! I purchased it for a special event in the fall, hoping that it would hug my curves and accentuate my body well. I ordered a size US size 4-6 (I wear a 6, primarily) and when it arrived, I was beyond happy with the results. Although the color seems a little bit more orange-y than red to me, in the dim light it still looks very romantic and flattering. The packaging had left a million wrinkles in the dress, but it's nothing some steaming can't fix. It even looks nice without a petticoat, as advertised in the picture. I am massively pleased!
