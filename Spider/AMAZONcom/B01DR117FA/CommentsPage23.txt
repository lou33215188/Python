Loved it! Exactly what I was looking for, glad I ordered a medium because I was right between a med & large in the bust and it fit nicely!


Since I'm in between sizes right now I wasn't sure how the dress would fit on me. I ended up purchasing the bigger size just to be on the safe size and when I tried it on it fit perfectly! I love the material of the dress, it's light weight and comfortable. And I couldn't be happier.


Really cute. I don't like the color but have to get something in this shade of pink for a wedding.  The large was a little too large and the medium was a little too small.  It is stretchy.


This dress really is as great as everyone says! I wasn’t too sure what size I should get but this is the small. I’m 5’5” and wear s/m for tops. I’m wearing the dress with a petticoat underneath. I’ll post more pictures and more of a review after wearing it longer.


Fits like a dream! Love the fabric, and the stretch it has. I am 5' 9" and 130 pounds, and I got a small. Wore it to a Christmas ball, and got so many compliments!!!


This is a beautiful dress that fits like a dream. It was a perfect court house wedding dress. It is not iron safe though it might burn its very close to costume material but photographs wonderfully, i would recommend dry cleaning


The material was cheap and I was not able to wear dress so 've was to big and poor quality. Need to return it.


Wow! I've ordered dresses through Amazon before but they have always ended up being of cheep quality and the size chart way of! This dress fit me like a glove and is so pretty and comfotable. The fabric is a little thicker then I expected but that's fine.


Love the material, top quality. Fabulous feel and cut


The dress is nice for the price. It is very comfortable and stretchy. I got a lot of compliments when I wore this dress.
