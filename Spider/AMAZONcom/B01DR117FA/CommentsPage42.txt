So cute & fit me perfectly.


This dress is so beautiful.


I like the fit and feel. Is more stretchy than I expected. Color is a violet purple.


As mentioned in other comments, I definitely recommend taking out the awkward stitches to give your ladies some breathing room.


In love with this dress!!!! I'm 6' tall and the dress hits right below my knee, this is exactly what I was looking for. The dress is so flattering on, I have larger chest 40D and the dress is still modest enough but sexy at the same time. My husband loves this dress on me.


high quality material with slight stretch. lots of compliments.


Cute dress just too big for me wish I would of ordered a medium I had to send it back


I got so many compliments wearing this! The fit is perfect. It's comfortable and flattering. The material is stretchy but holds it's shape.


I love this dress! Great material and fit


The dress is beautiful. Fits great. My problem is you can't dry clean nor Iron. Wash by hand and dry. But made a great Princess Peach costume for me.
