Perfect :)


Fits just right.


I look amazing in this beautiful dress..  I will purchase the black also..


I love this dress the fabric was excellent quality and I love the vintage look.


Slightly to big


I like it have not worn it yet


fits perfectly! love the color!


The dress is well made, the color is great, the skirt length is perfect, and the neckline is pretty. But it is very short-waisted. The bottom of the middle panel is about 1,5" above my belly button, which makes it feel like it is riding up. The stretchy fabric makes it feel a little loose, even though it appears to be the right size. I'm hoping it'll feel a little more natural when I have the petticoat underneath it. I like it, but I don't love it the way I love the picture of it.


Very lovely dress


comfortable
