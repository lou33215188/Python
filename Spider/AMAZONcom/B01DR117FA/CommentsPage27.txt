I was the mother of a groom an outdoor, summer, semi-dressy, mountain wedding.  I felt sooo elegant, feminine, and fun!  Just what I had been looking for!  Perfect for dancing.


I love the dress! It fits perfectly! I'm super picky and it's perfect!


Very cute, fit well as I ordered according to the size chart  The material was great, slightly stretchy and thicker than I expected for the price and very comfortable.  I would definitely buy dresses from GownTown again.


I am in love with this dress. Fits perfectly and looks great on.


Beautiful dress reasonable price but the fabric has more stretch than I'd like. Cut, style, and swing are great. I'm 5' 9' and the hem length is perfect hitting just below the knee.


Wife purchased as a party dress. It fit as expected and looks very nice. It is a quality item, especially given the low price.


So pretty and fits so well.  If it was silk or satin it would be perfect.  I still love it for my upcomingâ€‹ event.


Top doesn't look exactly like photo when tried on, comes a little high, going to snip one tack and see how that works. Pretty dress


One of my Favorite dresses


Well made, heavy material that's a beautiful color.  Fits where it's supposed to and has some stretch for breathing room.  I was worried it wouldn't fit my bust because I'm currently breastfeeding, but it's perfect.  I might take in the sides a bit but other than that I love it.  It's dressy but fun.  I'm glad I bought it for all the weddings I'll be attending this summer!
