Fit perfect.  Ordered xl. Usally a size 14.  Very comfortable and pretty color.


Love the dress for so perfectly Will be ordering again soon.


I wore this dress to an afternoon wedding, got many compliments. It fit perfectly, true to size & nice material. Definitely will buy another.


The dress is really pretty the material is a stretch knit which means you can go down one size


Don't really like the fabric but cute dress.


The dress is lovely the material is great. It's slightly too big, but I couldn't wear a smaller size either.


This is NOT RED....it's orange.


Threads hanging out front and I was disappointed. Dress too big had to send back


beautiful color and beautiful dress.  It is too big so, I'm going to order in a smaller size.


I am usually a 3x but the 2x fit perfect the material is so fresh and so stretchy loved it!!!!! Can not wait to buy more in different colors
