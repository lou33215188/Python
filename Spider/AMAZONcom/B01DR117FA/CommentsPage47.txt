love it get a lot of oh yes attudes !


I love the color and it is perfect. I should have ordered a medium. But it is still perfectğŸ˜€


For a wedding and i love it


I love this dress and cant wait to wear it out.


Ran a little large, but I love the dress!!! It looks amazing. Great value! Great style!


Dress was not what I wanted, I ordered a size down from my usual size and it was still large on me, not comfortable or flattering at all.


The size was correct and fits good. I loved the color and material is great.


It was too big and the top did not look like the picture.


I love the light pink!!! It matches the color of my husband's tie he is wearing for a wedding in August!!!!


Love the dress it fits nice even though the sleeves are to big.
