I bought an XL expecting it to fit based on reviews but a large would have been fine. Also I was excited for the soft mint green color pictures and it was not. My kid best compared it to the color blue of hospital scrubs. It's pretty, I'll probably have it tailored since it's a hassle to return.  I'm most disappointed by the color.


nice


Beautiful Dress, true red


So the color was perfect, but the dress I received was totally different than the one I ordered—completely altered bodice and waist. It’s still cute but not what I paid for.


The color was not flattering on me and the bust was to large so I returned it


I was skeptical at first about the color ,  But it surprisely matched my boyfriend's tux perfectly . honestly loved this dress it fit perfect I bought it for a wedding , very classy and very comfortable !


Beautiful


It is super soft and has a bit of stretch to the fabric. It is beautiful..and it I would wear this Al the time...is is super comfortable. I would love to to order more of these dresses!


This dress is adorable. It was a bit large for me (Small), I am 5' 5.5" 145lbs, with a muscular build. Despite this, I felt the customer service and construction of the dress were both worth 5 stars!


Nice and perfect dress really like it
