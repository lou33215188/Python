Beautiful dress, great quality.


This dress is amazing! It has a good feel and twirls nicely on the dance floor.


Little big but so cute


Dress was too wrinkled to wear and were unable to iron it as we weren't sure of the fabric type. Left it hanging for a week and still didn't get the wrinkles out. What a waste of money. It looked hideous on with the wrinkles. Very disappointed!


I really like this dress, it's forgiving in how it fits. I did have to pin the top a bit for modesty, because I'm larger in the middle than on top, but that's my fault, not the dress's.


Had some doubts ordering dresses online - had one bad one delivered from a different seller. But this one is perfect. Comfortable material that stretches in the right spots. Fits as expected. Thank you!


You might want to get a petticoat with this one


The dress is made well just runs small. It is short waisted.


Very happy with the fit and the cut of the dress. I like that the top did not gap open and it was stitched in place. Would buy again...


Really cute dress -- looks lovely
