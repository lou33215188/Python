Ordered this for my best friend.  She is normally between a 10-12, 155 pounds, 5'5.  I got her a Large and it fit her perfectly!  Was not too tight and she was able to move her arms around. Definitely need a petticoat for it though to make it poof out


I bought a s size.. and it is large


Will work great for the purpose we purchased it for.


Very pleased


Awesome dress !!


Love it.


Love the material and the fit!


I love it


I knew I would have to alter this dress due to my measurements. I ordered a size to fit my bust (the biggest size in my measurements). Currently I measure 39" bust, 28" waist and 39" hip (but hip doesn't matter in this dress).


I have never been able to wear a dress straight off the rack (my waist used to be MUCH smaller, 25", before having children), so I knew I'd have to take in the waistline.


Take measurements and use the biggest measurement between waist and bust to determine your size, and keep in mind if you have a big difference in bust and waist, the dress will need to be altered.


Very beautiful dress, but definitely purchase a petticoat, and plan to have to iron the dress because it's very wrinkly when it arrives. Also fyi this dress is suppose to only be handwash and line dry, I would imagine that would affect your decision to buy.
