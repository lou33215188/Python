The necklace line does not drop like I thought it would.


Only bad thing about it is that it was longer than I had expected...I love it  though and can't wait to wear it to the ball :)


This was the most beautiful dress! I wore it to get married to my husband as a very impromptu wedding. We threw the wedding together in 8 days! I bought a red grace karin tutu for under! Omg! The best!


Gorgeous dress!  Wore for my 10th wedding anniversary.  Old Hollywood glamour style.


The zipper is broke very tiny zipper.


Love this dress and I get many compliments. A little big on top but I feel thatâ€™s due more to my shape. :)


Terrible material. Reminds me of curtains.


I absolutely love it! Hardly write reviews and almost never order clothes online as I find it never fits me,  but this dress is perfect! Feeling so feminine ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š


Love it!  Fits true to size and has a higher waistline to complement the hips.  Ordered pink and it is a truer pink hue.  Will order another in a different color!


Beautiful dress. Have received so many compliments. And I love the design!
