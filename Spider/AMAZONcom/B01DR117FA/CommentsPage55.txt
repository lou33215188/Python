Very nice


Beautiful Dress, "unfortunately" it was a too big.  Going to exchange it for a smaller size


Ordered this dress in white. Great dress for summer date night with hubby. I ordered a small, my measurements are 33-27-36. Because of the amount of spandex in the fabric, I probably could have gone a size smaller. There's no fabric content label anywhere, nor is there care instructions anywhere. My only complaint is that I wish the bodice was completely lined. Instead it has what a seamstress would call "facing" in the bodice front. The facing does not lay right, it's either stretched out or just needs to be low heat ironed or something. It leaves a slight ripple in the bust area. The dress is comfortable and just needs a Swarovski necklace, with a clutch and heels. I have attached pics of two things that I think I can wash out...blue line, probably from seamstress chalk and a small stain about the size of a pencil eraser, it might be a pin prick (blood). I would send the dress back but I'm confident that a little "shout" spray will take care of the stain and washing will take care of the blue mark.
