There is a seam down the front middle of the skirt! Who puts a seam in the front of a skirt it's so awkward.. Returning this dress immediately.


Horrible and very cheap do not buy


Fits very well but wish the material was softer.  Does hit below the knee if you are on the shorter side as I am.


Great dress. Very comfortable stretchy but keeps its shape. Going to buy another in a different color.


Really loved this dress.
