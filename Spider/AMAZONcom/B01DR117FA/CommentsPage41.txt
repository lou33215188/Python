Used for a theatre show wedding dress. Great stretchy material.


Too large in the bust


Beautiful good quality fabric. Very well constructed dress.


Love love the fit very comfortable


Way to short!!!!


Great dress for the price !! Ordered a Large there's alot of stretch could order a size down and be ok


It is absolutely beautiful. I definitely did not expect the size small to fit my 32F bust but hey, I'm not complaining.


Same as the first to don't have a dress to rate I'll let you know when I get. Again pointless as the special occasion has come and gone


Love the dress!! Great material, it fits nice, stretchy. I ordered a small and I'm 5'7, 140lbs, 36 bust 29 waist. I'm very pleased.


The dress came in good condition, but it didn't fit right. Shoulders were to tight and everywhere else was to big. The color was nice though.
