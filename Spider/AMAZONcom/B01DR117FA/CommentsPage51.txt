I bought this for our Christmas program at church because we needed to be in "performance black" and so I was afraid at first to order but i thought why not I still have time to get a replacement. I got the dress today and put it on and wow! I was amazingly shocked and surprised by how well the dress fit considering I am not proportion evenly. I can't believe how beautiful I felt in the dress even my little girl loved it.


Definitely going to have to order another color


Material was a dull purple. Not impresed at all. One star only because i have to


Loved my dress it fit like a glove !


Sent it back, because it was too big


it wore fantastic it looked great had a lot of complaiments


Good material, made well, nice and stretchy. Looked great on!


pretty dress but it is cut large. best to go down a size.


My new 'go to' dress! Fits amazing


Good quality fabric. Excellent fit


It is a Cinderella blue but it worked so well for Dapper Day. Got so many compliments on the dress.
