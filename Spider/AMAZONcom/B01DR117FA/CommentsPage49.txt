The material is like curtain and  dies not wear well. Will be giving to goodwill


So cute.


I could not believe the quality of this dress for such an affordable price! I love vintage-esque fashion and have seen dresses like these on Modcloth and Unique Vintage with higher pricetags.  I bought this one for a work holiday party in the navy polka-dot and it looked great.  It has that ever-so-flattering sweetheart neckline that wasn't too low cut and appropriate for the occasion.  I'd say it was a midi length with a decently full skirt that accentuated my waist.  I didn't need a crinoline underneath it and it wasn't too over-the-top like I was wearing a costume, more of an elegant pinup-ish look.  It didn't come with a sash or belt but it defined my waist so well that I didn't feel the need to wear one. The cap sleeves were perfect and didn't make my arms look like Vienna sausages.  It was really comfortable but the fabric was kinda swishy, which I don't mind. I bought a Medium and it fit perfectly. Seems like it would flatter a good range of body types too.


Love the stretch. Fabric has a slight sheen to it.


So soft, very comfortable.


It is a lot longer than I like. I will take it up a bit.  Beautiful color and nice fabric.


I really liked how the dress fit and the fabric texture was good and was soft to touch.


Loooove it!


This is cute as a button! I like this a lot. So stretchy so you can still ear at a party. Fits perfectly


I liked the give of the material and fit, but I had to send it back due to a huge seam down the front of the dress.  It looked so awkward.
