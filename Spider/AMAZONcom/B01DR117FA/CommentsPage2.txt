Great dress! Super comfy. Followed the size chart and it fit perfect. Just as pictured. And yes, cut the little string holding the chest together. Wore it with crinoline, but looks pretty even without it.


I love it !!!!!! I love so much I'm 5'1 and size 20-22 and the 2x fits great the fabric is very stretchy , I love the color is how they picture it , already order a black dress, also I bought a petticoat it makes look more fancy


I ordered the yellow polka dot dress and was hoping for the color depicted in the image. Unfortunately, it's darker and closer to mustard. I bought it for a wedding and it doesn't match the color. It's a bummer because I wanted it to be awesome.


Liked this dress a lot. Wore it to a wedding. The cleavage is tricky, slips down a bit--be careful not to slouch!!ğŸ˜± If I wear it again, I might consider taping it to my bra or something.


In the photo, the dress is paired with a petticoat. Was delivered very wrinkled, but ten minutes of being outside in humidity fixed it.


Very well made dress.  The fabric is very nice and swings/ drapes well.  It does have a fair amount of give, so you can move in the dress without fear


 of ripping the seams. The color was just like the picture (I bought the dark blue).  I am 5'1", 175 and 36DDD girls and should have bought the XL not the xxl (a little too big is better then a too small).  I did cut the tack threads at the bust line and gave the girls more room.  I wore this dress to a wedding and my husband LOVED it.  I got several comments how well i looked. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is it had no pockets.  I am a aesthetic and need a place to stash my inhaler.  (note i did add a pocket myself)  I was able to iron out the few wrinkles from shipping.  I will buy more in different colors (dark red next) and a smaller size.  Buy it you will not be sorry.


This dress is beautiful, comfortable, and made me feel like a star. I did cut out the little tack to make the cleavage pop, as others had suggested and it just made it fit a little better. Super stretchy material, clings in the right places and it's everything I want in a night on the town dress.


I love this dress so much. It was a little bit bigger than I wanted. I ordered a large just to see. But this one looks great too. I am 5 ft 2 in and 180 lbs with 38DDD bra size and carry my weight in my stomach for those looking for reference.


I usually wear a Medium, I was hesitant to order the medium as some reviews were saying order a size up. I ordered the medium. I love the dress and the quality. I thought it would fit snug, but it fits a little big around my waist.  I have an hour glass figure so my waist is much smaller than my bust or hips.  I wear a 32DDD so I was worried about the top, which fits perfectly. I'm 5'6 at 140 lbs.  I would say the dress fits true to size for most people .


After searching high and low for a black bridesmaids dress, I found a recommendation for Gowntown.  This dress, my saving grace - itâ€™s stretchy, comfortable, and hits nicely on the waist.  And such a value at the cost!  It doesnâ€™t fit perfectly, but still looks good and can be customized.  I ended up taking out the stitch in the bust area and pinning it.  Itâ€™s also good for any formal occasion.  Just a warning, get a steamer for this dress or just put it in the dryer on low - do not go near it with an iron!!


I didn't expect material to be as stretchy as it was. I would have gotten a size smaller had I realized. With that said I received tons of compliments on this dress. This dress looks good without the petticoat but it looks spectacular with the petticoat. I suggest you buy the petticoat to go with along with this and any of the 1950's dresses.
