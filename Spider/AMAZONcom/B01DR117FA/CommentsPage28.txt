I purchased this dress as a gift ofr a friend.  It fits her like it was tailor made for her.  Couldn't be more pleased


Somewhat large in the bust. Also, definitely make sure you have a slip for the white dress. It is moderately see through.


The fit of this dress is perfect! So happy with the stretchy material. I wear a L in normal clothes and the Large fit just right. I am using this as a base for my Halloween costume and I am over the moon happy!


Wonderful. Absolutely perfect. This dress fits exactly how you think it does. I was very concerned with it not being "big girl" friendly, but it is so flattering and the material is stretchy. I'm beyond happy with this dress. It also arrived super quick! I will DEFINITELY order another one. ğŸ˜Š


Meant for a VERY busty woman. I'm 38c and it looked bunchy. Plus there was an image ruining  stitch holding the Boob pieces together. Ididn't get it. waist was not as flattering as i thought it would be.


The material is high quality and it fits perfect. I have big boobs for my body size, so finding anything that fits them is rare. Love it.


Love this dress! It is for my Chaplain Graduation. I bought the petticoat and it makes it fluffy on the skirt. The bodice is not revealing. I ordered the large I could have gone with a medium. I will keep it because i will be doing a lot of walking and eating at the event.


She loved it. It looked very nice on her. It's a perfect dance party dress. The color was beautiful on her.


Dress seems to be a very good quality, enough material on bottom to puff out with under tutu half slip.  Is somewhat Stretchy.  I was going to order the red one too and see which one I liked better color wise.  This was going to be used as a 50's costume.  I am 5'5 about 160 lbs and it fit just below my knees.


This dress is absolutely beautiful.  Comfy fit and fabric.  However, the dress was a little too long for my daughter and we didn't have time to have it hemmed before her Homecoming Dance.  Otherwise, it was a perfect fit!
