I didn't like this dress because the sewing seam in the front center of the dress.  That was not very flattering.  It was a stretchy material which was nice but I just couldn't get past the seem down the middle.


The dress is a great fit but the yellow isn't really a true yellow. It's rather dingy looking, as if I washed it with dark colors and they bled on the dress.


It is a beautiful dress. But, it was not as shiny as shown. The material was very stretchy and somewhat thick.


This just arrived and I LOVE it!  The fabric is so soft and unlike many clothes ordered online it fits SO nicley!  I am THRILLED!!!


Beautiful dress.


Haven't gotten to wear it out yet, but it's a cute dress


I’m extremely pleased with quality of this dress. I’m a reliable 8-10 size medium and this dress is perfectly sized. I actually painted the skirt for an event and the material held up to the paint beautifully.


I like the style but the fabric was terrible. It feels very rubbery and unflattering when you wear it.


Exactly as pictured and true to size! Such a classic look that I love!


Pretty dress, nice fit!
