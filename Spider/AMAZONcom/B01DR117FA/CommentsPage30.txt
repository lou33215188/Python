Its big, but nice n a really good material, I would have ordered a size down


Love the fabric, stretch, and fit of this dress. The full circle skirt is AMAZING!  I will order more from this company.


Absolutely perfect dress!  Really nicely fitted with such comfortable, nice, fabric.  (Fabric has a bit of stretchiness to it).  Very pleased with this purchase.


Material is stretchy and entire dress fits perfectly. It's super comfy and i felt good wearing it! Im 5'7", 280lbs, weat a dress size 18. I bought a 2x and could slip it on without unzipping it. So i hope that helps!


It's ok, not my favorite but it worked for the price and I didn't have time to shop


Returned. Seemed like a quality sown item, just wasn't flattering for me.


I ordered it small because I knew the sizing was a bit off.  It fits perfect.  My only complaint is the bust of the dress is a little weird at the neck line


The cut is wrong. Waist too high.


Loved it. Ordered a bigger size, but it still looks nice. And it's made of good material.


I bought this dress for my Vegas wedding. The chest part was terrible. It looked like I had a 3rd boob. Was going to return it but decided to have a seamstress try to fix it. Only made it worse. Money wasted. The color would have been perfect for my wedding. ğŸ™„
