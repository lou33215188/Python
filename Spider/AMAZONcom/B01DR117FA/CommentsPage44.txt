I love my dress


Purchased for a Halloween costume and my daughter loves this dress, particularly the stretch of the fabric


Loved it


It fit with room but not in an uncomfortable or unflattering way.I probably could've gone a size down because there is alot of stretch.


Plenty of stretch. I ordered a Medium, and it was a great fit.


Good quality, way too big.  Not quite yellow, more like lime green.


Itâ€™s stretchy fabric and amazing texture. Make sure to get a size larger ğŸ˜Š


Bought this dress for my daughter and she couldn't be happier.  The cut and length of the dress is super cute while still being appropriate for a 16 year old girl.


My husband LOVES this dress on me!! I love it too!! Fits perfect!


My dress hugs me at the top and at the bottom it's open to different occasions..... Lol.....
