This dress is perfect! I removed the stitches in the neckline to make it fit better, but I am so pleased with this dress overall. I will definitely be buying more colors.


I am so in LOVE with this dress! It fir perfectly and I got so many compliments on the dress, this is probably my new favorite dress that I am proud to own.


Fits great and has stretchy material so it is very comfy.


Love the fabric, nice and fresh. Looks very nice on I am a medium and it fit a bit loose, not too much though. I will buy a couple more, very confortable!!


The material is very flexible could have went my actual size, but when ordering it's best to order a size up...The fabric is Wonderful very comfortable....The color is beautiful....


I purchased this dress for my daughter's cotillian. I had received a lot of complements that night. The material was of a really nice quality and the fit was perfect.


Too much like one I had. Changed mind!


Don't like the color , I ordered pink and it is dull! I got the large size because the reviews said to go a size smaller that they run big!! That was a mistake!! Well now I have an incentive to loose some weight!!!


Dress fit well and so comfortable!  It is made of a comfortable light weight stretchy fabric with no lining which was perfect for our island beach celebration.  So many compliments and the quality of it, I've considered ordering it in another color too!


This has a great fit, it has stretch.  If you are wearing this to a wedding the skirt has great twirl-ability.
