Love this dress. Fits perfectly! And the material is thick. It's not a cheaply made dress


I love this dress!  This is my 2nd time purchasing in another color. So comfortable and flattering!


It was to large in the bust area. But it was still a pretty princess dress.


Beautiful dress,  nice material,  and it fit very well. Would recommend.


Great dress ! Very stretchy so you might be able to wear a smaller size


Dress was very comfortable and fit me perfectly.


The dress arrived as dated and was a better quality than I expected. It was also a very good fit.


I didn't want it to be too tight, so I ordered on the larger size! I LOVE the dress though! It worked perfectly!


5'6, 130 pounds, 32D and the size small fits perfect! Perfect swish and the material doesn't feel cheap.


Loved it!  Very flattering, nice material and perfect red color!
