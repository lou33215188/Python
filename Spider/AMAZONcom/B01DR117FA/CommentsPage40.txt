You cannot iron this dress. At all. Couldn’t wear it for my sisters shower because of that.


I love the dress style its self, its jut not the right fit for me.


I love the color and the way it looks on me. However, the shoulders fit too loosely.


Order arrived on time,  it was great right color and it fit like a glove.  Thank you so very much!!!


Great dress! Super stretchy which helps it fit beautifully, the only problem for me is the chest. Definitely made for bigger boobs and I don’t quite fill it out.


use the size chart.  I did and bought up a size from what I normally wear, and it fit perfectly.


Wore to an event, I got lots of compliments !!


love this dress


Beautiful dress, ordered too big.


AWESOME dress fits perfectly.  I Love the fabric, it doesnt feel cheap.  Well made.
