Great dress and for a great price. It was quite wrinkled from the packaging, so don't expect to be able to wear it right away.


Love, Love, Love this dress!!! Fits beautifully, and the neckline is very flattering. As is the rest of it!!


Love it.


Bought for an upscale event. The event was cancelled but I can't wait to wear this dress it is flattering and comfortable and hits in all the right places


It was a lovely dress but it was not flattering to my figure so I returned it.  Also, I had some difficulty with the zipper. It wouldn't unzip all the way down.


really love It. The color is beautiful. Washes up well and very little ironing needed.


Perfect!!!


Beautiful dress, amazing quality for the price!


I am always a bit nervous ordering clothing on line.  I was pleasantly surprised that it fit perfect.  It is a very classic looking dress.


A little snug, but cute dress.
