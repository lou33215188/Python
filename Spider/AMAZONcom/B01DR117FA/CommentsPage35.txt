The fabric looks good and in general is a nice dress, the problem is that the front part, it's poorly made and looks odd, so I had to take it to someone to fix it.


Does not breath at all.  Fit is a little large for me.


Beautiful stylish dress!  Gets lots of compliments every time I wear it!!


I thought the small would be too small.  Instead it is a little larger than I wanted.


I like the dress but the color was not bright enough.  Great fit, but the red is dull.  Would like a shinier material.  Not dressy enough for a wedding or formal affair to me.


Soooo cute! Fabric has a little give to it which makes it fit very nicely but allows it to stay very comfy.


I followed the size chart, and I could have gone down a size. I know my measurements perfectly, and while this technically fit, it was just a bit too big. Size down for a snug vintage fit.


This is a great dress for the price. The fabric is good quality, it arrived quickly and it was very comfortable. I felt great the entire time I had it on and received a lot of compliments.


Extremely comfortable and true to size. Would purchase again.


I am so in love with this dress!!!!
