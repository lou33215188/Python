So pretty!  Wore a crenoline under it for extra fullness


This dress is fabulous!  Great fabric and true fitting.  I'm 5'1 123 lbs (I remarked about my size because others did and it helped me choose just the right size. Medium.  I need to hem the dress but that is common and I like things a bit shorter.


I'm using this for a gender bent joker cosplay and I'm overjoyed that it fits and is such a great color!


This swing dress is beautiful. Was very wrinkled when I received it. Have to figure out how to iron it.


This is an amazing yellow color and the stretch is unbelievable.


It's okay. Color is darker, which I like. The threading is frayed right in the front, and was dirty, like someone had drug it on the floor. The fit is fine, and looks okay. I needed it for a wedding, and will keep it as a back up.


I was so pleasantly surprised as the fit and quality of this dress! I'm rather busty so I have to buy a large enough size to accommodate. The stretch in the fabric is just right too.


I have a large bust and small waist (comparatively) - this dress is comfortable and fits great!


Perfect color, perfect fit. Be careful when ironing. Natural tendency would be to have a high setting to get wrinkles out but you don't want to scorch the material.


Very pretty. Stretchy material. Just a little loose on me, that's why i sent it back. I'm not really a curvy girl, and i think the generous cut was a little more for girls with bigger "girls" *ahem* I am 5'8" 160 lbs and the XL was just a tad big. I might try a large in the future.
