I'm smaller in the bust line so I retacked the stitch on the bust overlap. Fits perfectly.


The blue was a little lighter than it looks, and it was long on me, went past knees. I'm 5'3". Would be much cuter if it was shorter.


A nice dress, but the fabric is very noisy and far too sheer. I had to return it.


the dress has some stretch to it. I probably could've gotten an 8 and it would've been more snug. It fits pretty well though. the chest area is a little big for me, but nothing a push-up can't fix! :D


I bought three of these dresses for my bridesmaids and they fit like a glove. I even bought one for myself they were so adorable and comfortable. The material is good quality and no loose stitching at all. Only buy through this seller cause they are the real deal.


Thankfully it was very cute still, but buyer beware. It doesn't look like the picture. It's not the same material as what it looks like (almost feels like jean) and the front too isn't what it actually looks like. If you have larger boobs but a smaller stomach it looks awkward.


I am a pear-shaped 5'6" and 140 lbs woman and I found the medium to be a little loose especially in the shoulders/bust area. It's a lovely dress, though, and I returned the medium and got a small.


The color is bit muted for my liking. Also it runs just a tad big. That aside it is a great quality dress


The fabric will never mirror what the advertisement alludes to


My cousin also love it so I gave it to her as a gift.
