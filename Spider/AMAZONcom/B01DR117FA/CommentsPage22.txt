Way too big.


Went with the sizing from the chart. Could have gone down 2 sizes easily.


It's beautiful. Love the color, the fit and the length. At first I thought it was a little long, but i got over that and now I love everything about it, including the length.


great dress just a little small will go up in size next order. Yes I will order another


Love the material! I was scared it would look like a costume but it's perfect and so pretty!


Beautiful dress. A little bit heavy. It was too large to me. I asked for a plus size as many chinese products are way to small, but this turned out to be an accurate size (I am an L o XL american size).


This dress is very nice, I got it to wear to my wedding rehearsal. I'm a size 18-20 and 40DDD Bra and the XXL fits me perfect.


Love this dress, the color, fits well...but 4 stars because I don't like the bunching at the bust...but need it for 50th reunion the Saturday night! Will wear purple cowgirl boots with it!


I am beyond impressed. For the price the quality is excellent and I am excited to wear this to a pin up party. Dress arrived quickly and fit perfectly (not an easy thing for a plus size lady) love it


Bought a small 5'6" 128 lbs, it is a bit big and the fabric is more wind breaker, less cocktail dress. 4 stars for shape and fit, but 3 for cheap fabric.


I bought this dress for graduation, and I didn't think it would arrive in time for it since it said that the expected delivery was at the end of June. This company made the dress and sent it as soon as it was done. The dress is fabulous, it fits perfectly, and it's comfortable. I'm super happy with it!
