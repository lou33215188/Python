Nice construction and quality fabric (it's not flimsy fabric). Fits as expected.


IN LOVE with this dress!  Bought it in ivory for my bridal shower and it is so incredibly cute and the fit is just perfect!  It's a  bit see through so you will need to wear something underneath it if you're buying a  lighter color.  It came quickly and nicely packaged.  Will be buying this dress in other colors!!


As with other reviews, the dress is really flattering. Lots of stretch and the length is also perfect (covers the tops of my knees). I bought the same one in navy and black. Can dress for work and add heels and some sparkle for dinner and drinks!


I love these dresses! I own two.  Very forgiving and flattering ! Stretchy material... I wear a size 14/16 and xl fits me perfectly


I'm a busty 5'4" that wears a 34ddd or a 34f. I ordered the large and it's perfect. This dress is so comfy. The dark red is beautiful. Will definitely be purchasing this in other colors.


Perfect size for me.  It's not a overly stiff material so it does have a stretchy give to it.  I'm 5'6" and the dress rests slightly below my knees.  It's flattering and breathable. Love it!


Very pretty and quite flattering.  Daughter loves it.


I wore this to a formal event with a petticoat and it was perfect. Comfortable, pretty, and fun!


Purchased for a wedding. The dress is straight up orange, not red. Very dissatisfied. Fit as expected. Poorly made. Seams coming undone right out of the package. I am returning for a refund.


Absolutely love this dress. I was very hesitant to buy a dress online, but I really loved the look of this. The flair at the bottom is just too much fun, and the top is extremely flattering. Overall super happy with my purchase. I got the black one, I think I will also have to get the wine red one too!
