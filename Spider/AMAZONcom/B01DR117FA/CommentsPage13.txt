Absolutely beautiful dress with perfect cut and quality. I noticed that some ladies don't remove the thread on decolte to fit it as advertised:-)


This beautiful dress purchased for my upcoming photoshoot and I am in love with perfect pastel color, with fabric and design overall! 50s fashion on a budget did exit my expectations ğŸ’™


I'm 5' 2", 105 lbs, bust 32C. The turquoise color is vibrant, XS fits like a dream. Wear a crinoline or petticoat underneath to make it fuller. I wore it to a dance and got a ton of compliments; it flares out nicely when you turn.


For the price the quality is a little better than I expected. COMFORTABLE! I would wear this every day if I could. I will definitely be getting additional colors. How/why did this design ever go out of style?! Beautiful but not formal as is. I thought I would need to get a petticoat, and I will if I ever wear this as a costume, but it doesn't need it. The fabric does give/stretch, so I didn't need to go a size up, though I'm happy for a little extra room and the dress still looks great. The neckline is a little higher than I expected which makes it more work appropriate.


This is a very cute dress. I was in between sizes so ordered smaller size after reading the reviews. It is cute but was just not what I needed for the event I had intended it for and I ended up returning it. Fabric was stretchy so definitely recommend going down a size. Was nice dress and seemed very well made. I gave it 4 stars just because the sizing was a bit off.


This dress fits like it was made for me. I know i will be comfortable for the performance of the nutcracker in the city. I purchased a petticoat as well. Was worried about whether it would be ok under the dress ie showing at the waist i have no worries now. Thank you i will be purchasing from this seller again.


Got it for a wedding. I was matron of honor for my sister in law. I loved it. It was comfy and pretty. I just had to cut the little seam in the chest area. I was afraid at first to have it turn out too showy, but it was fine. At least the bride said so. And on that day she was all that mattered and she asked me to pull the little seam. ğŸ˜Š


It wasn't really the size, although it was tight on my waist and loose on my chest, it was more that the color "red" was a Burgundy.  It was more Burgundy than a deep red.  Didn't work for my purposes.


This is a lovely dress made with beautiful fabric, but the first time I wore it, the seam under one arm began to fray. I can fix it - not a huge deal - and honestly, for the price it's a small problem.  However, I then laundered it according to the directions and hung it to dry. The facing around the inside of the neck is all crinkled up, like the interfacing shrunk!  I haven't tried the dress on since I laundered it, so I'm hoping that this won't show through the fabric when I wear it. The color is amazing and I received many, MANY compliments when I wore it - I just hope that the problems don't become more so that I can't wear it a second time. As a US size 18W, it is extremely flattering in my plus-size figure.


And if you are in a hurry, please be warned - it took several weeks to get this item.


My advise: check it over carefully when you get it - that seam may have been coming apart before I wore it since all I did was go to meetings in it and certainly didn't strain the fabric at all. And don't deviate one bit from the laundry instructions - I followed them and have some concerns.


I absolutely love this dress. It is super slimming, and fits very nicely. The blue color is bright. This dress was made with quality materials, and with good workmanship! I will order others again from them.


I ordered a size larger than I though I needed and was pleasantly surprised it was to big. I returned it and ordered a size smaller.


I am 5'2", 170 lbs. My bust is 48", my waist is 34" and my hips are 46". I ordered a xl the first time and the second was a l
