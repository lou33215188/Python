love it


The zipper broke down the back the second time worn.


I was so nervous about the size but I LOVE this dress! It's really stretchy and comfortable. I want it in every color, but will definitely be ordering smaller.


fit very nice.


Loved it! Perfect for a Mad Men themed party. I untacked the bodice, and added a couple darts to make the neckline fit perfectly. Material was stretchier than I expected. I am usually a medium in most things, but I got a small and it fit well. 5'4", 150lbs, 34DD.


Perfect fit, and very comfortable to wear! The yellow is very bright, and you can compliment the dress with a belt to add some more flare easliy


Gorgeous dress, well made. Only problem is a bit of a stuck zipper but that may be my fault. Good weight fabric too. Sadly I ordered it too large not remembering I lost weight recently and have to return it and wait until my size is back in stock.


The color was not the same as the picture. Has a little bit of a turquoise hue to it. Trying to be Cinderella and it's hard when the dress isn't the right color . The dress however fits. So I recommend using the size chart they use. Do not use Amazon size chart.


I love the fabric and it fits like a glove. I'm a size L and I ordered an XXL and it was perfect


Extremely cute, very affordable. Love the stretch! All of my bridesmaids are wearing this in black at my wedding, and I got it in plum as my rehearsal dress.
