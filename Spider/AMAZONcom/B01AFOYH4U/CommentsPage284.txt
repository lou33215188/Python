A little big... but, really beautifull


It's a darling dress just not what I had in kind. Very modest and classic Audrey Hepburn style. I lottle longer in length than I expected. Just below midcalf.


It looks amazing on my finance.  Such a stunning dress with her beauty.


Product as promised, very cute! Fits perfectly.  Quick shipping!


Beautiful!


Very cute dress and the small fits is perfectly!! Also it arrived just in time for my event.


A bit sheer, needs a nude bra or tank underneath. Otherwise great!


Not quite as expected. Very thin material. Makes sense for the good price, but ended up returning.


Pretty dress but does not fit someone who is larger in the breast area unfortunately:-(


The dress fit perfect, however it was more cream than white but it worked for what I needed it for.
