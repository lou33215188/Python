Fabric a bit hard. Not as flowy as it looks on the picture.


This dress fit very well, it can be dressed up with a cute pair of shoes love it wouldn't mind having this dress in other colors


I ordered this dress because I saw the fit was accurate.  When I opened the package, the white dress had blue pen stain down the front!  I needed this for an event and I couldn't even wear it because it was stained.  I'm so disappointed.


the color isn't that deep red color I was looking for and it was a little snug


The dress had an interesting design, which is why I purchased it. However, when it arrived, it looked a bit cheaply made and poor quality. Also, the material was uncomfortable.


Amazing dress! Fit perfect, good quality. I cannot wait to wear it!


The Large dress length was good for my wife that wears a size 8-10 pair of pants.  (She is 5'6") the bust size area seemed a little big.


Love the way it look on me!!!!!!!


I got this dress for my daughter for Easter and she loves it.


I have always wanted a dress like this, but was too small to wear. I will be returning it and trying a larger size to see if it will fit properly.  ***This review is given in exchange for a discount.***
