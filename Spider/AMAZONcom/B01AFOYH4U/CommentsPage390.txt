Lovely dress. Runs a bit small.


To be honest I wasn't 100% sure how this dress would look I wanted a dress fast and not in the 150$ price range of my usual rockabilly dresses. The fact that it was prime is why I ordered it I looked kute figured I could make it work wasn't even sure it would fit since I ordered a size smaller because the size I need was out of stock. The dress showed up today didn't have much hope pulled it out of the package and tried it on. And I'm in love fit like a glove. So glad I didn't order a size up. This will be the perfect dress for Disneyland or dress it up with heals for a fancy party. It's a great dress and not just for the price, I would put this dress toe to toe with my expensive dresses any day


Nice quality!
