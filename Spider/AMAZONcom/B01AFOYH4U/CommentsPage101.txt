I wear a size 16 top due to G cup and a size 14 bottom. This dress fit great in an XXL, not too tight and flattered everything. I got several compliments. I wore it with the crinoline slip and it added just enough flare.


I wore this as my wedding dress. It's simple and cute!!  I bought a petty coat to puff out the bottom and I would definitely recommend this to anyone


It fit everywhere but the bust.  Honestly! If a woman is ordering a plus size, chances are that she is NOT flat as a boy.


otherwise super adorable


Bought this dress for my daughter for Home Coming. It looks absolutely beautiful on her. Fit just perfect. The style is very retro. Thank you. Highly recommend this buyer!!


This dress is awesome! Really well made. However, they company was out of small so I had to order a medium and it was to big. I knew it would be, just thought it would work. I would recommend this dress!


Really beautiful dress. Would love to see what else this company does.


Fits perfectly and has a bit of give to the material as well. Classic.


I am 5'1" and 123 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. Hits just below the knee. I also ordered the puffy slip for a full look. It looks great with or without the slip. Well made and the fabric is nice and strong. Not too thick but definitely not thin. I have ordered another one in a different color. Ladies this one is a keeper.


This dress is beautiful,  I got so many compliments on this dress..


Nice fitting dress!!


Although I would have preferred a petite size since I like my dresses just above the knees. So I hemmed it. Over all,  I like it very much.


Great quality fabric. Beautiful pattern& color is true to pic. Fits well& i can tell it is a forgiving classic design that anyone can wear.
