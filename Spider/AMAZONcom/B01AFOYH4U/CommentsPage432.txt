lovely!


Looked exactly as picture, very bright vibrant red. The shape was just adorable on its own, I got a ton of compliments on it!


I Love this dress so much I ordered it in three different colors after getting the first it fitting nicely.


I bought this for my wife and she loves it, said it is "totally cute!"


So pretty! Elegant... And fits good


Perfect fit dress!! Got lots of compliments!!


This is so lovely! I got it for our upcoming cruise and it will be perfect! Fits snug, but not so tight I can't breathe. The material is nice and think so it isn't see through and hangs nicely. I absolutely love it!


*I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.*


This is an amazing dress! Worth  every single penny. The dress is very classy and the small fits perfectly on my 5'5" 130 pound self.


Lots of compliments Everytime I wear it!! ❤️ This dress!!


Very cute but VERY small. Order two sizes larger for accurate fit.  Material is thinner than expected. Love the style and idea.  Could use some revisions.
