I loved this dress and it was perfect for the Christmas party I went to.  I would definitely order this again.


Really liked this dress. Did not wear it to the event I planned to wear it to but it is lovely. I bought the rockabilly petticoat tutu slip to give it a wider flare. Super cute!


Great length and fit.


Dress is so nice and fits me perfectly. Very flattering style. I ordered one size up as it was suggested in the comments. I normally wear size 8 and ordered this dress in a size L.


LOVE this dress! It was comfortable and fit great!


The dress is really comfortable but a little snug. I was surprised since I ordered according to the size chart. The dress wasn’t quite what we were looking for.


This was a cute dress. It was tight on top for me. I'm 5'5" 135 34DD. It hit about 3" below my knees. The material was nice and seemed like good quality but there was little stretch and since I'm a little top heavy I had to return the dress.


It comes a bit wrinkly but all in all pretty good for the price


Beautiful dress and perfect fit!


Great dress. I’m short so it was kinda long on me..
