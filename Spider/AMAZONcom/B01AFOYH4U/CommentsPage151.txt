zipper was broken and the was a ripped in the dress


puckered at breast line


I usually wear a medium dress size. So I purchased this dress as a large. The large was too small, it fit but could not zip up. I returned that dress and purchased a XL, this size was also too small. The dress over lapped at the top of my back but still could not be zipped up. I returned the second dress and did not purchase a third.


Pretty sure this is my second review?! Anyway the dress fit well. I got an XL just in case and it was a good call. The chest area was snug but I think that's how it's supposed to be. I liked the flair and so did most of the ladies that saw me in it.


My daughter wanted this dress for her High School Graduation. She tried it on and loves it!


Really like this dress. Fit was perfect!  Wrinkles very easily. Full shirt that twirls when you dance. TuTu slip was purchased to give the dress more fullness. Brought one similar from another company and paid 3 times the price. Dress met my expectations.


Love it. I was complemented all day. I wore it to work with a red sweater. My boss asked me where I got it, because she wanted one. I have washed it and dried it and it still fits great. I noticed no shrinking. I will be buying in more colors!


I am a size 16. I am 5'9 and I wear a 38DD bra. My dress fit like it was mad for me.


I returned the dress b/c it was sort of plain and it was very hard to sip up over my bust. The rest of the dress fit fine, just the bust area is where my zipper stopped. I got a large and my bust is 38dd.


Even though it is a smidge big I LOVE IT!! Fabric is nicer than expected, skirt is long, perfect. I am so happy ordered it. I am now wanting it in more colors.


I like the material, fits as expected. Looking forward to wearing out. Thanks
