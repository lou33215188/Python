do not like the print on the fabric, it looks a little blurry. but fits well


The plastic smell was obnoxious. The dress wasn't sewn near the bottom of the zipper and the material was very course. I sent it back.


A bit longer than I expected but that's okay. All I have to do is iron it and it'll be a nice dress. No complaints:)


I got this for a work dinner with my husband and it was nice for the occasion. The material wasn't exactly how I was expecting and it is not as form fitted as it looks in the picture. There really isn't a flow to the skirt so I would recommend a petticoat, which I wore with it. Nice dress over all and very well made.


Great dress for the price! The size chart was accurate and the dress fit exactly as expected. I am 5'9 and usually dresses and skirts are too short for comfort, so it was nice to find something that is actually knee length on me.


Wow! I am so happy with this dress.  I bought black,  red & purple. Fits beautifully,  like it was made just for me.  I also purchased petticoats for all dress colors..makes dress fill out beautifully.


I love this dress! I got so many compliments on it. It does run small through the bust area, but that's an easy fix. I paired it with a crinoline slip, which gave me a true Vintage look.


Nice dress but lint seems to stick all over the dress.


It is a lovely dress and a very vibrate color!


Absolutely beautiful dress and crazy good price.  The quality is much higher than I expected and the cut is pure Hepburn.
