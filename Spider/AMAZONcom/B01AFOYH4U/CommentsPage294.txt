My lady loves it.


Item as described and prompt delivery.


I am 5'4 and 160lbs,.... I used the dress for a KY Derby party. It fit well and was a perfect retro Derby dress.


Dress is beautiful, but the fit was too small.


Love this dress! I followed the measurement chart and the dress fits perfectly. I received so many compliments on this dress and I am definitely going to keep this one in rotation!


Wife bought this dress.  Fits her great, she loves it.


Nice quality


 I loved it!


The dress is too see through


I honestly didn't expect it to be such a great dress, considering the low price. Very happily surprised and recommend!
