Seriously this was a great deal! It fit like a glove. The material was not cheap. I had it dry cleaned and pressed and it turned out beautiful. I am so pleased! This brand would be a great choice for brides maid dresses. Thank you Anni Coco!


Was of good quality but ran a little small so didn't fit my wife


Just didn't like it on me


It did not fit properly. The zipper worked poorly.


Dress bought did not come with pink belt but was lovely worked great for thr wedding I wore it at


The white dress is a little see through. I will need white undergarments. Also, the red belt left a red mark on the dress. I am returning and trying again. Looks great otherwise.


I wan't expecting the dress to be as long as it was and also the top was too loose  when I ordered a medium. Beautiful dress after some alterations.


This dress was perfect for my sister's wedding. It was here on time and the only I had to do was hem it as it was too long for the length required. The normal length is great too! It was comfortable as well. I put a belt with it and thought it made it even cuter!!!


Based on the measurements given it fits snug in the top. I am a 34 d, 30 waist and 5,6. Hits below my knee. Not sure if I should have gotten a bigger size but the bottom is already wide I think I'll just keep it he way it is.


Pretty dress, but I'm a full figured woman, normally an L or XL. I ordered the XXL which was too small. I've been in touch with the Anni Coco company and the response was quick and friendly; I will be returning it sadly as this is the largest that this dress comes in.
