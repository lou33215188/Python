This did not fit as expected


I love it!!!!  Going to a 50th Anniversary party and it is just perfect.


Very beautiful dress


A great fit, the fabric is very nice, and you can't beat the price!. I bought it in two colors.


Looks great  fits well, delivered quickly  Excellent!


Nice dress


It's true to size, but a little larger, which is great because it's easier to take in. Material is different than expected, but nice and light for upcoming summer months.


Love it!  Medium weight material with a bit of stretch so it fits and skirt swings nicely.


Beautiful and flattering dress! Love it


Great fit!! Super cute!!
