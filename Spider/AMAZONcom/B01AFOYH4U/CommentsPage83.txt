Dress runs small and the stitching at the front seam is way off! Oh ya before I forget... by the bottom of the dress doesnâ€™t pleat like the beautifully ruffled picture shows ğŸ™� super bummed!


UPDATE:


I returned this dress over 6 weeks ago along with the matching slip however I still HAVE NOT received my $44.00 back!


Received this dress yesterday and I must say this dress is beautiful. No complaints whatsoever! I ordered a XL (14) and its a little big in the waist area but the flare is perfect since my hips are a little wider. I will be ordering more dresses!


Absolutely gorgeous little dress! I got so many compliments on this dress!!!!! Highly recommended. I will be buying more in different colors.


The shipping was quick - 2 days! - and the dress fits as I hoped it would. It falls just below my knees, so it's definitely work appropriate, but I may have it altered somewhat to be a tad shorter. I don't even need a petticoat, it flares out enough for me where the shape is noticeable. Also, the color is a lovely royal blue. Love this dress!


Beautiful color, beautiful dress!  Make sure you  order by the bust size.  It looks like I went back in time with this dress.  Adding saddle shoes really gives you that 50s feel.


Couldn't ask for a better, more elegant dress! I'm simply in love with this. It's perfect


Went to a concert wearing this 1950s Style dress. Received so many compliments at the 1970's memory concert  on this beautiful dress. Easy to wear and the material is so well-made making the fit so very awesome!


Love it â�¤ my daughter wore it to homecoming
