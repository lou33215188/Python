This dress was too small, but small in a weird place.  It fit fine in the waist.  It wouldn't zip up over my midback/shoulders.  I'm not particularly busty and I never thought my shoulders were that broad.  The dress itself seemed well made and I like the flow of the skirt on it.


This dress was so pretty with good material.  I am a size 12/14. The large fit perfect.  Only problem was a faulty zipper so I sent it back for an exchange.


What a beautiful dress it was perfect for my holiday Party....I only gave it 4 stars I couldn't`t give it 4-3/4 stars as the zipper seemed to be a little finicky....or I am just a whole lot of woman....either way the look, the style, the material....unreal! and I highly recommend purchasing a petticoat to wear underneath.  A LOT of compliments came my way....I wish I had taken a pick but sadly I did not.


I read the reviews saying to get a size bigger. I did and I was disappointed. It was too big. It fits as expected as long as you understand your body size. My only complaint is that the zipper will sometime get off track and the material is cheap. It's exactly what I expected and made a great grad dress.


I ordered this ğŸ‘— at the last minute and I got it before expected and it fits just right. I am so happy with my order


Arrived on time. Good quality for the price. My daughter will enjoy it for many parties to come.


The blue was not as brilliant as the picture shows. I'm not sure what was done to the material (tag states a cotton/spandex blend), but the dress was shiney and almost looked like a vinyl table cloth. My bust measurement was slightly smalller than the listed measurements, however you could still see my bra in the arm hole. Will be returning.


Very disappointed. The stitching in the waistline on the left side of the dress was coming off pretty bad so I had Amazon send a second dress and the same thing was wrong with it. The "design" of the dress was great...with a petticoat underneath. But the quality is cheap.


Beautiful dress. Fabulous quality. Excellent fit. Highly recommend.


The fit is great! Fitted but not tight. Unfortunately the zipper broke the first time I zipped it and it wasn't because I was trying to squeeze in the dress or force the zipper. ğŸ˜¢
