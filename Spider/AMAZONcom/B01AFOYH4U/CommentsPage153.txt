My dream dresses can't wait to order more just don't wear on a windy day felt like Marilyn Monroe but so many races astonishingly beautiful and priced


Received many compliments. Fit very nicely. This is the style of dress that works well on almost any body type. Very flattering and feminine.


I was skeptical about the size, but it's true to the size chart.  This is my new favorite little black dress!!


Really well made. Dress fit as expected. Fabric is heavy but comfortable. You can wear it with or without a petticoat. I can't wait to wear this on my birthday.


Vivid beautiful red dress fitting this size 12 US lady.


Went by the measurements they provided and the back wouldn't close, let alone zip. This dress was easily two sizes too small, which is a shame because it's well made and a stunning color.


I love my dress. It is so hard to find a decent dress that is a good length without showing cleavage. I liked the dress so much that I bought 2 additional dresses.  I love the vintage look!  Check the sizing chart and make sure you choose the correct size, and it will fit nicely.  The dresses are so beautiful and they can be dressed up, or down.  Just perfect!!!


Love the dress. Bought it for my 14 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it. It is not only classy but comfortable especially compared to everything else out there This is the 3rd one I've ordered.


This dress is very pretty, and exactly the style expected.  I'm going to pair it with a red beaded necklace and cute black heels.  It runs slightly small at the shoulders.  If you are borderline on sizing or well endowed, order the larger of the two sizes.


Omg!! This dress is more than I expected!! Fit like a glove! Great quality!! It is a little long but I am 5'3 so that's to be expected!
