It fits perfectly and is gorgeous, but the red sash did not come with it


I'm 5'7" and 170lbs, A-cup and the medium fit perfectly! Just the right amount of stretch and breathable. Perfect for work or events


I am in love.. This dress fits perfectly and it's very flattering. I wore it to a car show and received lots of compliments.


My daughter says it fits perfect


The product fits very nicely and is a great shape, but the material is very shiny leaving it with a cheap, costumey look.
