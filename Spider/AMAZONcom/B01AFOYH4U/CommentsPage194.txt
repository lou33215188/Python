Arrived early and will do well.


The material does not breathe and feels doesn't feel comfortable. Returned this item.


Love this dress! I get so many compliments about it. Fits great and looks great.


Super cute, nice quality material. Great price. Needed to be pressed when arrived, but that was fine.


Color,fit and craftsmanship very good. Material feels more like broadcloth than a cotton/spandex, but hopefully a few washings will soften it up. Overall happy with the purchase.


LOVE IT! Wore it with a petticoat and the red bow. It was the hit of the party, got so many compliments, even from the men. Also is great quality.


I loved the material. The problem I had with the dress was that according to the size chart I should have fit a size XL with a little room to spare. I couldn't close the zipper. It was way too tight in the bust area.


it is beautiful but fit to small


Love the fit and I look great in it


Very ordinary fabric
