I love this dress, the material is soft and thick and it'a little stretchy too.


the fabric stretches and feels nice, it is a basic dress that can be dressed up for an evening out or with a jacket to the office. I bought it in several colors :)


Just be aware that the black dress has a red ribbon. The website makes it look pink!


Good qualitiy and nice fit.  Color is exactly as expected based on picture.


The quality is fine for the price.  Size is coming as expected.  I am happy with this product.


It was too small and I gave it to my daughter and when we tried to take it off, it ripped. ğŸ˜¡ cheaply made, I wish I have never gotten it.


I absolutely love this dress!!! Comfy... flattering... received the blue one and went back for the red and white!!! Ladies... buy buy buys!!! You will love it!!!


It is a gorgeous dress and fits perfectly. I also purchased the petticoat and the flare really adds a dimension of elegance.


We ordered this for a drum major costume. Fits well looks cute. Always looks wrinkled up close. Looks great from afar.


Very cheaply made. Not what i expected.  Would like to return .
