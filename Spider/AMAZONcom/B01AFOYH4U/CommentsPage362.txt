I really like the dress.  It is very comfortable.  Make sure to check the size chart.  It is a most beautiful blue!


Beautiful dress and fits perfectly .


Fits as expected. But is too long for me.


It's is made very well.  Will order from them again


The dress was nice color, feel but it wasn't the right size


The zipper doesn't like to go up past the midseam of the dress and is a but too tight on the torso.


Very impressed with the quality for the price!


Arrived just in time for my daughter's choir concert. Perfect fit.


Nice


This is one of the worst products I have ever bought on Amazon! Absolutely terrible. Almost costume like material
