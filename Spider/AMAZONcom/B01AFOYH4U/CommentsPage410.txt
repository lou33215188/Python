I loved this dress on my daughter. She wore a puffed slip under it. Beautiful.


Didn't fit as I expected. Runs large.


the dress looked nothing like the picture it was too big. im sending it back and will probably never buy any clothing from this site


Nice thick material!


The material is amazing.  I was surprised I could fit the large.  I ordered a black version in an XL and it was quite loose on me. So when I ordered the white version in large It fit perfectly.  I am 5'4 196lbs with DDD bust and it fit great.


I ordered a large since Im top heavy, the dress fits perfectly in the areas that matter.  Just have a little more space in the neck area (but that can be fixed)


This dress fit horribly. It was way too long and the middle seam was too high. I couldn't even zip the dress and I bought the size up. The material is awful. It feels like sand paper. I am very dissappointed with it.


Love, love it have on mustard  nd I order the royal  blue ..gaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwjjjjuuuusssss. ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ™ŒğŸ™ŒğŸ™ŒğŸ™ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


Size M was more like a Large. The bottom hem was falling apart! Not very happy.


Very flattering to my larger bottom half.  (Belly. Butt. Thighs)  Fit firmly on my upper half giving the curve look in just the right places.  I'll be buying this one in other colors.
