Very nice dress, nice material, nice fit, stylish. Happy!


The dress was cute and fit my wife just right. But had a hole where they forgot to sew on the zipper and had a lot of loose strings hanging from the bottom. Contacted the third party seller who told me to mend it myself and refunded me $1.


This dress was a hit, it fit like it was made just for me!


Bought this for my daughter for a wedding. Very beautiful!


Loved this dress! Such a classic got so many compliments.


Super Cute!  Fit well.  Color is like in the photo.  Good quality!


I LOVE THIS DRESS! I didn't wear the sash but it looks good with or without it.


I purchased this dress for my 13 year old daughter.  This is a well made dress and fits beautifully.  Instructions say to hand wash and line dry.  We used the delicate setting on our washer and washed the dress separately. I was amazed to see absolutely no wrinkles in it when we line dried it.  Highly recommend this classic dress.


Snug, but wearable.


I give it only 4 stars, because the dress was way below my knees. I am 5' 4", and it's too long. Otherwise the dress is awesome. Medium fits me well even though in all other stores I'm size small.
