one star cause the zipper broke immediately.  Wish I could give it more cause it was so pretty.  Cheaply made though


Great dress!  The material is nice, has some stretch and the dress is well made. It looked so lovely on my daughter.


This is nice, although a little large in the waist.


Nice!


I LOve IT Nice Dresss Thanks...


I own three of these dresses.  Such Fun prints.  Very comfortable. Refer to the anni coco size chart and you will be good to go. Minuses can't be dried in dryer. Must be ironed every time.


the material was too cheat looking and terrible sewing job


Love it love it...  This is a must have..  You will definitely stand out n a crowd


Bought this for my daughter for an Oscar party. It fit her beautifully and looked so good. She loved it and will definitely wear again.


Great look but did not fit in breast area so I returned.
