I was absolutely satisfied with this dress! It was true to size and fit beautifully! The material was not cheap as I expected due to the low cost. I would purchase again without hesitation. Best $26 spent!


Fits perfect, very well made.  I was a little worried about the size but it fits very well I ordered the 3x and I normally wear between an 18/20 and 22/24.


This a beautiful dress. I used it for a memorial service with a simple pearl necklace. I was comfortable the whole time I wore it and got many compliments.


I have received many compliments on this dress! I love the color and I am looking forward to purchasing it in more patterns and colors. The only downside is that the material was rougher than I expected it to be, but I expect that to pay in the long run as it seems to be a more durable fabric.


Very pretty. Heavier fabric than I expected. It's very comfortable.


Beautiful thick material


Fabric was much nicer than expected (thicker) I went up but too much fabric in the skirt and proportionately wasn't right for me. I could see it being super cute on someone else.... just not me.


Nicely made. Great material.


This dress fits well and looks great. I am 5'6", 135 pounds, and pear shaped. I ordered a small and it fit well. If I were bigger on top, I would've needed a medium.


Love this dress. Fit was spot on. I wear an XL or XXL. I got the XXL and it fit good. I recommend getting the tulle slip to put under it.
