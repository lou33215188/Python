Absolutely beautiful but does wrinkle easily.


Bought it for my neice for Easter.  Very light and classy.


I bought these two dresses for my daughter in law and she loves them.


Great Purchase!!!


I went a size bigger as the the fit was only 70%right. Thankfully I did. Dress looked great but the sash is cheesy it's jut a piece of ribbon and the dress has no loop holes for it so not sure how it will fall when worn.


It was nice wore it for all white day while on vacation...the material was kinda heavy but other then that it was okay..


I was more than pleased with this purchase. It was true to size and a beautiful dress.


Cute dress!  The material was stiff but a beautiful color. The problem is that it was HUGE.  I had to return.


This dress is well made and the material is not cheap and see-thru.  It fits true to size too (I'm a 6 and I ordered a medium). I would say it is a smidge too big. It looks great with a petticoat too.  The only negative that when I wear it with a scarf, it attracts lint like crazy.


Love! Just wish it had pockets
