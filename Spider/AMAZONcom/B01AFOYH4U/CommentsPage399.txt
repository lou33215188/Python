I had been eyeing this dress (among many similar vendors on Amazon) for a while now, thinking that it looked like a good buy.  So I finally purchased this dress for a retro band costume that could also be worn as a day dress.  Sizing for the dress was slightly small, but not too bad (I typically wear an L for the bust, and could have used a XL).  Beyond that problem was the zipper--it couldn't physically zip up!  The cheap plastic zipper wasn't sewn into the back of the dress properly, with stiff facing and enough fabric.  What  this means is when you try to zip, it twists and hangs because the zipper has nothing to hold it flat.  What a disappointment.  If the dress had fit slightly better, I might have kept it and fixed the zipper, but it wasn't worth it.  Ended up returning it.


I would like to say that I have been generally disappointed with the overwhelming flood of cheap Chinese clothing that now dominates Amazon's inventory.


Will Order again
