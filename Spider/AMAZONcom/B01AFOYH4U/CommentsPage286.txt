birthday dress!!!


I love the dress, but it was just a bit too small.


Dress is nice but i had to return because it was too long for me. Other than that, i'd recommend buying it.


Beautiful dress.  Was about 2 sizes too small tho! Very disappointed


It will be a goal dress that hopefully will fit as my weight and health gets better


The material was thin. It had no elasticity, so the zipper kept catching and was hard to go up and down.


Dress was a great fit.


The material of this dress was a little stiff and the top cuts into the throat a little but overall the dress is cute.


Very nice dress, fits well and is flattering.


This dress is beautiful! I tried it on and loved it. The only thing that would make it better is if it had pockets. Flower 6 Is actually a dark blue and grey. I thought it was black but I still love the dress.
