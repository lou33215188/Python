I LOVE this dress! My only critique is that I wish it had belt loops or some other way to keep the belt in place as it's very smooth and moves around as I move. My favorite Prime Day find!


I'm really surprised how much I like this dress.  It fits to size, and the black sash is nice. The fit is awesome...highly recommend it.


This dress was a perfect fit in my size M. At 5'9 34D 130lbs the cut is very flattering and fits exactly in all the right places.


I'll be ordering more from this brand.


No red sash. Whole point was for my daughter to wear for her Christmas performance, and now I need to go shopping anyway, the night before.


Loved it.Wonderful product, quick shipping. It looks very classy and just in time for a job interview.


Omg!!!! It is so beautiful!!! I'm going to get another one in a different color ğŸ˜�


It's perfect! I love it!


I liked the pattern but I have to return it because it reached my ankles.


The dress is a little smaller than expected and the blue is more the color of a very distressed denim than what is shown.  But, overall the dress seems well made and is cute.


Beautiful and nice quality material
