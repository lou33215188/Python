Fit well, the only downside for me was the arm holes seemed a little big. Cute dress, I will definitely order more in the future.


Even though it was somewhat small, the fabric has enough give to make it look good. Love the style and feel of the fabric. Thinking of buying a second one.


Fits great!  Washes well and didn't shrink. Very little maintenance.


Beautiful dress, love the fit and the way it looks.  Can easily be dressed up or down.


Ok


It's a beautiful dress.  Very nice material.


This dress looks so cute on! One of the most flattering dresses I own. Perfect for that pin-up look. I wore it to Disneyland with some Minnie ears and got so many compliments.


BEAUTIFUL dress, love the cut and the feel.


Really cute dress!  The medium was too tight under the arms and the bust, but the large was too much material overall.
