I love this dress, I bought the red, black and blue!


Item runs smaller than size.


I love the 50's design. The fit is beautiful. I love the classic look.


Perfect


Loved the dress. So classic and pretty. I want it in more colors.


This dress is so beautiful on, I ordered an extra large because I have a larger bust, I get so many compliments when I wear other colors but I didn't like this pattern so returned it for a different color.


it was much shorter than i expected but i liked the style and fabric


Everyone liked it


The dress fits perfectly. I'm a 10/12 and the large is just right. I wish it was lined or you offered a slip for it.


Beautiful dress & great quality! I am impressed. I bought an underskirt to keep it round like in the picture and now it really looks like something Grace Kelly would wear. ;)
