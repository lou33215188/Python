Really love this dress!!! Quality is great for the price. My waist and top half are about two sizes smaller than my hips so I probably could have gone down a size but I didnâ€™t want to risk to being too tight. The blue is so vibrant, I cannot wait to wear it out!


Zipper is hard to to get up and cheaply made


I bought this dress in both black and white (same size).  The black fits perfectly, but the white fits a just a little snuggle in the waist.


Love, love, love this dress! I wore it to a work Christmas party and received compliments all night. I bought a petticoat to put under it. *I felt like a princess*


I love this dress!  I love how it fits and the fact that the white isn't too see through.  It's a very classy, comfortable dress and I got a ton of compliments.


Not the same as pictured. Disappointed with this item. This was one of five dresses ordered for my wife for Mother's Day. She decided to keep to give as a gift.


Very cute, I suggest a belt to make this look polished.


Shoulders fit a bit odd (too wide and capped around the neckline). Otherwise, a lovely dress, just an odd neckline fit for me, so I returned it.


I may be long waisted so for me the waist was a little high.  The dress fit well and looked very nice.  It is a hard cotton so does not move as easily as you might hope for a flared skirt.  For the price, this is a great buy.


just as described so cute
