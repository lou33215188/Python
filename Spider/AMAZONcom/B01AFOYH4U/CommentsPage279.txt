Love it!! Exactly like it looks and what I wanted


It fit well but the zipper is a struggle to get up if you donâ€™t have help


Perfect fit! Beautiful twirl for swing dancing, as I had hoped.


I wore this dress yesterday and got so many compliments! Fits perfectly and shipped very quickly. I will be shopping here shortly again


Great quality dress. Has a little stretch to it. I wore it to a wedding with a petticoat and received multiple compliments.


Love it


Dress fit like a glove! Looks and feels great on


Required quite a bit of ironing, but looked beautiful on my daughter for her winter dance.


Dress looks perfect on me!


Fits perfectly.  Nice cool fabric.
