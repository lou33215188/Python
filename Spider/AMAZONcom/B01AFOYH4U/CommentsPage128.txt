Too big. I went off the measurements posted online but this dress was too big in the waist and sleeves and the length is awkward for anyone not 5ft 7 or taller


The pattern is super cute and it was definitely long enough for me (5”9) to be tea length. Had to return it because it was too big. Bummed they don’t have more colours / patterns in xs


The matirial is good but if you were larger you have to buy 2 sizes up i were large i buy 3xLarge it fit practically


For the miney, this is a five star dress. Wasn't expecting much, but my husband and boys were impressed, as was I. Thicker fabric than expected. Lots of structure to the skirt. Red color was spot on. Will buy in another color.


The persob I bought yhe dress for loved it: came to her knees and she is about 5'7. The 2x fit perfect.


Love love LOVE it! Now, it does need a little ironing, but the fabric feels so high quality, and the skirt is so flow-y that I couldn't stop twirling around!!


Runs small. I got a size up and it was small. Unfortunately because it's a nice dress and I had planned on ordering a bunch.


This was my first time wearing a dress in this style and I got a lot of compliments on it. The size was perfect and fit comfortable. I will order another one in a different color on the next occasion.


Great fit very flattering!


The material is like a curtain....not very comfortable.
