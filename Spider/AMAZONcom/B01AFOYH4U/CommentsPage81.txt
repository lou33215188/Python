Best dress ever, fits great, very good fabric and very well made, so many compliments on this dress


It is thick and of good quality! I wore it with a suit jacket because to bring it off, that's what it needed.  Got compliments on it and it just flowed. I am 5 ft. 5 " 190 lbs. 38C bust waist 35.


Seemed like a nice dress, however it was very small in the chest area for me


Was saving this for a special occasion, but had to wear something else because the zipper broke the first time I wore it.  It's a gorgeous dress, and I'm so disappointed that this happened. The size runs as expected, so not an issue of too-small fit; rather the zipper split apart on the lower half and the pull got stuck when I tried to unzip and fix. Not sure that it's worth paying to replace the zipper.


Wife wore the dress to a 50's party and everyone loved it.  She said it was comfortable and got many compliments.


Very cute dress. I ordered an XL but I could have went with a large. I ordered a size up for length/church. I am a size 12 in dresses.


Fits around the waist but doesn't fit around the bust. Way too big for me. The color was exactly as I expected. Will probably take to get it hemmed properly because I hate returning stuff.


I’m giving this 3 stars bc the red sash was placed on top of the dress and now there is a red line down the front :( very disappointing as this dress is very cute


I absolutely love this dress even though it was a little tight. Be advised that this does not run on US sizing so plan accordingly. I wear a 2x US but had to order a 3x and I had to squeeze in the dress with spanx and help lol. I and the dress looked amazing so that's all that matters.


beautiful dress and fits well. I’m 111 lbs and bought a size small. The dress is a bit long and about 1.5 in passed my knee, so I’m going to hem it a bit.
