Great dress though i wished it had pockets


This is a darling dress I had to return it because it wasn't the right style for my great niece but the quality of the dress and the style was very good and the fabric was a high-quality


love the color and the material. could bigger


It was way small. I followed the sizing guide and when it arrived I couldn't zip it up.  Thankfully, it fits my daughter so she will be wearing it.  I will order another in size Medium cause the quality and the price were good.


I will need to order a slip to make it look right.


Wore this dress to a wedding I absolutely loved it. I'll prob purchase more.


Overall, excellent price and true to size. Love the flare of the dress!


Fits like a glove. Very classy. I bought it for my bridal shower. Just had it dry cleaned and can't wait to wear it!


Not true white, has a faint yellow/cream tinge. Trim fit but true to size. Definitely see through so you'll need a slip. Still a nice stiff fabric.


I wear a small, but I liked this dress so much, that I'm going to have a friend do a . little alteration.  But it's a lovely dress!  Fits well and is comfortable.
