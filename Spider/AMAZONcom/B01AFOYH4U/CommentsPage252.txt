Beautiful and fit perfect.


Bought this for our American Heart Association's Red Dress event and it was PERFECT!!!


A little tight in my bust area but all in all it fits pretty good


I am a 34DD and ordered a medium and am happy with the fit.  I will need to steam it before wearing it. I will probably order a second dress in another color after I get an opportunity to wear this one!
