Pretty and fits perfectly


Perfect fit!


I love it. It fits perfectly and comfortable too


Zipper was broken when I received the item.  I had to return it.


Ran a little bit big, but easily solved by putting it in the washer and ironing it :-)


Returning this dress.  Too tight across the chest for me.


I love this dress.  I now own 4 of them and they are extremely flattering.  Don't dry them and steaming them does wonders!


Love Love Love !!!


Really good fit, just a little long for my daughter so we had it hemmed. Color & material are great. We really like it!


Beautiful cut? Recommended!
