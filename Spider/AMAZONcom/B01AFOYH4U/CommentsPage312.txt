Super adorable! I absolutely love this dress! The fabric will wrinkle, but it's nothing an iron can't fix :)


quality material just a but big in the waste


The fabric is a bit ighter than I would have liked, but the dress is cute and I look forward to wearing it soon!

Excellent! Love this dress! Fast delivery! Thank you!


I've returned it but only because it isn't going to work in the production we're doing.  If I were going to wear it myself, I would've kept it.  Nice fabric, color, style and fit.
