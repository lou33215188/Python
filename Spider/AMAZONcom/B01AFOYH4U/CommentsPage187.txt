I bought this dress and 2 others for my Daughter. They fit her well as per the size chart. The dress material is thicker than expected but great quality. She wanted the royal blue but decided to exchange for sky blue. I feel this is a great value.


Sadly, this dress was made with exceptionally thin material. This causes the dress to look cheap. I will be returning it immediately.


Really like this dress.  Fit perfect and great value for its price.  Just dropped it off at the cleaner to get pressed for the wedding I am wearing it to this weekend.


I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and fit.  It's flattering and looks very dressy.


Item arrived on time and as described.


This dress fits perfectly! I wish the material was a bit thicker, but it's absolutely stunning.


it is so cute!! i had to order the bigger one because i have a large bust and a small waist so im going to have it fixed but it is exactly like the picture!! i got a petticoat to go under it and they go perfect together!! just like the picture i love it!!!


I love the style .. the sizes run small


Loved the dress, fits perfect. Very elegant. Makes me feel like a princess. Definitely would recommend and would buy again.


Great Dress. It fit my daughter perfectly. The style, color is quite the fashion statement. She loves the dress. She wore it to church on Easter Sunday and it was a hit.
