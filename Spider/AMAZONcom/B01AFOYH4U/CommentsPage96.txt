I'm average height, weighing around 150 lbs and ordered an XL, but it was just too big. I'm a C in the bust area and this dress was ENOURMOUS in the bust and shoulders and loose in the waist. I don't know who this was made for, but it was just not good. Returned.


The dress fit very well except with the exception of bust. I based my size decision on the chart provided and that the seller said that the sizes run on the small size, but the bust was a couple inches bigger than the size chart said they would be. The length and waist were exactly what I expected. The colors were exactly what I wanted.


My 12 year old daughter absolutely LOVES this dress.  It is cute and not revealing at all.  She likes that it flares when she spins.


I ordered this in red and was so pleased. The color is gorgeous, fit is perfect, and the fabric quality of both the dress and belt was very nice. I received tons of compliments and think this is a week made pretty dress.


This dress is quality... a little longer than expected, but nothing a tailor can handle.


Nice dress, but a little tight at the top, but that is typical for me. I can't wear it, but plan to keep in case I lose a little  weight.


This dress is cute. I really like the royal blue color, it's not as bright as I thought it would be, but that's ok. I'm 5'10", 185lbs, 36-32-46 are my measurements. I ordered the XL and it fits perfectly and falls below my knees.


Love, love, love this dress! Color was true, sizing was as stated, shipping was fast. I adore this dress.


Cutest dress ever. Can't wait to wear it in Vegas.


I should have purchased a small instead of a Medium, I really like it.  It came super wrinkly, I mean super bad that one ironing isn't going to fix it.
