Fit great!


This dress is very, very plain and old looking. I thought it would be a nice blank canvas for Diner En Blac. Absolutely this dress requires too much imagination to bring it to life. I am petite so it was long and looked like I was baptizing children. This may work for being a server at a private party or some other event.  It was jorrible. The material and style are fine but it's so Plain it's lacking everything. Try it for yourself though, if your creative Mayberry you'll like it.


Fits great


The deets: im 5'4, 120lbs, 34b, i ordered a small. It came so fast and i love it! It fit nice but i had it taken in just a tad on each side so it would fit like a glove. Its perfect for any occasion with different accessories.  Love it. 10â˜†'s if i could.


Fits perfectly, great length & good price.


It was very snug for the size


i love the dress, just too small for me. im a 14/16 and i got the XL and i couldnt zipper it at all


I really wanted to love this dress! I am 5'5", 36B, and a size 6 in pants and got a size Medium. I have ordered a floral dress that was similar in shape/size and I must have a weird body shape. It was a little tight for comfort around the chest/armpit area. It was a very nicely made dress, didn't feel cheap. It would have been FABULOUS if it had pockets (but that's bc i love dresses with pockets). If you're slimmer, this dress would probably work well for you. Classic and simplistic, my two favorites!


Gorgeous dress. Really vintage


material is less quality than I expected.
