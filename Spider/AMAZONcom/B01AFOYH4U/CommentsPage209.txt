I was slightly disappointed with this purchase and will return it.  I was excited to try this on when it arrived figuring it would fit well, and unfortunately it was a bit slouchy looking.  Its a beautiful dress or so it looks but did not fit as I expected


I absolutely love this dress it was so comfortable and it made me feel like a classic Beauty


The dress is beautiful, it fit my daughter perfectly, material looks of great quality, very happy with the product and packaging.


Bought it for my wife.  She says it fits 'as expected' and it is flattering for someone of average build.


Such a beautiful dress and I received so many compliments on it!


Was pleased with the fiteam especially the length. A little thin but wasn't see thtough.


I looked like a fat Michelin man. Beautiful if you are slim and small of chest. Not for curvy girls or girls with boobs.


This is a beautiful dress! Well made and fits like a glove and is SO comfy!


Cheap fabric. Definitely not as nice as the pictures.


Love it! So cute!
