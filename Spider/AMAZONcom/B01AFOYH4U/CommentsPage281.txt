I am 5'2" and weigh 110 lbs this dress was huge on me. I order a small.


cute cut but bad fabric. Practically see-through. Fits my top nicely but is quite large in the center. Not fitted at all.


The dress arrived with a broken zipper and I needed it to wear on the following day to a gala with my daughter. I was in tears.


This dress is absolutely beautiful! It fits perfect and the material is wonderful. The dress can be dressed up or worn more casual.


I bought one for each of my granddaughters for a wedding.  They are adorable and look great on them but need to be taken in around the waist as they are too big.


Loved the item, it was exactly what I needed, however it is too small for my needs, but that has nothing to do with the seller or the product.


The dress was beautiful it was just too small for me but a very nice dress


Not the most flattering on me and a bit small.


Love it. Looks just like the picture. The material is great and so is the length. I am 5"8 and it's fits just below my knees.


This dress is beautiful, launders easily, and takes it's shape beautifully when ironed.  I feel I definitely got our moneys worth.
