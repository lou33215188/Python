This dress is amazing! Fits perfectly and looks great.


Very cute!


Picture didnâ€™t do it justice in my opinion and I buy a lot of dresses! LoL


I order this dress in two colors. Both the same size. One fits perfectly. The other not so much. The one that doesn't fit as well is much tighter in the chest and has smaller arm holes.


Order a size larger if you are in between size! Very pretty little dress!


Stretches slightly....you'll probably want a crinoline for maximum fullness and I'd suggest 1 size up for bust accomodation.


We ordered this for my middle schooler and it was perfect - we measured to figure out her size, and the dress was a good fit for her - it looks cute and is comfortable.


Fit beautifully!!! (I'm a size 14 and I ordered the XL). On the other hand  I was very disappointed with the color.  I needed and ordered "white"; this dress is VERY cream. Returning it but since it fit so well, I might order it in another color later. In addition, Ladies, if you order this dress, be very gentle with the zipper.


the dress fit great and look beautiful on me. Everyone loved my Easter dress.


Awesome color and fits well.


I love love love this dress! It's so comfy and fit exactly how it was supposed to. I bought it for a wedding I was going to but couldn't wear it because the material was a little heavy and my plan was to return it because I purchased another dress as well but I just can't return it. I am so excited to find something to wear this to!
