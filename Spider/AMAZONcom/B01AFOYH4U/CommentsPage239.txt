Good fit. I usually wear small and I ordered a small and the fit was perfect and the fabric is good quality


Cute, snug but room to breathe!  So very pleased!!!


Looking forward to wearing this to an upcoming event.  Fits perfect.


Beautiful dress, seemed to be good quality but it was too big.  Based on my size and other reviews I thought I would wear a large but it was too big.


I love this dress!


I like the length and material is thick


LOVE IT!!  It was exactly what I wanted.  Highly recommend.  It fits true to size, so if you want it lose order one size bigger.  A great product for the price.  HAPPY!!


IT DOES NOT STRETCH and is SUPER ITCHY/SCRATCHY. It was meant to be a present, but it was just awful I had to return it upon receiving it.


Absolutely love this dress! Perfect fit! Gorgeous! I will be buying more in different colors and patterns!


It fits well based upon my order.The garment is actually made very small. I normally wear a large, but after trying on someone else's prior order, determined I needed a XXL in this dress.
