Love it


Colors are vibrant, looks just like the picture.


It fit very well, good fabric. My sister wore this dress to a 1960's party, got rave reviews. I ordered one dress for me! Thanks Olga


Gorgeous dress! I love the way it fits and it is very comfortable and breathable.  The fabric is somewhat stretchy so it moves with you which is nice.  I have gotten compliments every single time I have worn it.  I plan on getting more in different colors!


To long


Very flattering dress. The fabric was stretchy and I got lots of compliments on it. I want to buy it in other colors!!


The dress is lovely and pretty well made. I bought a size small, but had to have it taken in an inch on each side. For the price, I am quite happy with what I received.


The fit was awesome .


Neckline comes up a little too high. Runs small.


How fun is this dress! I got it to wear to a wedding I really like it
