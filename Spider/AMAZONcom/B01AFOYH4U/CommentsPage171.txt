IT IS REALLY VERY NICE FITS TRUE TO SIZE I AM BETWEEN 16 AND 18 I HAVE A SMALLER WASTE IN COMPARISON TO MY HIPS AND IT FITS PERFECT


Very nice dress!


I read the reviews that said go up on a size. I did and it fit perfectly. Great material, flows nicely. However the second time wearing it the zipper in the back was broken.


I absolutely LOVE IT! I will be buying more,  I can't wait to wear it out. The fit is just perfect and I really like the quality of the material.


Following the sizing guide it fits well. Im 5'8 and it hit about mid knee which is what I was looking for


Nice fabric. Made well. Perfect invisible zipper in back. I ordered next size up , expecting it to be sized smaller and it fit perfectly. The shirt was fuller than I expected. What a bargain


I bought it as a gift for my mom.  When ordering, it's highly recommended to go by the size chart.  My mom liked the fit --overall she was happy! No issues with the dress at all.  Shipping was too.


Love it! I'm 5'5" 130lbs and ordered the small. It fits perfectly (if you are busty size up). I have worn it with and without a crinoline, and recommend wearing with one. I always get compliments when I wear it. Great buy! Especially for the price.


The material isn't what I expected and I ended up returning it. It looked cute on though.


Beautiful!
