Just read the size chart! Glad I did- almost ordered wrong size. But it fits perfectly according to chart. So classy!


Way to small according to size chart


Shorter than expected.


Dress looks cheap!!!!! Runs really big.  Didn't like this dress at all.


I love this dress.  It fit perfectly and was a great shape for my cosplay!


Love the color and material is nice especially for the price. The dress is a bit long but still looks nice on.


Fits perfectly. Great dress. Can be casual with a belt, or classy with a necklace. Good for most occasions. Definitely suggest this dress.


Cheap material, but it fits well


I ordered the wrong size so I sent dress back & will reorder bigger size


Adorable, classic dress: love it. Got it for a wedding and it was great.
