Loved the dress. Design and color of the dress looks awesome. Fits perfect.


Got this dress for a costume piece. Perfect. Adding rhinestones for some bling! Fits great! Well made and constructed. Stitched well. Fabric is great! Length is great! Perfect retro dress. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. A+


Really nice dress fits perfectly. True to its size, I usually ware a size 16 so I drought an XL. Although I am a bit pregnant it fit beautifully.


Good quality. Vivid colors. Runs big. I'm 4'11 and 115lbs. I got a small but it's loose and too long...about an inch above my ankle.


The dress is plain but adorable! it's extremely easy to add to it and make it a stunner. I added a green sash around the waist, white shoes, and a green pashmina to complete the look for my bridal shower. I would highly recommend this dress!


Loved this dress so pretty. It fit as expected. The material was great quality the seams were great no thread issues. I love the way it fits and how it looks. It was just as described. I love these classic looking dresses and this pattern was just beautiful. :)


Love, love, love this dress! Perfect for my wedding and photo shoot. Received so many compliments.  Great buy!


Fit was good!  I am 5'3 and 190, 38 H bust and it fit beautifully, tiny bit of stretch to the fabric makes it super comforable too!


I'm a typical girl who loves girly stuff. I'm a fan of classy items and this one is a great find. It really looks good on you and you would really stand out compared to others. It also has an excellent quality so you can wear it all day and it's suitable for all occasions.


fits very well and lays well
