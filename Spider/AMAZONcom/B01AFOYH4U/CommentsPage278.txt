Wore this to an outdoor wedding and it was comfortable and received many compliments!.


Love the color and the style.  I purchased this dress to wear to my nieces wedding.  I am going to enjoy wearing this dress!


Beautiful dress....very happy with quality and speed of delivery


Well made, fits great, true to size.


Got lots of compliment! Comfortable.


Fit great but WAY too long!!!!! Went about 4 inches past my knees. I'm 5'4 160 and got a medium. Like the dress so I'm keeping it and just having it hemmed.


Nice fabric, full skirt, perfect for a crinoline!


Beautiful dress but I was a bit disappointed in the material. Very well tailored though but would have been better in line not rained cotton.


I was thrilled to receive this beautiful dress, but the fit is a little large. If you have ample bosom and a small waist, don't hesitate to order a size down. Pair it with some jewelry and nice hair, and you will totally be a sight for sore eyes!


Loved my dress! I just had to order more; 5 more!
