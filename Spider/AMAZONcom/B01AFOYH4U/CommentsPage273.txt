Love these dresses i have almost every color....i compliments everywhere I go


Nice dress, good quality. I like it. Plan on wearing it for my upcoming wedding with a lace shrug.


this is a cute dress for the price but they run small


The material is soft.


Brought it for my aunts fifties party success! Love it


I was expecting the blue to be as bright as it is in the picture, but it is kind of dull. I still love it though and it looks great on!


The fit, material and overall quality is excellent. I ordered size XL and the fit was perfect.  I am a 36DDD, 215 pounds. Slight stretch material. I ordered 3 more dresses from this seller!


This dress is gorgeous!  I'm five feet tall, and a double d in cup size and a size large fits wonderfully!


Good length.  Fits well.  Seems to be well made


It fits for the most part. I am just a little wider in the ribs and it takes more effort to zip up and sit right on me. It will work for the pin up photo shoot with a couple classic cars that I'm doing in the fall for my birthday. I absolutely love the print and hope to enjoy it for a very long time.
