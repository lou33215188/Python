Everything about the dress was fine but the fabric wasn't what I expected.


Perfect! Just what I needed for my Breakfast at Tiffany's Bridal Shower. :)


The material is very stiff.


great dress, good quality, fast shipping.


It's small in the bust.


This dress is just adorable - I love it - fit great and I was actually very supersized with it because it is just adorable - I would recommend this dress hands down!
