Needed a belt  but loved it !


Love the dress true to size


The dress material was awful, it felt like a potato sack and made the dress very uncomfortable to wear.  The dress did not fit well around the arms (too tight and I have arms on the skinny side).  I returned the dress due to my extreme dissatisfaction and I will never purchase another dress from Anni Coco again..


Looks great!


Weird material. Fit nice though.


Was well made and I loved the material. Was beautiful but very tiny.


Material is very heavy(Thick)


Fit perfectly. But it said color is white actually it's off white.


Cute, comfortable dress. However it is a bit longer than expected


Cute, inexpensive but wrinkles very easily.
