When we got it, the fabric was smooth and the design is Beautiful. I have never seen anything like it. It was a gift for my mother and she loves it.


Bought it in blue. It's so beautiful. It's exactly what I hoped, and fit perfectly (I ordered a large, and I'm usually 12-14 in dresses). The fabric has a little stretch (thanks, spandex!), which is great. But definitely iron or hang right out of the dryer, 'cause it wrinkles! 100% satisfied with my purchase.


Okay.  Not bad overall for the price, but the zipper is extremely cheap.  The person I bought it for said they couldn't even put the dress on without worrying about breaking the zipper.


Runs small


The dress is beautiful and the fabric is a nice weight, but I ordered according to the given size measurements and it was much too small. I needed the equivalent of a 16, but it fit my size 10 daughter perfectly.


The waist is a bit smaller than expected but dress is wonderful quality.


Cute dress I'm like a size 12 but I ordered the xxl just to be safe it fits nice but probably could've gotten one size smaller


I ordered the red one for a party. Love it so much, ordering the black one too


I actually really like this dress, it's good quality and very nice. I'm just a little too busty for it.


Very nice material and the belt fabric is nicer than it looks.  Without a petticoat it is a little long for me (5' 2").
