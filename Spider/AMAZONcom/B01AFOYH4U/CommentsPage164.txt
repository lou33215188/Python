I love the fit of this dress. I want to buy it in all the colors.


Beautiful dress but returned bc it was too small in the bust - wouldn't zip.


It is a very heavy cotton material. Bear in mind if you plan to order for summer.


purchased for a friend who was in a play


Very pretty, love the material, but didn't fit. I guess I'm too fat.


I loved this dress. I got many compliments and even sent it to the cleaners to get ready to wear again. When I first got the dress i was worried it was too plain, but once I put that petticoat underneath and paired it with jewelry, a clutch and heels I turned plenty of heads. I will be purchasing this dress in blue as well.


The red sash faded on the dress, and it had a huge red spot on it when I received it, so I had to return it. I didn't want to take a chance of the stain not coming out.


I order the red dress it came earlier than I was expected , nice quality material, dress was exactly like what was shown in the picture I haven't used it as yet worth the price very nice Prefect for me to go to church.


5'3 and 180lb ... bought Xlarge and fits great


It's cute, seems to be good material.  Fit's well because it's a bit stretchy.  I ordered a size up per other reviewer recommendations.  I'd say I am generally a 12, bought an XL and it was just right.
