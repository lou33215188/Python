I really liked the style of this dress, and was excited to get it. Being that UPS likes to play games with packages, I received it later than the Prime promise, and too late for what I needed it for. With that being said, the dress is the fabric of a table cloth, and to me the ends seem undone. I thought the skirt fabric would be a little thicker. The purple color is very nice, the picture is almost spot on, I'm sure that's due to pixelation though. For the price, I can't be too disappointed. Nonetheless, I doing a return.


Using this in believes my bridesmaids dresses. With a petticoat it is super cute. Color is great material is nice. Has slight sheen to it...but isn't shiny. Will be ordering one for me too, my bridesmaids looked so cute and had fun in them. I want one too.


Beautiful dress. I wore it to an  outside wedding at a Winery and got so many compliments (women & men).  I did change the ribbon belt out for a wider stretch type belt. This is my third dress like this! LOVE THEM


A cute dress. Didn't think the sash worked with the dress though, so I removed it.


I get compliments all the time in this dress however I have DD cups, and it was just a tad bit tight across the chest, but not uncomfortable.


Fit was perfect.color perfect. Would buy another!


This is one of my favorite dresses that I have ordered off of amazon.  The pictures online don't do it justice.  I feel like I belong on "desperate housewives" when I wear it. Loveeee this dress.


The dress is well made and fit like a glove! I added a petticoat and it turned into something really special. I've worn it twice and love it! I added a picture of how I wore it for a dress up day at work.


Great quality, fits as expected and wears very nice. I can wear this to work outings or formal parties. Love it


This dress fell apart at the zipper the first time I wore it, but it was after the return window because I'd saved it for Easter.  Very disappointed.
