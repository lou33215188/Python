We had a throw back 50's party and this was perfect!


t is beautiful ans stylist.


Absolutely darling! Bought this for my daughter for her 8th grade promotion and it was perfect!


This fits perfect and looks great on.


Wore this to a wedding and got lots of compliments. Fantastic dress for the price!


I love this dress!!  I knew from other reviews that


it runs small so I ordered the XL. I'm 5"3 size 14.


I will be ordering one in every color!


I love the style of the dress. I ordered lg. however, it is snug across the bust line; (38D)..Had I gotten an xl., the dress would have been too big..


Love it! Fits like a charm!


Great dress! A little long and the zipper sticks, but otherwise it fits great!


Really pretty
