Fits nicely, fabric is very nice and price is amazing!  I can't wait to wear it to a friends wedding.


I wish it was a little shorter


The dress is beautiful and fits perfectly. Would order every style


Love the dress


Great dress! Well made for the price, looks very nice, comfortable, and very fun to spin in!


I love this dress!  It's very comfortable and flattering to all figure types. It runs small so I had to order it two sizes larger than usual but it was worth it. I received tons of compliments when I wore it.


Pretty dress for daughter who plays in an orchestra.


Loved everything about this dress..


I purchased this dress for a dinner and I was very pleased with the fit.  I purchased something similar earlier and wasted my money.  This Anni Coco dress was of a MUCH better quality for only $5 more.  It looked very elegant on, and I'm very happy I purchased it.  I usually wear a size 8, so a small was a very close fit.  I think though, the dress looked better a little tight than too loose, so I'm glad I bought a size small.  As other reviewers have said, it's a great dress!


The waist and collar are much higher than expected, so it didn't fit well.  Not small, really, just not a good fit.  I've returned it.
