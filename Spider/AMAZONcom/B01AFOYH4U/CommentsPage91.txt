The dress came quickly and fits true to size.  The cut is flattering for many different body shapes.  I would have liked the material to have been higher quality--maybe a polished cotton or better cotton/poly blend.  The dress is not lined and the stitching is "okay" but not polished. However,  I will certainly enjoy this dress as a casual summer dress.


I am disappointed with this dress. The dress was soiled with brown face powder and the satin belt was missing in my package. If it was not so costly to return this item I would have immediately. The material was good quality.


This dress is so beautiful got lost of compliments on it.


Weird material. Wasn't impressed.  I returned for a full refund.


This is a great dress! I got it for a costume party and received many compliments


Dress is so nice I may likelh wear on other occasions.


I'm 250 lbs and 5' 11" and a size 2X for me very well. However, I wish the dress was made out of a different material since it wrinkles extremely easily and is very warm. According to my understanding of the wash/dry care tag, the material isn't sutible for a dryer which means thy I need to spend about an hour ironing it when it wrinkles just from being hung up in my closet.


Wish it had a liner in it but it's beautiful


Classy & Comfortable. I bought this dress because I don't have a funeral dress. Now I'm set. If I have to attend a funeral or other formal meeting, I won't feel ridiculous and uncomfortable.


This dress has a beautiful print. The fabric is durable and has a nice weight. It does need to be ironed before wearing.


This dress was perfect. My daughter is very conservative and she likes things cut very classic. Because she's a classic Beauty. The dress was exactly as described the blue was a beautiful Rich color. The fit was superb we love this dress thanks for Designing it it was amazing.
