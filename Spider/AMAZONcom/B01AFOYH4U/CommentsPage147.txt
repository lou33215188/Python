The dress is lovely, though the size chart could. E a little more accurate. I wear a 36 D bra and ordered a size L. It's a little snug trough the chest and bodice. I haven't actually worn it yet, but I'm hoping it will give some while wearing it.


This dress fit perfectly! I was a little nervous ordering this dress but let me tell you, it was an absolute steal! I used this for my engagement photo-shoot and it look and fit PERFECTLY. In fact, so perfectly, that I will be ordering this in another color next paycheck.


Love it...


Very nice dress. Good material. Fits perfectly. Just follow the measurements. Pick the ones that are  closest  to your reading and you'll be fine...sizes will throw you off..


Needed a white dress for my daughter to page.  It was great!


In love ğŸ˜� With this dress ğŸ‘— â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�


Great quality and just Adorable...


I bought this in red, very nice, vivid color and nice material. Although I used starch, it was easy to iron, not like some cotton dresses that take forever to get wrinkles out. I got many compliments!


I brought the Royal Blue and the Black and I must say they a BEAUTIFUL. They fit true to size, arrived on time, were nicely packaged. I am VERY HAPPY with this purchase and will be ordering more.


Loved it ğŸ˜� And get the petticoat to go under it so it won't be flat
