This is an adorable dress for any occasion. I ordered an XL by going off the reviews and size chart and it was a bit too big but still worked out great. Next one I order will be a large which should be true to my size.


So perfect!!! A little tight in the chest area but overall, couldn't be happier.


Very cute dress.  I love the style and color. The material is interesting/different kind of feel to it.  Not stiff, but not soft.  It comes with a belt (ribbon), but it doesn't have belt loops to keep the belt in place.  I  don't like that.


Exactly what I wanted.  I'm 5'4 and 155 pounds and ordered a medium.  Fits perfectly and looks adorable with a petticoat


LOVE this dress!!! Fits great


I made to purchase for a young entering high school. I thought a plain black dress should be a staple in a young lady's closet. It is perfect. It can be dressed up with a rhinestone belt, ribbon around the waist or a pair of kitten heals ; or dressed down with a pair of ballerinas.


Beautiful, and comfy! Its a nice length, about halfway down my calf(I'm 5ft2in.) Super flattering. Wore it as a bridesmaid for a wedding. I have a few copies of this dress in many colors. IMA definetly purchase again


I love this dress!!  I usually wear between 8 and 10 dress, I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. This dress even came with a red sash, so u can wear all black or jazz it up a little and accessorize with red.


It was a little snug but still loved it. It was breazy, so I put a blouse(also purchased here) underneath. Loved the way it looked. I ordered another dress just one size up


I bought this to wear to a wedding. It's very pretty and the fit is perfect. The right accessories really make it pop. I will probably order again in different colors
