You get what you pay for! The red ribbon included with my white dress stained the dress. When I opened up the package the ribbon was laying on the dress itself, so now thereâ€™s a red stain down the front. Also the threading is coming undone. I JUST opened this package and I am not happy.


Great bridesmaid dress. You cannot do better for the value! Really cute with the petticoat underneath. It fit perfectly, needed to be pressed and didn't look cheap even though it is! I could not do better than this at david's bridal for the price. Was just in a wedding with a $380 dress which was magenta and to the floor. Will never use that again. This little number is fantastic for dancing and any occasion, no one will know what you paid for it!


OK, so I do not actually know if the product was too large: I was not able to get the dress on and fitted. The zipper was sewn together with one thread out of the channel so it was impossible to zip it up. This is completely unacceptable. It was obviously not inspected before being packaged. I ordered it for a wedding and, from all other appearances, it would have been a perfect choice and worth the money. As it was, I had to return it and find something else to wear to the event.


These dresses are awesome! So cute, with comfortable, high-quality fabric. I bought 2 for my 17-year old daughter along with the under skirt that was suggested. She loves them. She is 5'6, 115 lbs and wears an XS or S, so choosing the size was tough. The XS was perfect, except that it was a little tight around the arms--my daughter has broad shoulders. So, in her case, the S was right. The waist is a little looser, but the fabric hangs so well that you can err a little either way.


I would definitely recommend this dress!! I received many compliments on it as well, & will be buying more in the future. I'm 5'6 & weigh about 195 pounds and bought the XL, it was close in the breast area so i will go up a size just because of that. Everywhere else fitted perfect, I also wore a petticoat under it to add a fuller flare, but it can be worn without one.


Looooove this dress!!! Perfect for the 1950s/ Havana Night event I'll be attending in a few weeks! I purchased a medium and it fit perfectly (I am 5'1, 34DD and 128lbs with a little belly pouchğŸ˜�) The pattern gives the illusion that it's embroidered and I like that! Love the neckline and how it cinches my waistline because the whole dress is quite flattering on meğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼ Adding a petticoat will make it look more amazing!


This dress is amazing! I was hesitant to purchase a dress on line without actually being able to try it on, but the measurements and fit are true to size. I absolutely love it. The colors are bright and vibrant. I wear a petticoat underneath, to give a more vintage look and feel. You could wear it without a petticoat, but it gives a little bit extra volume. The only drawback is the sash is not attached to the dress, nor are there any belt loops. This cause the satin sash to shift as you wear it, but a quick glance and slight adjustment as it creeps around is all you need to do to put it right.


I haven't worn it yet because I was waiting on a black petticoat. But the dress is beautiful the red is Red and the fabric is awesome it is cotton with a little stretch but for the price this dress looks like it came from a designer dress shop I am so glad I bought it it is fitted on top and the flare is perfect great product and I will be purchasing more dresses from anni coco !!


This is a super cute dress. It's very figure flattering. I received a lot of compliments on it. I debated whether or not to get a crinoline and didn't get one. I like it without but think it would still be really nice with one to change the look. My only complaint about the dress is, it doesn't have any loops to hold the ribbon in place. I would definitely recommend purchasing this dress.


this dress is adorable! i typically wear size large or 10 in women's dresses, but i took the advice of others & ordered xl..had to take it to my seamstress to take it in, but now it fits like it was made for me! fabulous dress!
