My daughter loved this dress and looked so pretty in it only setback is the pleats after you wash it they are gone and i am having a difficult time trying to to do over other than that we love this dress!


Love it!!!It fits great I wear a size 14-16 ordered the 2x and it is a great fit!!!


I have multiple of these dresses and they are wonderful! Fit wonderfully, holds up very well when washed. Recommendation if you are looking to order one is to have someone measure you and use the size chart to get the best fit for you. These are wonderful on any body type no matter how small or large, a very classic lady like dress!

I really needed something to where to my co-worker wedding. I went to the mall I didn't she anything. I found this dress on Amazon it had great reviews so I purchased 2. Blue and black both dresses are really nice. I love the material I received many compliments. I felt gorgeous.


Love this dress!! Works even better when you get a petticoat underneath!!!


I bought this for my wedding and it fit perfectly! I ordered an XL since that's the size I usually buy and it fit like a glove! I love this dress!


Such a cute and flattering dress for all pear-shaped girls. Accentuates the positive and conceals the challenges. I recommend.


THIS DRESS WAS TOO WIDE FOR ME AND I DID NOT LIKE THE MATERIAL.
