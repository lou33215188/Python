This dress is very pretty and made with decent quality fabric.  It's not too heavy and has the perfect amount of stretch in it.


COLOR:  I needed a WHITE dress for an event; however, this "white" is actually off-white/cream/egg shell.  I chose a different dress to wear to the event, but will exchange this one for a different color.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the transluscent-ness (I know that's not a word, but I'm going with it) of the "white" fabric.  Perhaps that's common with white; I don't know.  I'm thinking it needed to have been lined, but a slip can be worn to solve that problem, so no big deal.


SIZING:  I originally ordered XXL, based on the Vendor's sizing chart instead of Amazon's (44" bust/ 36" waist).  It ended up being too big, so I ordered the XL.  They're both going back, but I'll be ordering a different color soon (the other colors look prettier on pictures than the "white" does in person).

I finally ordered this dress in CLASSY BLUE (the darker/royal blue).  ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!  The color is VERY VIBRANT and looks 100 times better than the white one (which happened to be a dull and not bright white).  I am extremely happy with my purchase and will be on the lookout for more dresses made by Anni Coco.


Love this dress and the material!!!


Beautiful dress right size arrived on time thanks
