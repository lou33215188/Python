Very happy with my dress, fit excellently and made me look fabulous. The skirt lengths was a tad short on my 5'10" frame, but that's an inherent hazard.


I bought this for my wife and it fit her perfectly, she is very happy and so am I she is VERY SEXY is the new dress!

Fits perfect and arrive fast


Great dress, worked well for my charity fundraiser! Received many compliments! Needs to be heavily ironed before wearing, but I read teh reviews and ordered based on that, Couldve sized down but deffinetly worked.


This dress is comfortable, incredibly flattering, and fits perfectly. I couldn't have lucked out on a better work dress.


Really nice for the price!!  I ordered this for a costume but it's way too nice to write on!  Lol. I will be ordering more colors!!


I'm hippy with a small waist ,and this dress does the trick!


Great for any occasion,Dressy or casual. Will purchase another one in a darker color to balance my wardrobe.


I'm usually a 10/12 but the 12/14 fits perfect and is very comfortable!! Love it!! I am happy with the purchase. It's hard to find nice affordable dresses. Thank you!


Beautiful dress, longer than expected though.


I bought this for my fiancee - she likes it.
