I ordered a small because I wear a 6P or a 4 and could not get it zipped all the way, this was for a sorority initiation and we decided to go with another dress because one of the ladies could not fit this particular dress.


Great dress for the price however the zipper broke the first time I wore it.  Such a shame as it seems like a great dress for the price.  I like it enough I may bet it fixed.


I liked the dress and it fit well, but was more shear than I expected. Definitely requires a slip


Cute dress. It fits as expected. It came very wrinkled though. The fabric isnâ€™t soft and will wrinkle easily.


My daughter loved all her dresses that I got her, she says. They fit true to size which is a 12 for her.


Will definitely be buying her more !


I guess it is a nice dress... just not for me!


Ran little smaller than expected so I returned and got next size up.


I bought this to wear to a wedding and received many compliments! It is beautiful and fit me perfectly.


This dress is amazing! I bought it for 50's edition of Fab Friday! I normally wear a 28 to 29 Jean in the waist so the medium fit perfectly.  I bought a petticoat for a little fluff. You will not be disappointed with this dress.  It arrived on time and look just like the picture.  I am very pleased with my purchase.


Cute cute dress. Well made.
