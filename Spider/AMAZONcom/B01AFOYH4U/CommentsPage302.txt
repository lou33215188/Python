It was a pretty dress but didnâ€™t fit well because it ran small


great item will buy again from seller


Very pretty, but the small side zipper does not help in getting the dress on and off.


Love this dress fabulous fabric, perfect length and fits exactly like I wanted....very happy with this purchase.


Love the dress and it fits great but they didn't send the red belt with it that is shown in picture.


This dress is exactly what I was looking for. I wear a US size 16-18 and ordered the 3x. The fabric is a light stretchy cotton. Can't wait to wear it.


This is a beautiful dress. I got this for my mom and she loves it!


The dress was plain and simple but perfect.


It was a little snug in the bust area but I expected that. Very nice dress.


The dress is absolutely beautiful. You feel vintage wonderful in it. Great value for the price.


But... when I recieved this dress, it seemed as though it had a tear in it that was sewn into it. Disappointed in the seller. Luckily in the way the dress falls, it isnt noticeable. Buyers should be aware.


Beautiful dress...
