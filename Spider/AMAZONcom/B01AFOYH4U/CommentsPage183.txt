I went to put the dress on.  It is not flattering at all.  The zipper hardly worked to zip it up.  The fabric is like trying to wear a sheet as a dress.  I was not impressed with this dress.  I would love to return it, but can't find my invoice or the bag it came in.


I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas gift. The dress fit perfectly and looked amazing. The packaging was good as well, and the dress arrived early. She was able to hang it up and with light ironing it was ready to wear the next day. She received many compliments on the dress.


The zipper was broking on this dress I was very disappointed it was like they saw it was broking and send it anyway,


Got so many compliments on this dress - wore w a petocoat


I really liked the dress. I would absolutely order from them again.


Followed the reviews and ordered a bigger size. :-( Now my dress is too big - Will get it adjusted locally. The material quality is very good though and  was shipped and delivered quickly. Would recommend.


Very cute. I love this dress so much. I would order again.


I LOVE this dress!!  It is very well made, fit me perfectly (accurate with the sizing chart), and it is very comfortable!  The blue is so brilliant, and I got so many compliments on it.  I want to buy it in other colors.  Just love it!


Wearing it as we speak to a Breakfast at tiffanys baby shower. Everyone loves it.


The fit is mostly as I expected. The waist is the only place where the fit is just a little more tapered than I anticipated. Otherwise, I love this dress. It's my first of this style but not the last.
