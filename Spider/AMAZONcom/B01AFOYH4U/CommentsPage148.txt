Such an amazing and beautiful dress!! I would most definitely recommend it and I will be buying more in other colors!


Looks like a maids uniform and it's WAY too small.  It's a rough, starchy material and reminds of a costume.  I bought this for a semi-formal event and it was all wrong.


Although I did not have a problem with the actual size, I had a problem with the proportions of the dress: the shoulders are extremely wide, making the neckline look weird. The quality of the fabric is not the best, and the polka dots are bigger than the ones in the picture. In the end the dress looked more like a Minnie Mouse costume than a 50's style dress, so I decided to return it.


It fits perfectly!!  Very true to size.  If busty, go up a size.  Thick material and beautifully made!!  Classic dress!! I would definitely buy from this seller again!!  Thank you!!


It is so cute on even a over weight 56yr old.


Same as the picture and looks very nice. Love it.


It was longer than I anticipated and I just felt like I was wearing a curtain. Did not care for the material.


The dress arrived quickly.  It  is  absolutely beautiful!  The material is  just  right for the cut of the dress and  it falls very nicely over the slip  we bought.  White beads, "diamond" and bead bracelet, and sparkley headband  made the perfect homecoming dress.


Really a beautiful dress. It fits well and falls really nicely. I am relatively tall, so I was worried about length, but it is really quite modest.


I would caution buyers that the white is a bit transparent, so a slip and/or nude-colored undergarments are in order.


Got as a gift for a friend and it fit so perfectly. The material is not cheap looking as I was a little afraid of since I donâ€™t like ordering clothes without trying on. I will be getting one or two for my self
