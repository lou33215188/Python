I bought the XL, because I am short, but not small.  However, the dress is too small in the bust. I am a 38C, and I can't even get the dress zipped. I'm not returning it, because, maybe someday...


I turned it into an art dress with wearable paint, but fit is excellent. Not as opaque as I'd like.


I got about a size up or so, and it fit fantastically.


I like it but it feels like a bed sheet


Also the way it was packaged was dissappointing, the bag was entirely too small for it and now it has deep-set wrinkles I have to get out before wearing it. Other than that it is a great dress.... fits as expected; I got XXL, definitely do not go a size smaller, get your actual size.


The material is of great quality! I feel elegant and regal! It makes me feel classic and the color was spot on!


Cute but lots loose stitching didnâ€™t come with bow


Fabirc looked cheap and shiny. The for was odd and the seam ran down the front of the dress. Returned. Blue with flowers.


I love the looks of this dress,  the color combination,


Very nice but to small and neckline uncomfortable. It is cut to high. Too bad


Love the dress! Wish I had ordered it more to my size. I was reading a few reviews that said it runs small so I decide to order it a size bigger. Truth was it pretty much runs true to size. It looked ok on me but would have looked much better in a smaller size. It's not the dresses fault..LOL I intend on purchasing another. The fabric was nice and comfortable. It can be dressed up or down.
