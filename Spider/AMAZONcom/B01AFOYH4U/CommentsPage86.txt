The dress was super cute and I was excited to get it! I followed the sizing guide and it fit as expected. The problem was, when I went to try the dress on the zipper got stuck at the seam and would not move up or down. I had to send the dress back because the zipper made it impossible to wear. Wish it would have worked because I loved the cut and it would have been very cute.


Loved this dress, great material fit as described. I usually don't write reviews but I needed this particular color for my Nephews weddimg. Will definitely suggest this dress. Will be ordering it in a different color.


The white dress arrived stained. The red ribbon included with the dress stained the dress. We ordered 6 dresses. They all arrived stained. And to top it off, it's a "no dry cleaning" dress. ☹


Bought a size larger as stated in the reviews. one of 3 different colors. all were slightly off in size. none fit. I wear a large and ordered an xl and 2 xxl figuring it could be taken in. nope. the bust barely goes over my 180 pound 36 c frame. once zipped your almost to scared to move for fear of ripping out of it. Sad to. this was a beautiful dress.


This is a lovely dress. The material is like a thin stretchy canvas. I'm a tall girl so I wish the waist was a few inches longer before it flared out, but I don't think anyone noticed this other than me. It travels, washes and dries well too .I'd buy a few more if the waist was longer.


Looks great, material is a bit thin, but otherwise beautiful dress


Love this dress!! Buying more!! Can't wait to see it with a petticoat! You can dress it up or down


Returned. My granddaughter didn’t like the color when it came.


It was perfect for the event. The dress was made of a heavy cotton and this eliminates the need of a slip. The color was "Kleenex" white and the fit was perfect for a person with heavier hips and thighs and a smaller waist.


The dress is nice, but the material is poor quality and stiff
