Love the dress.


Love the color but I should of order a smaller size


perfect classic black dress


I didn't like the material


Beautiful dress, fits like a dream! Many compliments!


Beautiful dress. Made well. But cut very small.


I love the way it looks on me


Fits nice


This dress fits beautifully,  very flattering! I'm 5'7, 125lbs with 32 D bra size. I got a small. My only issue with it is the fabric...cotton, a bit thin and wrinkles like crazy. I found the exact same dress with more of a blend of fabrics and more solidly made for less money. Unfortunately i am returning this dress. The design and cut are great though!


this was not a very high quality dress and fit to small
