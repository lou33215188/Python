Great dress, quality and price!  Smooth transaction.


Love this dress, its a little long for me im 5'2 128lbs & i got a small, with a petticoat it looks better but still a little long on me.


The fit is very good - I ordered the small (I usually wear a size 4).  The dress was very wrinkled, and I ironed it according to the label instructions, but it still has wrinkles, so I'm going to try ironing it again, on higher heat.


Absolutely stunning. I love the material and fit of this dress. Wore it for graduation and had many compliments.


Excellent!!! Just what I hoped for and more.I am very pleased and so glad to have chosen this dress. Will definitely order more soon!!


Love the dresses. The materials are a little thick and thats good because you dont need a slip.


Very pretty.  A lady's  dress.


Very poor quality. The seams were barely stitched and the print didn't line up. Material felt cheap. Waaaay too small.


Its very Beautiful. The size is very small. My size in dress is 12. I buy size XL. Its good for me. I like so much because very fancy and elegant.


The perfect dress!  The fabric is a bit stiff and wrinkles easily, but as long as you hang it before, most of the wrinkles from shipping will work themselves out. Very flattering dress for the cost!
