I purchased this for a "50's" night on a cruise.  Everyone loved it.  I got so many compliments!  I bought the red petticoat as well.  Will where this again.  Really is a beautiful dress.


I love, love this dress. I bought it for a Kentucky Derby theme bridal shower and everyone loved it. I may buy another in a different color.


Gorgeous dress. Totally retro.


Perfect style and I love the color


Great dress. What a flare it has on it!


Great for a costume piece...looks a little cheap (Seam issues) but for a simple red dress it's nice


This is absolutely my most favorite, best dress! A little snug but nothing a small fast can't fix.


I love this dress!


I just received this dress and I was absolutely impressed. The colors in the dress was bright and vibrant. The quality was better than I expected especially for the price of the dress.  The dress fits me very nicely! I am looking forward to making future purchases from Anni Coco again!


I'm a 16/18 and ordered XXL and it fits great!
