a very simple and cute dress


As much as I like vintage cuts, this one was too large for me (5'8" 110lbs size zero). Also, I think it would look better in a print, as a solid color seemed too much fabric.


This dress is beautiful. I bought it for a Gala and thought the material would be a little fancier but found that the cotton was really nice. It lays nicely and paired with a pair of red glossy pumps, it was awesome! Fits pretty true to size. I am 5'4 145 and it was fitted in the chest but not snug.


I ordered a large rather then a medium, based on other reviews. I'm glad I did.


Soft material, fits just right.  I'm 5' 4 " about 128 lbs fits perfectly love it.


This dress fits like it was made for me. I wear a size 6 so I ordered a medium and when it arrived I couldn't wait to try it on. I am very impressed with the fit and quality of the material. I ended up getting a petticoat just to give it that extra lift. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.


Dress was super cute, but I didn't get to wear it because the zipper broke when I tried to put it on! Fortunately I had another dress to wear as a backup but I was super bummed! I would be willing to try it again though!


The dress fits properly and is good for the price. However, it did not come with the ribbon belt. Instead, it came with a thin leather belt that detracts from the visual appeal of the dress.


I did not expect this from Amazon.


If you are questioning buying this dress, just do it!  It is absolutely adorable and so comfortable


Great!  Great fabric for hotter months.  Can dress up/down.
