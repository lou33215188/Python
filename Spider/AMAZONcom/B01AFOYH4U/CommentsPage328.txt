Very pretty color. Fits great.


Fabric on the zipper not sewn correctly leaving a small hole. This will evidently cause more damage to the dress if not fixed before wearing.


I have ordered this dress in both white and black! The sizing is accurate and the dress fits well. It is a very simple but elegant dress for any occasion!


Cute, and comfortable. Just wore it to a summer wedding.


My daughter love it. Thanks


Ordered size based on reviews and it was too big. I know my size and review sizing charts so read those and take all reviews with a grain of salt.


Too see through and was really big


Love love the dress $


Beautiful dress  wore it work.


Great dress for my holiday party
