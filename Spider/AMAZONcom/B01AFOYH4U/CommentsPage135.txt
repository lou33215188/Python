Way too small. At least 4 inches smaller. I am regularly an 18/20 and that's the size I bought. I couldn't get it on. I gave it to my friend who is a size 12 and it fit her perfectly. I didn't return it because she is going to keep it, but it wasn't even close to correct sizing for me.


Got this dress for my mom and she loved it. The dress fit perfectly. No need for any adjustments.


Size is really small, and not made for anyone with a larger than B cup. I purchased an XXL because I have boobs and it was made for flat chested  women. Even put it on backwards to see if I could zip it up and it fit flat against my back. Gave it to a smaller friend with boobs, wouldn't fit her either.


I really like this dress. The only thing is that the material is kind of rough in texture. It doesn't drape very well but I suspect that after a few washes it will become softer. It fits perfectly and I'd consider it true to size. I love the style.


Love the dress, super cute. Thinking about getting another one in a different color


I ordered bigger than the size chart said I would wear and I can't even get this over my head... I need to return it... maybe Asian sizes... cute dress, but not worth the hassle of returning it... :(


I love this dress! I wore it to a cocktail party and it was stunning. I am 5' 11" and it was the appropriate length! The petticoat really made this dress amazing! I suggest ordering a petticoat with this dress!


Great fit


Dre$s fits ok. Has a wide bottom an top could've been a liitle tighter. Oyhan than that beautiful dre$s good thick material.


So beautiful in person! Fabric is stretchy and runs large. Chart shows I should have ordered an XL but I bought a Large and fits perfect!
