This dress exceeded my expectations. I received so many compliments. I am in love with this dress and may just order it in every color. By the way, adding a petticoat underneath took this dress to another level.


The dress was a little tight in the bust, but fit perfect everywhere else.


If you are big chested, this dress is NOT for you. I love this dress,  but it is waaay too tight in the chest area. Total bummer. :(


Dress is beautiful. It's perfect! I ordered the Royal Blue and it is gorgeous! For reference, I am a size 6-8, 140-145lb, 5'8", 36B and medium fit perfect. The skirt is swishy and full even without a petticoat. I love it so much I'm ordering it in other colors!


I bought a XXL and I am a 14. It was almost an exact fit. I am large on top and it was roomy so for an average busted person XL would be good. Easy to dress up! Great dress for great price.


I was hesitant to buy this dress because of the price, but I decided to try it. Best decision ever! I love this dress, and I get compliments on it every time I wear it. I wear it with a petticoat and it looks amazing! Fabric is a high quality and overall the dress looks beautiful!


My wife wore this to a 50â€™s dance. She looked fantastic, and got many compliments


This dress is extremely pretty and comfortable, not to mention figure flattering.


nice fabric. will need to iron. heavy fabric, but I like that quality.


My daughter loves this dress.
