looked great. fit was great. loved it.


Dress was nice but the zipper is not a good quality. I was wearing the dress for the first time in thanksgiving dinner and the dress was a little big 30 after the zipper totally open I was so in barest not with buying.


I purchased this as a gift for my mother. It fit perfectly. The color is as shown. It flows beautifully on her. Will buy from this company again.


really great quality and  very beautiful and the bust fit perfectly but being 5'2 i guess its too short and the length of skirt was past my calf down to my ankles


I love this dress!  I am 5'9 and usually wear a medium.  I am busty and hourglass shaped.  I got a medium and it fit beautifully.  It hits me at my knee. I also wear a pink petticoat under it.  Buy it!!!


Perfect fit


The dress fits perfectly! It arrived in a timely manner. My only complaint could be that it was very wrinkly when I opened it, but that is nothing an iron can't fix! I bought it for my wedding rehearsal night next month and I am excited to wear it!


Beautiful dress, just too tight for me.  Style and pattern were very cute and dress was well made.  Sorry I have to return.


I love this dress! Fits perfectly, the color is stunning. It is dressy enough for a fancy wedding (with the right accessories) and can also be casual enough to wear to work. Be ready for lots and lots of compliments!


Amazing !!! However, I ordered it in what appeared to be a marmalade color, but it came in yellow. Make sure you check the text rather than just the picture. Aside from that, the dress fit me well.  I ordered a 2X where I normal wear a large or xlarge, but just to be on the safe side. The dress didnt appear too big and I still had enough space.
