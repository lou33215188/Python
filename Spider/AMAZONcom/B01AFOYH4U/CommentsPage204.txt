Great dress for a great price. The packaging/shipping left a lot of wrinkles. I assume I could have ironed them myself, but I had it dry cleaned and it looks absolutely wonderful!


Perfect fit. An amazing find, the material quality is exceptional. Great value for the money.


Excellent quality


Fabric was strange... plastic / spandex like. Felt cheap. Ran very small.


Love, love, love this dress.  I got so many compliments when I wore it. I got the petticoat under it and it was perfect.


I love this dress, i've worn it for 2 weddings and it's adorable paired with a petticoat. I ordered my exact size and it fit perfectly.


LOVE this!!  Well made.  Nice material.  Very happy.


Classic fit. Great quality and comfy


I did have to hem it as I am 5'1". I have a large B cup bust and weigh 180 pounds. Bust and waist fit fine. This dress was very flattering on my weird shape :)


Absolutely adorable! I am usually an XL, but bought a XXL just in case and it fits like a dream. The XL would have been too small in the top as a D cup.
