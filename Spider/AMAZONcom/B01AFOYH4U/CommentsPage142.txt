Super cute but was smaller than advertised.  Returned.


I bought this dress to wear to church for Christmas program, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with how well it fit. I must say it was beautiful and flowy as I really wanted it to be.


Love the dress. It has become my quick go to Black dress, especially with a petticoat underneath.


With several washings the fabric is starting to pill/fuzz...


Absolutely beautiful!


Pretty flowing fabric, washed and hang to dry expecting it to be very wrinkled, but I was wrong. It even could get away without ironing. Top could is slighlty short, but it is a common problem with deresses. I am 5'10 and 170 lbs.


Got it within 2 days and it looks gorgeous!


Bought the normal size dress for the person wearing it. Received a huge oversized curtain shaped like a dress. Put it directly in the give away pile.


It's beautiful ğŸ˜�!!


beautiful dress


Perfect fit!. I'm 5'6 184lbs. Bought this in XL


Could have possibly gotten the large but this was a great fit with room to move happily.


Petty  coat is optional. But looks best with petticoat â�¤


Had to return. Product arrived with a damaged zipper and a seam that was not fully sewn (leaving a large hole in the dress).
