This is an adorable dress!  It has a cute vintage look without making me feel like I'm wearing a costume.  I bought it to wear to an upcoming Kentucky Derby party, and it's just what I was looking for.  I'm 5' 8" and a size 14. I ordered the XL.  It fits me perfectly.  The hem falls just below my knees.  It has nice stretch and softness.  I don't have the zipper problem other reviewers have mentioned.  It's obviously not an expensive dress, but its fine for what I wanted it for.  I also bought the crinoline to go with it and it's darling.  It looks fine without it, but the crinoline adds to the vintage vibe.  Very cute dress!


Nice fabric. Seams are ok. Fits in a strange place for my waist. Expected it to be higher and not hit the middle of my body. Knew it wouldn't be lower cut just from the style. Slightly smaller overall (sz 10)  and just fits my 36 DD (maybe even a little snug)


I love the pattern, the style, I just love everything about this dress. It looks great with a petti coat as well. I order two of these dress at the same time, different patterns and I love both of them.  I recommend going up 1 size depending on your body. It does have stretch to it.


Beautiful fitting dress.  I usually wear a 6, and the small fit fantastic!  The material is nice and thick, so you can't see through the dress.  I want to get other colors in this dress too, it's amazing!


I *love* this dress - the style, the fact that its cotton and plain without being frumpy. Its lovely. I was in a hurry and got the X-large. I read a lot of the reviews, I love that there are so many people that love this dress but every body is different so it was hard to know if it will fit ME too.


I am 5`9" and 185 pounds - kind of bottom heavy, so the bust was a bit roomier than I would like. I probably could've gotten away with a smaller size if I'd had more time to send back and get the smaller one. The a-line was perfect cut for me below the waist. I love this dress and this price. You can't beat it. :)


Love this dress. I would definitely buy it in more colors! Iâ€™m 5â€™7 and the length was perfect- below the knee. I bought a size medium which is a size larger than I would usually buy in a dress but it fit well. Great buy!


I was looking for a white, conservative dress for function for my daughter and this fit the bill. The measurements on the size chart were a little odd and my daughter did not appear to fit into any size listed so I was a bit worried. But I ordered the size she normally wears in dresses and a size up just in case. The dress fit her perfectly in the size she normally wears. More importantly, my daughter was happy with how the dress fit and looked on her which is all I wanted since I was shopping for a teen. Just keep in mind if you are ordering it in white you will have to wear nude or white undergarments; any other color will show through the material.


I ordered this dress for my daughter's high school graduation in white. She is 5' 1", and a 40DD. After posting a question about what size to order, I went with the XXL, and it was perfect. Like another review I read, the zipper is a little flimsy, and it took both my husband and I to zip it. The zipper kept wanting to get stuck on the zipper lining. I will need to purchase a slip of some sort because it is a bit see through. You would definitely be able to see darker underwear through it. Overall it's a decent dress for $23.99, and will work perfectly for graduation since it will be under her grad gown anyway.


It came fast and looks nice and got a well but did not have the pink sash on the dress and that was the reason I purchased it in the first place I will keep it but can  only give 3 stars because now I have hot pink shoes to match the belt and there was no belt on or with th e dress and I needed those colors for an occasion that's color coded and now I have to find a belt....ğŸ˜¢â˜¹


I am 5'2" amd 145lbs and ordered a Large. Overall, it fit very well, was snug without cutting off circulation, form fitting with just the right flare in the skirt, beginning at the hips. As I'm on the short side, the dress was just a tad too long but, with a bit of tailoring, I'm sure it would've been fine. Unfortunately, I did have to return it because the fabric was not what I was expecting; fabric was scratchy and reminded me of a shower curtain. It did not have the correct look for a formal party--which is what I was searching for.


Would be great for a costume party, though!
