Cute dress perfect for date nights


I liked it. It arrived with stains on it though.


Wish there was more wiggle room in the zipper area. I'm a small and ripped it a little putting it on. Was able to get it fixed tho. Loved the way it fit. Just not crazy about how you get it on.


This dress fits as if it was made for me! It is perfect. I will be wearing it next month for a special occasion. I have no problem with it . I am 5-5‚Äù and 146 pounds. I ordered a medium size. It is beautiful!


I loved the material.  Colour is just as pictured. Fitted perfectly.


Fits as expected the materials where great can't wait to buy another one in a different color.


I absolutely love this dress. The material is great, it's soft but yet it's heavy enough that the dress falls nicely and has a great shape.


The size is true to fit and the color is fantastic.


The dress came very fast and the price can not be beat. Thank you!


Great fit for the $$! If you have a need for a new dress, you can't go wrong with this purchase. I don't recommend this dress to someone who isn't 5'6" or taller or you will need to do alterations. It's simple yet a perfect fit for most women and the colors are bold and really very pretty.


I love this dress!


I am petite so I will have it taken in.  Very cute dress nonetheless and great price.  Hem falls below the knees.
