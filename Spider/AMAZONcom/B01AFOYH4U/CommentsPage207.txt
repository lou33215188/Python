Wore it for an Alice in Wonderland costume, and it was perfect! I used the black bow doubled up for a hair bow.


this dress arrived with the zipper halfway down and split, so stuck I couldn't even try to fix it. further, the armpits had white deodorant stains. so gross and disappointing.


I was nervous about purchasing a dress online. After reading several reviews I decided to chance it and to my surprise this dress is beautiful and fit perfectly. Beautiful dress and a fantastic price!


This dress is amazing. Fits as it should have. Great quality.


Longer than I thought, goes well past my knees. Very thin material. Will have to make some alterations.


Loved it!


A very nice dress but runs a size small (large is more like a medium), had to order another one.


I love this dress so much, and it looks just as I assumed it would! Excellent dress I would most definitely recommend it.


Fits great, looks great!  You'll love it!


Neckline is a little strange but otherwise love it.
