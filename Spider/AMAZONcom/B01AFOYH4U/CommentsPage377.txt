The dress was as expected just slightly smaller that required.


The fit is great!


very cute but too small


Butiful


It's a perfect fit I love it and will definitely order another one


Love it.


Great dress.


Love it, I was so cute for my Birthday dinner.


Nice quality looked great


It fit nicely but is very cheaply made. I ripped at the seam the very first time I wore it.
