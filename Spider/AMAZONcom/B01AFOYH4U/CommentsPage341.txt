Thought it would be thicker but it's not thin by any means.


Dress is beautiful but 0 quality to zipper it ripped just when I tried it.


Fits ok but not true to size at all I am an XL and I wish I would have gotten a 2X


The dress is beautiful.  Nice and light for a summer wedding.


Me like it a lotğŸ˜€


Very comfortable and fits well. Great price, well made. I recommend this dress as you will feel like a movie star!


Loved it.  Fit a little to snug in the bust area.  Want to keep as I have been dropping weight and it should be perfect in a couple of weeks!


Lovely


Love the dress, it didn't have care instructions through.
