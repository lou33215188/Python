Picked this up for a friend of mine during prime day. She loves it!


Also got one in black.


Our daughter was very pleased with the dress. It fitted perfectly oand loooked smashing.


We really love this dress, it was just a little big on my daughter but not a problem. It is very well made and the material is very vibrant and free of flaws. She looks very modest and lovely in it. It does have a nice flare and very vintage looking style. I couldn't be happier with this. She can't wait to wear it to school. I received this at a discount price for my honest review. We give it 2 thumbs up!!
