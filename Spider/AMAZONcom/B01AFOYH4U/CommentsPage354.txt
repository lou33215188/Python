I brought a 2X but it's runs too small it felt like a 1X


Was very disappointed with dress. Wasn't as advertised, the dress was a table cloth material. Will NEVER BUY AGAINğŸ˜ 


True to color and fit nice.


Beautiful dress however fabric is very see through and wrinkles don't come all out with ironing/steam.


Absolutely loved it! its a beautiful dress!! â�¤


A good quality classic design.


Nice dress, but the white arrived as an ivory.


Really disappointed that the dress was wayyy longer than expected but other than that pretty dress.


Looks and fits beautifully. I'll be buying more


The fit and flare style is fabulous but I find the material very heavy and hard to keep from getting wrinkled.
