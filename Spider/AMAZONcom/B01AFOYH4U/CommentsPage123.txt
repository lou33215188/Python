I bought a 2X and it fit but was a bit tight. Great dress though, thick material, perfect length, just needs pockets! :-p My mom took the zipper out and gave me a couple more inches with some fabric for a costume, which I needed with my big bust. Will probably buy another dress in another color for such a great price!


Just beautiful! Especially with a petticoat underneath to flare out the skirt. This fit my daughter beautifully. She normally wears a size 4 to 6, and the medium was perfect.


This dress was very comfortable and flattering. I just wish the fabric was a little softer.


Lovely dress, runs a bit smaller than I expected as I have purchased this brand before and a XL worked fine.  I wear a 14/16 normally.  I will not be wearing it with the ribbon belt.


Awesome dress. Many compliments.


great


Great dress for the price.  Very cute! Received many compliments when I wore for my daughters shower.  The quality is better than I expected. Its easy to wear and not too thin and not too heavy.  Good for a summer day.


Wow! For the price I received this dress in a custom resealable bag. The material is stretch and the fit matched perfectly with my dimensions to their chart. I am petite so this is longer than my knee cap, but will continue to wear it for speaking engagements!


Great for the price


I am 5'3" and weight 108lb the small dress fit very nicely on me.
