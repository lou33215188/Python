Nice fit. Good material and fast shipping. Looks like expensive party ware


Material was VERY rough (mostly cotton with poly blend I think). I ordered a 2XL bc I have a large chest and my midsection is catching up. It was actually a bit tight at the midsection and then was too large from the neck to top of chest.


However, I will definitely order from them again. They made my return simple and lets face it.... they have cute stuff!


Fits as expected....very cute


I ordered a size bigger than my regular size and it fits perfect!  Very cute dress.  I always receive compliments when wearing it.  Zipper sticks sometimes which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.


Cute dress.  I ordered a size larger after reading the other reviews, I'm glad I did.  It fit great.  I wanted this dress to help create a waste line for myself, I am plus size and carry most of my weight in my abdomen.  It did need to be ironed.


Were a 7-9, 36DD with a 27-29 inch waist order a lager it fit perfectly


it runs small


I love this figure flattering dress. Change the sash out for an entire new look!!! Very well made.


The pattern is too busy for my tastes and the size is too small. It goes back.


Beautiful dress. Well made and good quality material. Looked great and daughter felt beautiful. Original, she was the only girl at the dance with this dress.
