I really like the dress and think it feels high quality, but the bodice is too short, and makes me look really awkward.


I absolutely love this dress and it fits fantastic!!


Please add me to the stress review that is absolutely great it fits me perfect I love the zipper down the back I love the color I have a hat to match I just love this dress I will be ordering more soon thank you so much


The material is nice; however, the length is much longer than I had anticipated. Not happy about having to spend extra money to get to  it hemmed. The top portion is a little extra boxy isn't as flattering as the picture.  Looks more like bridesmaid dress when worn . If you like the conservative look this dresses for you. Material is gorgeous, it "fits" color is beautiful, but, the dress is not quite what I expected. looks better in the picture


Dress arrived with the RED sash laying on it, which caused a light red stain on the front. Since I was short on time and itâ€™s hard to find white in December I decided to wash the dress and add a little bleach to it and the stain came out. Please DO NOT place a Red Sash on a white dress again, it should go in a separate package.


See through material & not well put together. Looks nothing like the picture


Super cute on. Wish the fabric was a bit softer but good value for the price.


I followed the size chart and this fit true to size. It looks cute with a petticoat if you are hoping for the flared look. The skirt is super full, more than a full circle :)


Gorgeous Dress!!! Love the flow it has...its a bit big in the mid section, but nothing I can't adjust with a quick run on my sewing machine. Certainly turned my husband's head when he saw it on me!!!


I love this dress! True to size! I wear an XL(16) normally and loved how the dress fit! I paired it with a crop top and got so many compliments!
