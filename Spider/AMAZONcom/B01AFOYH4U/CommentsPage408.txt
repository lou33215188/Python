Somewhat larger than what I was expecting, but some quick alterations are all that's necessary. Irons nicely!


Like the dress, but not lined and has no washing instructions. I washed in cold, delicate cycle. Then I dried on delicate cycle. Dress came out fine.


zipper broke while trying to put this on. Very dissapointed


Dress was about 5 sizes too big and I measured myself and ordered based on the size chart.


I do not recommend as this item was very disappointing.


Was not what I expected at all. I thought it was 100% Cotton but it isn't which would have been fine but it also has no give in the material. I ordered a size 3X which may as well been a M. I definitely cannot fit close to a 3X but figured it would be if alterations were needed. It really is a cute dress but it has to go back :(


The worst dress I bought tried to return it after the post office lost it and now it's too late scratchy cheap material


Beautiful dress fits great just like it says.


I know after a bit of ironing and addition of jewelry I will look bomb in this dress, very elegant, fitted perfectly.The length was alright although a bit longer than I am accustomed too. I don't know why but I thought fabric would be stretchy-like. Thankfully it was not.


The photo of the dress pictured here online is not what was shipped to me; instead, I received a cream colored dress. Also, the dress does is fairly sheer underneath, requiring some sort of undergarment to conceal all underwear. Unfortunately I will be returning this item within the next few days due to the color.
