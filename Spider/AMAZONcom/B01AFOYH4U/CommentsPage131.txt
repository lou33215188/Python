Love the dress just not my granddaughters style.


LOVE THIS DRESS! It's such a great dress, and at such an amazing price, I had to buy it in another color. The white fabric is not sheer at all and hides bra and underwear great. It would be even better if it had pockets, but for this price, I can't complain!


If you noticed, this is a little long. You definitely need the tutu skirt underneath.


The sizing is perfect but the neckline is too high for me. The dress is great quality and nice fabric.


so much cuter than I expected!!! loved it!


I would give this lovely dress a 10 if I could. The fit was perfect!  When you wear this dress you'll feel so pretty! I have ordered 2 more and can't wait to get them I've received so many compliments. The material is just fabulous. Rest assure the picture is true to the real thing. Since my last post, I've ordered 3 more!!!


Daughter pick this out for herself. Itâ€™s cute.


They run a size small. But that is a really cute dress, nice cut, good material.


I like the dress. It seemed well made over all. Nice fabric. However, I didn't care for the pattern on me. Will probably order a plain one and try that.


5'8 and 190lbs and the XL fit perfect and hit at my knees! Cute and classy
