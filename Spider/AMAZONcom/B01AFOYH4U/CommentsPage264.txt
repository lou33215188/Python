True to size. Well made. Longer than I expected but that is the style. Love it!


Very pretty.


This was the perfect dress for my engagement photos, I loved the classy style it has, it was a little thinner that I thought It would be but I wore a slip underneath so it wasn't a problem!


I liked the style. But didn't like the fact that this company seems to cut the sizes to tight


it was too small at the boobs. the material is not stretchy at all.


I received so many compliments on this dress. It was simple yet classy with the added petticoat.


Great quality


Great dress, ran a little large for me


I purchased this dress for  40th reunion. It was a little tight in the top region, that's why it didn't get 5 stars. I wished there was some material so I could have let it out.  But the overall quality of the dress was great


Perfect dress for my body type. I'm 5'7 and 160 pounds. just had a baby so I needed something to hide my belly. I got the medium and it fits perfectly! The color is cute. I will be ordering more!
