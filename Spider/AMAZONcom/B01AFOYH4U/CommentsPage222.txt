The 1st size xxl was too big. My true size xl fits perfect . 40DD


im 5'3 and about 110 lbs and i got a medium and it fit a tad bit loose but it was not a big deal. its strechy it looks nice with a petticoat but its not a big deal if you wear it without one. i took off a star because it shrunkin the wash and i didnt even dry it i just washed it


Great, vivid blue color. Fit well, although the waist was a couple of inches above my waist, but I'm told that that's the style.


I love the dress, fabric is of good qualityl. It runs a bit big for me, although I followed the size chart. I will however still purchase another, now that I know how it fits.


I love this dress!  Wish it had lining - but fabric is nice so probably not needed.  Fits perfectly and the ribbon gives it a nice look.


The dress fit perfectly and is lovely. It can be dressed up or worn casually, so it is very versatile.


The quality of the dress was very nice. However I had to return it because it was too small across the chest and too large around the waist.


Beautiful dress. It fits well everywhere except the bust


Beautiful dress. Fit just as stated.


It was perfect fit, very thin so i wasnt sweating in it. Lol
