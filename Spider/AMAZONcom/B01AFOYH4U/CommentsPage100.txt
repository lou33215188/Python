I love this dress!! You can dress it up or dress it down. It fits any occasion! Fits great. I had a little issue with the zipper but other than that I love it!!!


Great quality and coloring and the design is beautiful.  The dress is all around flattering to any size women.


Absolutely love this dress.  I am short, so it comes down to mid to lower calf. I think it needs to be paired with a bright colored belt to break up the white.  Good quality and fits perfectly. The only down side is that it needs to be hand washed and line dried. It looks cute paired with a string of pearls. I am wearing this for my engagement photo session and for our rehearsal dinner.  So is absolutely prefect


The dress itself is great ( I ordered two in different sizes just in case), but it is waaaaay long. I could say by midcalf. I usually wear US size 6, Large size in this dress was a little big, but comfortable. Again, no complaints to the dress,style and material --- only the length.


it wrinkled easily, , color fade after 2 wash. I decide never buy this kind of dress in Amazon.


Even though the dress is slightly small, it is beautiful and well made.  Far exceeded my expectations!


Beautiful Dress. You do need to order a size down, though. It arrived on time, unwrinkled, and lovely.


Fit as expected, but seemed cheaply made. I wouldn't buy again. I had actually intended to return this, but my baby spit up on it as I was trying it on. Oh well


Love it! Very beautiful.  I usually wear a medium but followed the size chart and got a large. Perfect fit. Be sure to follow the size chart.


wore it the other night . very pretty
