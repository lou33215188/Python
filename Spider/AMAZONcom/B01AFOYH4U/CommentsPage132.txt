I like this dress. It's a little prone to wrinkling, but with the dark color it wasn't super noticeable. I'm happy with my purchase, especially for the price.


I got the white one with butterflies, size small. I'm 5'6" and a 34A. It is a little roomy in the bust for me, but otherwise fits surprisingly well! It goes past the knee slightly, and has a nice swing. It looks okay without a petticoat but it's so adorable with one.


The fit of this dress was kind of awkward. The waist is way too low and the chest area baggy and loose. The material is soft but wrinkles very easily and stayed wrinkled until I ironed it. This dress was soft and a pretty color but I'll probably never wear it for all of it's faults.


Love it!


This dress is super cute and well made. I would order a large if I ordered again. Iâ€™m 5 ft 6 in, 143 lbs.


Beautiful dress. Seller was great and it arrived timely. Only con is it wrinkles so you may need to steam or iron it.


These dresses are great, I bought 2 and will likely purchase more from them. The top is slightly snug on me but the next size up was too loose in the waist and didn't look right. But I'm a 34e...my avg dress size is 6-8, 5'6" 155lbs


I have not worn it yet but I tried it on and it fits as expected (my size) and looks beautiful. I really hope it does not shrink after the first wash. After the first use, I will write a whole review.


I love this dress. Took a chance and ordered it for a wedding I am attending in a few days and so glad I did. I am a 14, smaller above the waist but curvy on the bottom. The large fit perfect. If you are busty, would do XL. Great fabric.


This dress is awesome! I was so worried when I bought it because usually when you order a dress online, it comes in looking like a plastic bag, but this dress is super high quality and fit me perfectly! Highly recommend!
