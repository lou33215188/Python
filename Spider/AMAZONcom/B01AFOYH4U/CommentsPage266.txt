Fit like I expected.


Love this dress! Came in nice packaging and fits me like a glove.


The zipper broke on the first use and the fabric was very thin


I'm 5'7 and thin, I bought the medium. Fits amazing! Perfect vintage style dress for my job.


Very nice!  I haven't washed it yet, but hopefully will still be as nice. It fit great and was comfortable.


Love the dress.  Nice quality and shape.  Not as flared  as the photo but  that's to be expected


Im a 36DD, and was a little worried this dress would be tight in the chest, and loose in the hip, but i was very happy to find out that it fits perfectly! I ordered an XL for a wedding and it is a perfect formal dress. I am very happy with this item.


Cute but definitely go a size up


Gorgeous dress! Very pleased with my purchase. Love  the red sash and can't wait to wear it next month! Yes


Love this dress. It fits true to my regular dress size and the waist is just perfect. It is really cute and fun.
