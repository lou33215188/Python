Terrible dress! VERY cheap material! Do not buy!


I like the dress


I loved it


Great dress.


Perfect black dress


great dress!


It was a little tight in the arms.


The dress was too small and made of cheap material which looked faded. Honestly, I didn't expect much because it was so cheap. The old adage "you get what you pay for" is true in this case. The great news is how quickly Amazon refunded my money. Totally amazing turnaround!


The color is fabulous !


I  agree! nice fit and fun to wear
