I ordered these dresses for my bridesmaids. And they are gorgeous. I've had some reviews that said I should buy a petticoat for it. But I don't think it really needs it unless you want to little bit more volume. But my steamer will be to the rescue. Came in very wrinkled. But that's a quick fix!  PS I had very large chest area bridesmaids. These dresses were very accommodating


The dress we received was not like the picture at all. It was very tight on bottom and loose on the top. We figured it was a packaging error, so we returned and re-ordered. Second dress arrived today and it was correct. Thanks


The dress looks great in a photo, but was very cheaply made. The material is thin and stiff while the zipper keeps getting snagged. There were several loose threads right out of the box. I will likely return the dress.


Many compliments on this dress..I also purchased the tulle to go underneath to give some added flare. I purchased 2 dresses like this and plan to order more


Super cute dress. The waist seem is lower than I expected.

Love this dress. It arrived as expected and was packaged very well. My outfit to a wedding last night and got quite a few complements. Paired with pearls true vintage look. Material is of great quality and definitely a great staple for anyone's closet.
