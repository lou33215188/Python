love this


My wife picked out the dress, I just ordered it for her. She seemed upset that it was a little snug in the chest part.


This style of dress of extremely complimentary for those of us with small waists and ample curves.


I love it good material beautiful


The quality is superb! Perfect fit, beautiful shade of blue and speedy delivery. Thanks a bunch.


Fit as expected


Fits perfectly..love it


Nice. Need to order bigger size than you think.


Dress fit great, loved how pretty it was but zipper broke 1st time tried to wear it.  Now I have to get it fixed so I can actually wear the dress.


I love it. I thought they run small but they dont. I ordered a large and it wmded up being a little big. I am normally a size medium.
