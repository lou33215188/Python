Wonderfully soft material.  Fits pretty good.  Just wish the neck line was not so high.


Great dress! Very good quality ! Wore it on my graduation. It looks expensive and very elegant . Highly recommend !


Very happy with this dress.


Gorgeous and comfortable! I'm 5'7 and 185 lbs and the XL fit perfectly. Like it was tailored for me! I will definitely be investing in another one.


I had to purchase a somewhat large size but was very pretty, a bit longer than the blue version of this same dress


Very thick material, I love that about it. Fit wonderfully as for shape wise. It was loose fitting, could have bought a smaller size.


did't like look or feel of material.


Love it! Nice heavier material, feels very comfortable


Fits and flatters. The length is great.... not too short so bend over without worry! The fabric is slightly stretchy, so allows movement, but still very nice. I actually kept several in different colors! Just an FYI... the high neck ones are VERY high, I couldn't keep it because it was cutting into the base of my neck. Seems not to bother some people though... so give it a try! :)


I order the medium and it would have fitted it it had more stretch in the material.  The large as to big.  I loved the dress but I am in between sizes on this dress.  If it fitted, I would have bought another color.
