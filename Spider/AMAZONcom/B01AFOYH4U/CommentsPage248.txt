I love this dress!  Got so many compliments!  It was a little snug up top, but it worked fine.


The quality of the dress is great but very, very small.  I will be returning it and trying a larger size.  Definitely order at least one size larger than you  normally wear.


smaller than the size guide indicated.


Although the dress is gorgeous, it ran way to small in the top.  I will give it to someone else to try.  cannot have a chest in this dress.


Material is stuff an it was not the right size even by going from their size chart. Should have gotten a larger one.


I love the dress!
