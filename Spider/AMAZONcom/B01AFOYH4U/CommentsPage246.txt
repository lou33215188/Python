Love it! Saving it for Mothers Day! Fit and length are perfect!


I love the fabric is really confortable


Great quality dress, received in beautiful packaging, love the red sash!


Dress was same color. Top have was like the picture. Bottom half didn't flare out as pictured and didn't have the creases as shown. But it still suit the purpose.


Dress fits perfectly but it isn't as white as I had hoped.


I only give this product a 3 because about 2 hours into wearing it, the zipper broke and haven't been able to fix it since. Other than that it would have been perfect


I'm 5'6" 135lbs. The small fit perfectly.  Got tons of compliments!


beautiful dress! thanks so much and I will be definatley ordering another one soon!


The medium was a little big so I returned it for a small. Fit perfect and was a classy choice for my son's graduation! I love this dress and will get a lot of use out of it!! Made well!! Don't hesitate to buy!


Fits great! Love the material. I did size up simply because my measurements were in between two sizes. Glad I did
