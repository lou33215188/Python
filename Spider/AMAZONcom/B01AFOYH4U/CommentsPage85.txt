I will need to get it taken in a bit but it is a very flattering dress. I recommend a petticoat underneath.


Dress is comfortable, well fitting, and stretchy. I've gotten lots of compliments on it.


Major compliments.  I bought for my daughter.  Very elegant.  Invest in the crinoline to poof it out


Perfect fit - looks amazing!


Itâ€™s a valentines dance dress for my daughter!


Fits her great! Good material. She loves it!


Bought XL, I normally wear size 14-16 bra 38DD, this fit perfectly.


Beautiful and flattering.  I would order 1 size up like I done.  It fit perfectly!


I was a bit nervous as sometimes i order XXL due to my wide hips. But i guess due to type of dress the XL was just right. Perfect fit. i am 199lbs 5ft 1" and dress fit perfectly.


Poorly made ,too small in the bust ,seams didn't line up


I loved this dress! It's so pretty and fit well. I just took my measurements and ordered exactly the size that corresponded with my measurements, don't be alarmed if the allotted size is 2 sizes bigger. If you don't consult the size chart, you'll probably be upset bc it won't fit. The skirt was also full enough without any kind of petticoat (I think that's what it's called) or anything under it.
