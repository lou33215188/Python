Very nice dress! I usually wear a size 6 and the medium is just a little big but very comfortable. The material seems to be very good quality. I have no complaints. Very happy with the dress!


Loved the dress!  I'm 5'11 & 163 lbs.  I bought a medium and it fit like a glove!


I love the dress, it fits as expected and the dewing is nice.~


Great dress, I ordered the XL size based on reviews and suggestion to follow the size chart exact.  Dress fit bigger than expected Large would have been plenty big for 160lb frame


I was sent a triple x instead of xl. I was not aware the dress even came that large. Even though I wore it to the planned event, it will need taken in for the next time for a better fit.


I've worn this once and received multiple compliments.  Strangers on the street told me they liked it, and even my 8 year old said, "it's very eye catching!" Super flattering and looks good without the belt too.


I absolutely LOVE this dress!


a little high waisted, but with a wide belt it worked great.  Got lots of compliments when i wore it to work.  I loved the flair and the airy look of the dress.  It would be great for church, work, or a night out.  Great dress for the money.


This dress is made from a nice substantial fabric and has a cute vintage look. It fits as expected, not too big or small. It is fitted. Overall a great dress, especially for the price.


I love this dress. I bought it to wear for my engagement photos, and it fits and looks exactly how I thought it would! Arrived very wrinkled, but I wouldn't expect much less than that. And the box it was shipped in was too big for what it was. However, I am extremely pleased with this dress!
