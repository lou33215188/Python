Great dress . Thanks .


It is made to fit flat chested women...Other then that it was really cute and well made..


It's not thin, so that's a plus. It is comfortable. I do NOT like how difficult it is to keep wrinkles away.


I love this dress! It fits as expected and is very comfortable. The swing skirt is flirty and fun to wear. This dress is well made and will work for the daytime or night. The dress is great and the price is unbeatable


I wore this dress to my cousin' wedding and got so many compliments on it.  I ordered the tulle underskirt separately, and it looks great (although dress is also cute with out it).  The material is rather thin and feels a little cheap to me, but it looks great on!


This dress is well made, fabric is nice and thick very easy to iron.


Loved the dress, but it was not anywhere near the size I ordered and I did use the size chart.


This is a good dress. I am hosting a garden tea party soon and wanted a unique dress. It was packaged well and fits beautifully and the fabric is good.


Gorgeous!!


I weigh 250lbs and my breasts are a 40H. I ordered a 2X in this dress and it fit perfect!!! My first time ordering any type of clothes on Amazon so I was skeptical but pressed for time and could not find anything my size in the stores. Im glad I made this purchase! I will be making more of them.
