I followed the measurement guide in the photos and the dress fits as expected. Great style, great fit great value. It really is a full skirt and is just like the pictures. I think I need more in different colors!


I absolutely love this dress. I wasn't sure it would fit alright but it was a perfect fit. Ordered it in black and am now thinking of getting another color. The only complaint is have is that the zipper gets a little stuck half way.


Very very blue


Love this dress!  Great fit and flare with beautiful colors.  Fits true to size.  Compliments each time I've worn it.


The dress is very nice, runs a little bigger than the size chart read, but overall a great dress for the price.  I would go one size smaller than you think for a nice fit, but if you like your clothing on the loose side, go with the size chart.


I'm very pleased with this dress.


This dress is for my daughter for my wedding and it fits perfect and looks great on her.


Hem line is several inches different on left side front and right side back.


The zipper split down the back my first time wearing it. At work. The size was fine, the zipper was sown incorrectly. I am so sad, I loved the dress for the 3 hours I had it! Sad to see it go back.


When the dress arrived, it had a huge rip in the back next to the zipper.


Great dress. I used it for a Halloween costume. Fit nicely, I am 5'10 and the skirt came to my knees. Size chart is true to the product. The zipper would stick at times and the armpits were cut a but tight and rubbed after a while. Overall though I was very pleased.
