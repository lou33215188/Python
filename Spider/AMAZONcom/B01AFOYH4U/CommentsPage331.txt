I was very pleased with my dress,


I got a lot complements on dress.


Perfect fit. My daughter loves it


Love the way the dress fit my body. It is a nice flowy dress.


Gift for my mother; she loved the fit and flare of the dress.


Dress is very cute and fits very well. Pretty long, went past my knees.


If I could give this no stars I would.  This dress is so cheaply made that I didn't even bother to try it on.  Will be returning to Amazon as soon as I can get some packing tape.  Don't waste your money on these dressels.  They are cheap and look nothing like the pictures of the products.


Absolutely loved it looked amazing but was alittle snug. Wish it would have been just alittle bit luser.


Pretty red dress.my wife loves it.gave it to her for valentines.lots of compliments


Normally don't order clothes online as I need to try everything that I buy. This dress was awesom and it fits just right.
