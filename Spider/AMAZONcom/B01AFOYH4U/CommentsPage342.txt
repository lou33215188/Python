ordered white, and of-white(pearl) came instead so didnt like that.. very very see thru wouldn't order white again.


Perfect. $20 super value.


Dress looks cute just as expected


Fit and looks great


Very nice and feminine. I love it


I have a small waist so, so had to take in .


Love my dress so glad it fits and was very affordable.


Beautiful dress


I guess it won't be my favorite dress. Made me look bigger than I am.


Liked the dress but it was cut eay too small under the armpits


It fit perfectly and overall looked great on me.
