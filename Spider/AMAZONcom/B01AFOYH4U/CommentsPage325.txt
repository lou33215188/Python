Came with a black belt instead of red ☹️


Love..love this dress. Fit as expected.


Super cute dress...a little see through though.  You're going to have to make wise under garment selections.


It says spandex there is no stretch give or pull. Measurements are wrong I ordered one size up and it was still too small. I am not pleased.


The package Came early and I love the dress


Excellent dress perfect fit


Dress fits good. Did have it altered in the length. I'm 5'1 so it was longer than I wanted. But overall a very pretty, flattering dress.


Beautiful.  Breathable fabric. Nice flare with and without petticoat. Will make more purchases from this company


Love this dress so much I bought a black and red one. Great quality, excellent price.


It came really wrinkled, but other than that it was fine!
