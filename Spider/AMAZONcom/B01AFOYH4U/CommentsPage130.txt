Great looking dress for the price.  It will look nice on formal night.


I bought this dress for myself and my sister took it from me and wore it to the party. Very nice quality. I loved the material and the flow of the session on her. I will but myself another.


Very fitted in the bodice


According to the size chart, I ordered a large.  Got in the dress and couldn't even get it zipped.  When I looked at the tag, it was a EU L and a US M.  Not sure why the mixup.  Not worth the hassle of sending it back so I'll just give it away to someone and be out the $$.  Wish the sizing would have been clarified up front.


The dress is beautifully made but I am 38DD and it is a bit snug on the top. With a good bra it fit pretry good. It does have a little stretch. I didn't have a problem with zipper because I could pull it on over my head. I usually get a size 16 so I choose the XXL. I would buy another. Can't wait to wear it.


I really like it, but it was larger than I expected. My daughter is a small (according to the size chart) but she could have worn an extra small.


I love this dress and the material is nice and sturdy.


The dress looks very nice.


Used this dress as Babette's costume in our production of Beauty and the Beast. It fit perfectly, based on the size chart from the company. It also looked amazing on stage, especially with the crinoline underneath and the feathers on top!


This dress is perfect! My daughter loves it! Such a flattering fit and very classic. The size small fit her 5 foot 9 slim frame with 34 DDD bust
