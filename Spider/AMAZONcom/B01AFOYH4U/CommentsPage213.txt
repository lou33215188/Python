This is nothing like the picture. The fabric is terribly cheap and is similar to an umbrella. Also impossible to get out wrinkles, it wrinkles very easily. Returning asap


Perfect fit, gorgeous dress for a low price!


Nice full skirt that flares when you spinğŸ˜€


I loved how light this dress was and was sad that it was too big for me. I ordered a small, I'm 5'1", 125 pounds. I went to order a different size but they didn't have an extra small.


This dress fit as expected and pretty much looks like in the picture. You wouldn't really need a petticoat unless you absolutely want one to go with it.


I got this dress for a party at work and even won best dressed! It fit exactly how I expected and was stunning!


Super cute! Fits well, love the pattern!


Fit perfect,Thanks.


material and quality of dress is excellent, I order xxl not giving me the exact fit/look I wanted but I am afraid if I go smaller it will be too tight.


Pretty dress and good quality for the price. I'm excited to wear it as a guest for a wedding. I'm 5'3 - 5'4 and the dress fell right below my knees. It's a little too long so I'm hemming it 2in higher.
