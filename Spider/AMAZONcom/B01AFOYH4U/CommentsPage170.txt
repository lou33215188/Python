way too small


the material is not thick enough. the color is very pretty though.


had to return it.


Overall the dress fit fine. I am broad across the shoulders so it felt a little tight at the top for me.


Its mad very well and I love it!


This Dress is beautiful, Wear with a petticoat and it fills out nicely,  you can also wear it without a petticoat, but I like how the petticoat fills it out


Very long - I'm 5'8 and it was mid calf. pretty lose around the waist as well, ordered a medium, I'm 130 pounds.


It's just what I needed! It's a little tight and somewhat see through though, but that's okay. I'm using it for a costume so I'll be adding a bunch of stuff to it.


Love it...don't like ordering dresses from online never fits right and the shipping back is always a hassle BUT...THIS DRESS WAS PERFECT, PERFECT.


LOVE


I found that the colors differ for sizes, the black is true to size but the pink polka dot was tighter. Also, the cut on the neck was higher on the pink polka dot one but it is perfect on the black.


Was received wrinkled and I had planned to return. But something in my told me to have the dress dry cleaned. Well, needless to say, I REALLY LOVE The dress and will not return.
