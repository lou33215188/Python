Fast delivery & beautiful dress!


Was skeptical to order clothing online since my body is so awkwardly shaped but it fit perfectly! And is super cute! Will definitely be ordering more dresses from them


Very pretty dress. Fits great.  True to size.


Love this dress. Fits great. 4 stars because there are no care instructions.


This dress is gorgeous! Exactly what I was looking for! Seller was wonderful! Got my dress lickety split!


Loved it! I used it for my engagement pictures!


Looks great on young ladies and more mature woman. Wearing with a crinoline underskirt to give the skirt the full effect - very classy.


Love my dress.  I'm going to buy in more colors because the price isn't bad at all.


Perfect I would buy another one in a different color. Love the material and the feel


It's hard to find a simple dress that looks nice and is also modest and feminine. I ordered a size larger than I thought I needed and it fits perfect. It goes with heels, flats, and Sandles. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the fabric. I will buy it again
