This was really cute - it just wasn't for me.


I was so tempted by all the positive reviews for this - and it is a super-cute design and it's well-made for the price. My problem is that it's just not a good fit for a tall girl with a longish torso and a smallish bust. The waist on this is meant for a height of probably 5'6", and would work well if you wanted a slightly high waist for a taller lady. At nearly 5'10", the waist on this was about 3 inches higher than my natural waist and the skirt only just came to the top of my knees. Again, a great idea! I was just too tall for it. Also, the bust was too big for me, and I would have had to have it altered to fit. If I adored the rest of the fit, it would have been worth it. As it was, I looked like I was trying to wear a dress meant for someone much more curvy and petite. I returned it, and with Prime, the return was a snap.


Lovely style! And I applaud all the ladies who wear this well. It just isn't a style for me. My loss!


Chest is a bit large but the dress still looks amazing! Ordered a small & might have pulled off an XS since the fabric has some stretch. I'm 5'10" chest 34" waist 27". Fabric is heavy (in a good way). The black dress came with a red bow belt but since its a slippery ribbon I'll probably use a real belt. Pics with & without the petticoat recommended by Amazon


The fabric used to make this garment is worth more than the cost of the dress.  I have purchased similar dresses with a lesser quality fabric for a lot more than what I paid for this piece.  The length is perfect just below the knees. Its high waisted and fits perfectly. I plan on purchasing as many as I can before these prices go through the roof and it would be justified if they did. One thing most impressive is the heavy duty plastic zip up tote bag it comes with, perfect for travel.  Im 5'7 & 145lbs, size L is perfect.


Leading up to our wedding I ordered probably six dresses from different retailers and none fit correctly or were quite what I wanted. This dress was simple, modest, festive, but not too fancy. Just right for my outdoor wedding and reception. And at this price I didn't care that I might get grass stains if I plopped down on a picnic blanket. I expected to have to have it altered, but I liked the way it fit right out of the bag, so just had it professionally pressed and added an underskirt to make it poof.


I'm 5'1", bust size 34A, 115lbs, and this was big in the chest area (but most things are for me!). I wish there was an extra small option. The dress is so cute and I'm keeping it. I'm going to try to make some minor alterations. It's not super big--it just isn't tight around the chest. I'm also short, so this is a tad longer than I wanted, but I'll just wear it with heels.


The fabric is great with a bit of stretch and the skirt fans out beautifully. The ochre yellow is the perfect color; I was scared I might end up with a neon instead.


All in all, it is a BEAUTIFUL dress. I got lots of compliments on it. After washing and drying it a few times, the chest seemed to fit a bit better.


I love, love, love this dress! I wore it to an outdoor wedding and to church and received multiple compliments on it. It is very flattering for this large girl and it is comfy, too! I will reorder more in various colors. I am 5'4" and 210 lbs and wear a size 18 typically. The XXL fit like a glove. I also ordered a petticoat which dresses it up even more and adds a fabulous swing look. Speaking of swing, this dress brought out the little girl in me as it is a perfect "twirl" dress. It twirls all the way up to the waist in beautiful waves. It would be a great dress for dancing. I cannot say enough good things about this dress!


I'm normally between an XL/XXL and I purchased the XXL of this dress. Zipper popped and the dress broke not even two hours into my event. Buy a size up or suffer horrible humiliation! #hopedtonotbetoolargetowearthisprettydress


I love this dress. It fits absolutely perfectly, just make sure you follow the size chart. I usually fall between an 18/20 and I ordered the XXL. I have a small waist and a very large bust and this fit my hourglass shape amazingly. The arm holes are just the right size as well, normally in sleeveless tops the arm holes are far too big in the size that fits my bust, thus making my bra hang out or requiring a tank or cami underneath. This actually fits me as it should. I love the midi length too. This is my first dress in this style, and I plan on buying several more. I do recommend giving it a good iron though. Even though it arrived packaged very nicely and folded neatly within the bag, I still had to give it a wash and good iron for it to look its best. Also, there are no care instructions on this garment. I have only washed mine once, in cold on delicate, and it seems to have done just fine. Hung to dry, no dryer.  I bought some super cute high heeled black and white shoes that look like saddle shoes to go with it. You can see the seams at the waist and in the skirt, but with a good iron and the right accessories you can't even tell. I will be looking for a wide belt for the middle and a short sweater to pair with it for work. I wore it with no belt and a longer sweater to the office last week because I just couldnt wait to wear it, and coworkers were asking about it for days and complimenting it. I am SO in love and for the price, it doesn't get much better than this! I'd never bought clothes off amazon before but I see myself doing it far more often now.


I loved the dress for my graduation ceremony. I'm 5'8 and around 160 lbs and a large fit fine. I don't like my stuff too snug. I could have fit a medI'm if I wanted to, but the large had breathing room. The only problem was that some of the material looked like some fibers were coming out, but other than that, everything was fine.


I am ABSOLUTELY blown away by this dress! I purchased it this past weekend for my upcoming "Breakfast at Tiffany's" bridal shower & after looking at a lot of reviews I figured "What the hey!" I'll take my shot! And boy am I glad I did! OMG! This dress is beautiful! Now I did also purchase the petticoat to give a fuller look to the skirt because that's what I wanted but it also looks fine without it. I usually wear between a size 12-14 (sometimes have to go up a size because of my hips) so I ordered an XL and the fit is perfect! Not too big, not tight at all, but a perfect fit! I absolutely recommend this dress! I can't wait to wear it to my bridal shower paired with my satin black gloves and pearls! Also, the attached pictures are with the petticoat underneath the dress ğŸ™‚
