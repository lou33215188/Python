Material WILL NOT iron well, looks wrinkled and attaches to lint very badly. Did not fit well under the arms, too baggy


I love this dress


This dress was beautiful and well made. I wore it to a my company Christmas party and got compliments all night.  I feel confident buying dresses online now after this purchase. I loved it.


The color does not match the color in the picture.  Neckline too is not flattering.  Returning it for a different style


I wear an XL in all dresses. This suffocated my chest. It was also very rough fabric and felt pretty cheap. Returned


Well made and a great price.


Looked beautiful


I am actually so in LOVE with this dress! Very flattering and super comfortable. I am definitely going to order again from this company.
