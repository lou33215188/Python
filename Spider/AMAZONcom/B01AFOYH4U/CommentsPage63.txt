This dress is super cute and it fits true to size. I wore to a cocktail event and received lots of compliments! The only thing is when I took it off, the zipper broke...


I bought this dress to change into at my reception so I could dance all night long.


Very happy with quality and fit.  Dress is put together nicely.  Used it for a 50's theme party and will be able to wear it again as it is somewhat timeless.  Needed a bit of ironing though!


I do love this dress but expect to iron after every wash. Also, the material attracts hair and lint easily, lint roll frequently.


Somewhat small but also still fit it has enough stretch. I wish the zipper was better but for the cost I'm happy


A perfect dress for what I needed. Used it as a canvas for an art piece. I am a 10 and it fit perfect in the breast... a tiny big for my waist but the fabric was lovely. Not too light not too heavy. Very comfortable and a big hit at the party.


Thank you.


The seams on the front of the dress are uneven and totally obvious.  Love the fabric,  but total disappointment.  Need to figure out how to return it..


Update: i was going to return it, but dont have a printer for the return lable.


Fit perfect and washed well. I gave it a 4/5 only because the zipper was sticky even without it on. I couldn't zip it myself because the zipper was that tough.


Beautiful and sexy. The dress feels good! I'm 5'2. It fits well. I thought it was going to be too long but it wasn't. This company has nice quality for reasonable prices. My order came within days.


The waist is the right size, the skirt a great length (hits about 4 inches below the knee-- I'm 5'4"), but the bodice/bust area is too big, so it doesn't lay right.  Dress looks fine with a cardigan/jacket, but I don't think I'd be comfortable wearing it without.
