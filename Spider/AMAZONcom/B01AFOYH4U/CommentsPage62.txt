I love this dress!! I got so many compliments. I ordered an XL and it fits a little snug that the waist doesn't stay flat, so I wear a light sweater tied at the waist to hide that. I've worn it with and without a petty coat and it looks great either way. Will definitely buy more from this designer.


I mean it's cute .. but not as I expected the material is more like linen. And unfortunately, it was a bit too large on the waist and chest. I returned it without a problem.


Love this dress! Be sure to take your measurements and you shouldn't have an issue with fit (I normally wear a L but based on measurements ordered XL and it's a perfect fit)


Can't wait to wear this dress!


I am 155 lbs and 5'2" - usually wear med. to large size in Women's dresses, and ordered XL.  This is the CUTEST most adorable dress that fits my ample bosom and big hips perfectly! !  I am flabbergasted ğŸ˜‚âœŒ.  The material is LOVELY-  I am now a big big fan of this Designer, will post photo soon!


I ordered a size larger due to the reviews and it was perfect. I am 5'6" and 160 lbs. I am thrilled with the weight of the fabric, which is thick so it hangs very well. The waist is a bit high, which I think is great because my small pooch is completely camouflaged.  My bra does not show under the arms and the zipper is very smooth. I would order this in every color of the rainbow and polka dotted too. This dress ends at my knees which is perfect for work. With heels and fancy jewelry I can wear it to a fancy dinner.  It does pick up fuzz, but who cares.


Orded a large because review mentioned they ran small. Although it fits slightly larger than expected, I prefer it better than fitting too small.


Purchased for a "Breakfast at Tiffany's" theme Bridal Shower along with the tutu slip. Excited to wear them when the time comes.


I purchased this dress in a Large, I am 5'11'' and 185lbs.  It fit me perfectly without being uncomfortable.  I received it on the expected delivery date.  I have purchased this dress in both White and Royal Blue.


I absolutely LOVE this dress, it fits as expected.  I am 5'9" a 10/12  ordered the XL after much deliberation, but glad I did, the waist is a little bit high, but I expect that, everything is.  A wide belt covers that, and it would look okay without a belt too.  The length is perfect, just at the bottom middle of my knee,  might order a petticoat, but I am definitely ordering more dresses in other colors, this will be my "go to" for the summer.  Quality seems good, haven't washed it yet but all seams are nicely finished.


I brought this dress for my daughter for Easter, it was a wonderful fit. If you considering this dress buy it!


This is a very cute 50ish looking dress. I wore it Valentine day when we were on a cruise and got lots of compliments.  I did wear it with a puffy petticoat but it can easily be worn without.  Nice stretch material so the dress is very comfortable to wear.  I am 5' 8" and 135 lbs so  a large was perfect.
