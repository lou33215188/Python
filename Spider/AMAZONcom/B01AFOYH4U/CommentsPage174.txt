The top fits but I had a hard time zipping it right where the seam is at the waist i should have gotten an XL but it might be too big on the top.  I am 4'11 145 pounds.  Overall it is a beautiful dress.


Material is super wrinkly, and not the best quality after its first washed but it was a very nice comfy dress


Absolutely in love! I’m 5’5” and 240 pounds and the 2X fit me perfectly, hugging all the right places while remaining long enough to wiggle around and not be immodest. I’m ordered more ASAP!


Love, love, love this dress!!! So much prettier in person that the photo! Great quality and just so classy!


Wish it came with washing instructions but it did fine in the washer and dryer. Had to iron a bit but so worth it!!!


The dress was perfect for my college graduation commencement! I looked amazing in this 1950's style dress. I only give it four stars because I spent over an hour steaming it, just to get in my truck and look down to see a whole bunch of wrinkles. Other than the wrinkles, I love the dress!


Wow!!! I was very surprised, the item was more than expected. Very elegant, shipped and delivered more than fast!


Very cute dress and great color. However, it was a little longer than I expected it to be. Maybe a size smaller would work better for length and overall fit. Also, I didn't care for the fabric; it was rough and not comfortable.


Very cute dress. I bought it for my 12 years old daughter. Good fabric and price was excellent.


I absolutely loved the style & quality of the dress, was just too small. It may have been my mistake reading the sizing chart though, so just watch the size chart! I ordered a larger size & am super excited to get it in!!


Nice dress but to big.
