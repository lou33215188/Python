Beautiful dress, well made and the fit is awesome! I'll be wearing it to a wedding in June and I can't wait!


These were beautiful.  The skirt is not as pleated as the picture shows....you would have to add those pleats.


I love this dress. Wore it to a wedding. It fit great and I got lots of compliments!


Great dress  Fit perfect


I LOVE this dress. The color is very bold and beautifully made.


Stunning. I absolutely LOVE this dress!! The blue is gorgeous and I got tons of compliments on this dress. The skirt is nice and full so no need for a petticoat underneath. Great buy!!!


If you like an Audrey Hepburn style dress, you won't be disappointed. 5'6", 155 lbs and I chose the large. Perfect fit. Slightly above is-calf.


Dress was too small, fabric itchy, zipper was poor quality.  No liner (essentially see through).  Very sad this did not work out.  Looked nothing like in picture.


Very cute. Arrived promptly.


The material isn't as flowy and soft and I thought and wanted it to be. It was very stiff and rough. It is very big on me, but I am only 5'1 and 12 yrs old. The length was also a bit longer than I expected, but again, I am 5'1.
