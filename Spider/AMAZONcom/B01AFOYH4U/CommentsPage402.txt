Way too big for a small


Beautiful dress...


this is my second review for an Anni Coco dress and I'm going to keep it simple just like the last one:


size: I am 5.3 and ordered a size small. fits perfectly snug and the ribbon makes it even better in case you need more room.


material: stretchy. I quickly ran my steamer over it and it looks good as new! I love how snug it fits on my waist and has a nice enough poof to wear with or without a petticoat.


quality: thick, well sewn and looks amazing for its price! I love this line now and wish they had more 50s style dresses!


Decent


Excellent


Love it.


I really love this dress. It fits as expected and the length is great. I am 4'11 and 108 lbs, I ordered the small. The material is medium weight, not see through.  I am looking forward to wearing at a wedding in the fall.


I really like this dress - it just has a few quirks. The overall shape fits very well and it is a fun, twirly dress. It just seems like it has a little extra fabric up by the neck (which likely makes it more wearable for people with broader shoulders than me), and the fabric wrinkles pretty easy. It is a very breathable fabric, though. I like it a lot, and will seriously consider getting another one in a different color.


Great dress!


Loved the dress....I would order more that's foe sure..
