This dress is so beautiful. It fits perfectly and the length is just right. I received tons of compliments. I ordered four more colors.


It fit well in the upper body, it's pretty long on me, but I am pretty short. The feel of the material isn't what I respected, I'm curious if it will wrinkle easy, but is is soft enough. I bought the white one to dye yellow to be Joy from inside out for Halloween.


I have never had a dress, off the rack fit as impeccably as this dress does!! I have a friend who used to be a fashion designer and she was amazed at how perfect the bodice fit! That never happens for me!


This dress is beautiful!  I am a very curvy girl with a large bust and this dress really flattered my body (I'm 5'7 210 lbs and wear a 40H bra) The material is nice and stretches to make room for any areas needed. The material is great for the price!  I definitely  recommend this dress!


Very pleased with this dress ğŸ‘—


Too small and see through.


Beautiful dress


Love this dress, fits me like a glove. Be sure to take measurements and order accordingly .
