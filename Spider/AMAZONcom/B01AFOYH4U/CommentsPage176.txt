I NEVER write reviews but I had to for this one! I was very skeptical at first to purchasing this dress but oh my gosh it fits and is super cute! I wear a 12-14 and ordered a size larger so ordered an X-Large to be safe on size and it fits soooo perfect!! Will definitely order more dresses like this!


Love this dress and the material!!!  Item arrived in a timely manner and was just as described!


I  love the dress but the armpit side was a  little bit large but was able to get some one fix it for me.thanks for such a nice dress, I  worn it on  my son's one year birthday, I got so many compliments about it


Attractive, well made, and the perfect style for my figure.


Love this dress it fit perfectly.


And my family loved it as well.


Dress was super cute but even taking the comments into consideration and bumping up a size the dress was impossible to zip without a second person.  As often there is no one else around this is an issue.


The dress is perfect. I am a 16w and the XL says it fits 16-18 and it fit perfectly. The dress looked amazing! I love it!


thank you

Cute dress - got lots of positive comments
