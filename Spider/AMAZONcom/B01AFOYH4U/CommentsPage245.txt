Very cute and flattering dress, especially for the price.


This dress is a gift for my niece for Christmas she loves these types of dresses so I know she will love it


Loved this dress - wore it for a Breakfast at Tiffany's themed bachelorette party and it worked perfectly. I felt so feminine and beautiful!


Love this dress!! Haven't worn it out, only around the house. The color buckles a little in the front and doesn't lay flat but I'm sure putting a long necklace on will help


This dress is pretty, color great, etc. Just didn't fit my body type.. that's all.. I wish it did because I loved it.. would recommend it to others thiugh.


It was longer then expected but still fit great. Like the material and the shape.


Nice simple dress!


I love this dress!!!  Vibrant red, very beautiful.


Not the material that I was looking for as well as the fit.


I would've liked to have seen the material not as heavy/bulky.  I would've preferred a material that flowed a bit.  Love the fit though.
