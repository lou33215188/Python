Fit in most places but was longer than expected. Would be perfect about 2'-3' shorter.


I like my Anni Coco dress...


It's beautifu,,,,I wear small but I bought one size up,,,(medium)I thought it was going to be a little rummy, it wasn't;;; it fit perfectly...


It arrived very quickly.  The dress is nice.


Love the color and the material, and it fits great everywhere, EXCEPT it's a little tight across the chest. If you're busty, you may want to order up a size.


I bought this in a Medium for my mom and it fit her perfectly.


I bought one for myself as well in a small, but the bodice was much too big for my smaller frame, which was disappointing because I loved it otherwise


Dress was fit perfectly on my daughter and arrive on time for her badtism thanks ğŸ˜„ğŸ˜„


Returned it  material very cheap looking

Size not at all as posted. It needs to be returned but not sure how  :(
