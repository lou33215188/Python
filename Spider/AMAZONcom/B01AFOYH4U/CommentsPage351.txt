Well made, good material, just on the small side.


So cute and summery.  Casual and twirls just fine!


Love the dress but I ordered a large and should have ordered a medium.


I love this dress. Will definitely be ordering more in the future. And it arrived surprisingly fast ğŸ˜Š


It was cut small and I order larger to ensure it would fit.


The dress had 2 large faded spots on it. We were kind of disappointed :(


Very nice dress.


Dress was exactly as advertised.


Is somewhat large but is ok.


very nice
