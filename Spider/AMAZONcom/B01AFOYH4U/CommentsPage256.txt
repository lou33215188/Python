Just beautiful!  I'm thinking about ordering a different color :)


Ordered this for my daughter for senior pictures.  You need a slip of you order white.  Very cute and made well for the price.


Beautiful dress just as described,


 nicley packaged.


Beautiful little black dress. Love vintage


Very cute,  just like the photo. Nice material.  Runs small for us bustier gals.  Got it on prime day and it was a steal so won't be returning.


It fit beautifully and my niece loves it.  i'll definitely order again.


Didnt like how it fit on me. Not enough support in mid section. If you want a figure friendly dress I dont recommend.


Absolutely love this dress!  The fabric, the fit, and the pattern! Looks best with a petticoat.


This dress looks great!


The dress didn't fit
