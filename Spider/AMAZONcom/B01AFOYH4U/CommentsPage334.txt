Love this dress!


This little black dress was a perfect fit


Great quality material for a great price!  Love it!


Just order one size up and you're good! An excellent summer dress. Used this dress for first Sunday morning service and everyone loved it!


Fit perfect! Size large. Usually wear a 10. I'm 5'9" and 145


Great design and nice fabric


there is not one thing I can say bad about this dress. I loved the way it fit and the fabric is not cheap. I'd buy again for sure


Fabric is too shiny


Dress arrived as promised, very cute!


I love this dress! Fits true to size and and is super comfortable.
