I love everything about this dress. It's quality material and fits perfectly. I am a size 16, 230 lbs and 5/ 7" and I order a 2X. It worth every dollar spent on the dress.


The dress is very beautiful but unfortunately I was unable to wear it because it was too small. Order a larger size than what you normally wear.


Perfect fit.. even slimming! Pleasantly surprised.


Smaller than the size chart said.  The material is very cheap and feels like a rain coat. I returned this item.


love dress,  but way too small


It looks fantastic on our daughter but it's a little big.


Very flattering upon taking right out of package to try on.  Will be wearing to a black and white gala soon.  Generally wear a 12/14 and dress is a perfect fit


Size was to small for me.  Material didn't look like the picture


Dress was super cute and definitely worth the price! Paired it up with a black petticoat and I felt like Audrey Hepburn!


The product met my expectations, I love the mustard color. I wear a size 16 so I ordered xxl, it fits well and looks good.
