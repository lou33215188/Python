Gorgeous dress! I recommend buying the underskirt for it. Loved it!


Beautiful dress, but ran a little small through the bust. Reviews stated that the material had some stretch to it, but it didn't.


The dress is very pretty.  The only thing is when I took off the dress the zipper broke.


The dress was beautiful and just like the picture, but it was way too large. The dress came below my ankle and looked very awkward, so I returned it. I would still recommend buying this dress, but just order one size smaller then your original size.


This quality is very good


Cute but came very wrinkled


I love this dress.  It's classy and the color was perfect.  The only think I will say is that is comes VERY wrinkled where I took it to the dry cleaners to get presses so the skirt portion would look amazing.  The iron really didn't do the trick.  But other than than.  I love this dress!!!!


Great dress at an amazing price!  Perfect floral print for a spring wedding!


I wanted to give this a 5 Star because it fits my daughter so well. The only issue I had was that the white cake soiled with the red ribbon . I have left it to soak to see if it will come out.


Great fit. Beautiful print. Red sash gave it the extra pop to take it over the top. Excellent quality, especially for the price. Would highly recommend!
