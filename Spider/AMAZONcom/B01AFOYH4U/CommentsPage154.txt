i love these dresses so much that i now have them in white, black, blue, and red. i even bought a white for one of my girlfriends. great quality, fit, and style. a really great bargain!


Beautiful dress but just slightly tighter in the waist than I had expected. It came packaged very nicely and almost ready to wear out of the box with the exception of a few wrinkles. My only real complaint is that the zipper sticks in one spot making it a little difficult to put on and take off.


absolutely perfect and the grade and cut was perfect! not cheap and flimsey looking!  will be doing a reorder or two in different colors. very well pleased with its purchase.


Wonderful fit and a beautiful style.  The only annoying thing was that I could not get all the wrinkles out.  I left it in the bathroom during a few hot showers and I ironed with steam and still could not get them all out.  I am not suzy homemaker so maybe others will have better luck.


I ordered size very carefully after reading the manufacturer size chart and multiple reviews. But it is still strangely tight in the chest. I sized up due even. I'm about finished ordering online as it seems to be an EXPENSIVE GAMBLE!!!


This dress fit but I found the cut to be unflattering. It was too poofy and the armholes are too wide for me.


Beautiful dress and comfortable.


Zipper gets stuck from time to time but dress is beautiful and good material.


This dress is perfect! I love the modest, high neckline and the way it moves when I spin around. The colors are gorgeous.I will be buying this in other colors soon, hopefully. I can't wait to wear this with my heels!!


Exactly how we expected it to be
