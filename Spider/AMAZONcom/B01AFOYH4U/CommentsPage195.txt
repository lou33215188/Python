I LOVEEEEEEEE this dress. It was exactly as pictured. Fit great.!! I got sooo many compliments on this dress. I wore it with a petty coat underneath for more fulness. Very pleased and I will be buying more colors ğŸ’–ğŸ’–.


This dress is super cute on-line, not so much in person


Great for a garden wedding I attended. Not too sexy and not frumpy!


Dress was absolutely beautiful but the dress use was not a true medium. The hips were too narrow


I LOVE the dress, but the zipper once there is any kind of resistance to it, will NOT zip.  I got the correct size so it's not like I am trying to squeeze into something that would not fit either.  I'm really disappointed.


Adorable dress! Got lots of compliments!!


Cheap material but looks great

Cute dress. I only give five stars to things I feel absolutely amazing in. This was close but not perfect. Really classy look.


It's a little tight around the breast area and the zipper won't go all the way down but other than that is beautiful
