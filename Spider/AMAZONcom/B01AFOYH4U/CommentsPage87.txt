I have had dresses of this brand with no problem before, and while it does seem to be a nice dress with quality materials, it simply didn't fit. I'm disappointed, but hey, it's the first of five that were too small as a 2X, so not the end of the world. Cut and material, as my mom would say.


Loved it...its very elegant and yet simple... Iam 5 ft tall so slightly longer on me than usual but i am very happy with the fit...you can dress it up woth accessories or just add a belt and keep it casual.. Very happy with the purchase ğŸ˜Š


Luckily I was able to still wear my dress. It just ended up being a tad bit tight. I absolutely LOVE my dress, though! I plan to buy another very soon!


Quality was less than I anticipated. I should have known from the price but was disappointed. Not awful but not fantastic. Also runs a bit large. I am curvy at 5'6 130lbs and ordered a medium and should've gone small


Lovely dress. I get so many compliments when I wear it. It is a very flattering fit. I will be buying other colors.


Hello. I hope this finds you well. This dress was extremely comfortable. And fit just as I expected it to. I receive a lot of compliments when I wear it. I got mine in blue and it really is lovely.


The dress was way too small, the fabric was cheap, every bulge and ripple stands out in this dress. Totally unflattering unless you are straight like a board. I bought my usual size and could not even zip it up.


This dress is beautiful.  Unfortunately I returned it because it was to small.


Stunning, and fit our daughter like a glove.  The colors are vibrant.  It is an absolutely gorgeous dress.


Amazing dress! I bought a red, black and a black flower patterned one. They fit amazing! Well made! Shipped quick! I got tons of compliments when I wore them. I had three different events I needed a dress.
