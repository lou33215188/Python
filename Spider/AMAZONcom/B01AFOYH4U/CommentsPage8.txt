The dress is made out of really nice material, isn't see through at all and is soft and has stretch to it. He zipper is a bit sticky though. One thing I do not like if the giant seam that runs right down the front of the skirt that I didn't notice until I snipped the tags off to steam out the wrinkles. It makes the skirt lay funny. What is weird is there are four seams, one in the front, back and on both sides... it's strange. Very high waisted as well (which I liked). Falls right at my knees so it is a modest length. Could have went a size smaller. Purchased a medium and could wear the small (would fit better through the chest). If you are in between a small and medium size down.


Gorgeous and classic! Bought the royal blue and it's gorgeous right out of the bag. I'm 5'6" 145lb, 34D, all butt and hips, so the A line cut works great. Get the petticoats!! Don't hesitate buying this, it's so pretty, and made very well! PS I had just woken up to get my package hence the hot mess look ğŸ™ˆ


I ordered the royal blue dress and am very excited. After reading some reviews I ordered a size bigger, but I see now that I have the dress I did not really need it. I will definitely get more from this designer and go a size down and see.  It is roomy and has lots of room under the arms and would be quite accommodating for those who are larger breasted. The material is not satiny like my eyes interpreted but it is a heavier material and far more sturdy for wear. I absolutely love it. Right now I am working on getting the wrinkles out that are just part of the shipping and packing process. I will be wearing it with a petticoat that I also ordered. I was not able to take pics of myself but I was incredibly impressed with the quality of the dress and know this will be quite the hit at work. For the price you absolutely cannot go wrong!


I was beyond surprised when this dress arrived. Yes I was skeptical, could all these reviews be right? I am taking the time to write this review simply to convince someone else as skeptical as me that the reviews didn't lie.  This dress is gorgeous! The colors and material are shockingly beautiful.  If nothing else, spend the $25 and prove me wrong, you'll be as surprised as me.  I cannot recommend this enough.  I bought 5 and I kept them all.  Best gamble i have taken in a while.  I normally wear a small (size 4), but I got a medium and i love it. I could probably go with a small but i'm also good with the medium.


Very cute dress...looks better on than when you take it from the package. Had a strange smell that's why I gave it a four and you will need to wear a petticoat with it to make it full on the bottom.


I generally wear a size 14 and I am very busty and the x large was a great fit. It would probably look better with a belt to help define a waist. I did not wear  any slimming garments.


Love this dress, great quality I bought 7 or 8 of thttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WWPFMS6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0hem it looks amazing. I recommend this dress


Oh Boy !!! This is my 12th  dress YES MY 12th  !!!! I am a plus size 2x and it fits perfect.... Just absolutely LOVE these dressed. same style but each one looks amazing . I feel pretty, look pretty and am very confident as I walk. The thing is the dresses seem to brighten up peoples faces everywhere I go. I think I should stop buying more as I have so many but every time i come back to their link I see a new pattern and just buy it once it my size. The price point is also very affordable. Quality is strong and great fabric. I get compliments every time I wear one of these dresses. I am a Real Estate Agent and use them for work, church, dinner parties  and just because I want to look nice. BUY It BUY IT!!!


Absolutely in love with this dress!!! So gorgeous - I got it for my daughter's graduation, and I can't wait to wear it. I got an XL, and it fits perfectly. I typically wear a L or XL in shirts and a 16 in pants. If you're familiar with LuLaRoe, I wear an XL in the Nicole, for comparison purposes.


Seriously, you can't go wrong with this dress! I got a similar dress from a different seller, and it was made so poorly I had to return it. This came out of the package absolutely perfect. I will definitely check with this seller first the next time I need a dress.  Thanks!!


I love this dress! I love the pattern and the sewing. The length is perfect, and it was easy to wash (several times now.) There have been no loose strings. I got several dresses on Prime day, and each one was perfect! I measured myself and was sad to see I was about a large. Except in the bust area-then I'm not even close...too small. I had read that many large-busted ladies fit into these dresses comfortably, so I purchased this assuming I'd have to take it up in that area. I didn't! The way the cut of the dress works, I can switch to a bra that adds a few cup sizes, and it looks just as good as if I were to wear a thin one. I absolutely feel comfortable in these dresses. It's fun to hear friends and family members express their surprise that I'm in a dress..and more surprise that I'm comfortable in it! I am typically not a dress-wearer. If you wear leggings with this dress, a slip is required. It *will* ride up without a slip. Just a warning: I'm posting this exact review on nearly every dress I purchased that day because I have literally the exact same feedback for each one. I love them! Also-I intend on purchasing more. I love them that much!


Absolutely love this dress. Ordered it for college graduation and an XL fit perfectly on my 5"7, 170 lbs, 38DDDD body. Loved the color.


UPDATE: I already bought a second one, this time in Small and it fits perfectly. I bought the teal geometric pattern and love it.


Both dresses have pretty full skirts even withoutâ€‹ a crinoline skirt. The fabric is thicker than expected, but I see that as a plus. Would it be too much to order another one??!


I love this dress. I've purchased quite a few of these type dresses on Amazon and this is best one so far. I didn't have the wrinkle problems others complained about- it arrived with expected folds, but otherwise fine.


I'm about 5' and 105 lbs, 34A, 26.5" waist- so short, small-breasted, and relatively slender (definitely not stick and bones because I'm no longer in my 20s! Lol). As a guage, I usually wear a P2 or P4. Finding a dress that fits properly is always a problem because I also have a short torso. But this dress works perfectly. I bought the medium because I don't wear my clothesâ€‹ too tight (again, no longer in my 20s :( ). The dress looks fine in medium- hits in all the right places and fitted enough without being tight (I'm pretty sure a size small would have fit me fine if you prefer a tighter fit). Finally, I bought this dress with the blue flowers- just gorgeous. Anyway love this enough that  I'm already thinking about another one.


Hope this review helps someone.
