Fit a little big and had some seams that weren't very pretty, so I haven't worn this yet. However, it is a beautiful color and I can always take it to a tailor.


Fit perfectly. Loved the fabric, the color.


I love the dress and the material.  BUT...the seam that connects the dress top to skirt is too...something.  It is impossible to zip the dress.  The zipper hangs up at this seam and will not be zipped.  I can pull hold the two sides together with several inches to spare.  You would think that would be enough.  Even when the dress is just on a hanger the zipper has issues with that seam.  As I said, I love the dress.  It is a classic style.  I so wanted to be able to wear it to a banquet with a pearl necklace.  Oh sigh.  Not to be.  I had to return it.  And that was a great experience.  Fast. And thank you NO HEADACHE!


love the dress - ran small


My daughter wore this for graduation. It was the perfect dress and she got a TON of compliments on it!


The material is stretchy and it fits perfect. The only downside is you have to iron it because it wrinkles very fast and likes to collect lint and hairs...


I love my dress, good quality, the size fits. the only bad too long but when fixing it is great.


I absolutely love it! I tried it on as soon as it came and it fit amazing! I also bought a petticoat so it would look fuller and I can't wait to wear this on a day trip I'm taking this summer!!! Will definitely be buying in different colors!!!!


very cute dress but i have to return it ...it has a BIG stain on it BUT OVERALL I will recommend it just make sure there is no stain on it


Very plain without the petticoat. Loved the dress not the material I expected but I'm in love with the style.
