Looks just like the picture one of my daughters is wearing it for family picturesğŸ‘Œ


Fit was accurate. Good material, great price! Material a bit tgin but has a very nice sheen. Needs a slip underneath if the dress if wearing the white dress  Daughter was very happy to get it for graduation and said she'd wear it a lot after graduation.


I liked it


I ordered this for my bridal shower and I love it. I ordered a large, based on the reviews saying that it fit pretty true to size, and it fits perfectly. Nice fabric, not cheap looking or feeling at all.


I love that the belt is removable I'm going to make so many belts, and the zipper is still in tact which is rare in an inexpensive dress. I'd totally reccomend this dress and brand :)


Fit very well, different fabric than I thought, but it works.


Lovely dress but it didn't come with the black belt/sash. The dress does need to be pressed due to the material type; steaming will not do. It shipped in perfect time.


Beautiful dress


Beautiful dress, but I underestimated my size ;(.  Had to return it.  Take the advice of the review board and order up a size!


The dress was wonderful but arrived with s broken zipper and I was not able to wear it to an event I bought it for & as s plus size woman my options are few dozen I was very upset because I had nothing to replace it in time and missed my daughters special night
