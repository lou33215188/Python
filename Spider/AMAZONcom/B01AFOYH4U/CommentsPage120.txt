I am extremely happy with my dress. Looks exactly like the picture and is well made.


I purchased this dress for my daughter's formal event and the dress fits perfect, very classy looking.  I would have rated 5 stars but I was unhappy to see the dress balled up in a plastic bag which made the dress very wrinkle and the color white is not really white like in snow white, it's more of a cream color .


The dress is just what I was looking for to wear to a Kentucky Derby themed party. The skirt is very full and the top fits very well. Fabric has a little stretch so it's very comfy.


This a beautiful dress it runs small so order a size up. I plan to order one in every color.  Got lots of compliments.  I love the length.  Wish it came with a belt.


Loved it!  Looked great!  Got many compliments on it being such a pretty dress!


It was perfect I ordered another one the next day! I am in between a 4-6  weight is 148 and I am 5'3 so I ordered a medium


Perfect in every way, with enough stretch.


Loved it! Right size and color. Beautiful.


I did return it because it wasn't quite what I was looking for, but it was sooo cute I almost wanted to keep it to just wear.


I choose the wrong size by mistake, but i really loved the dress. Has a very good manufacturing and the fabric of the dress is good quality.
