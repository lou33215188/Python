Great fabric , great cut totally worth it!


I ordered a 2xl which is what I normally order when shopping online.


The zipper gave some trouble but lovely dress.  Happy I bought.


Beautiful dress!  I am 5'7", 165 lbs, bust size 36DD.  The XL was slightly big but with the belt looked perfect.


I love this dress! It's elegant, comfortable, and fits just right. It's perfect for a night out, or to wear at work.


Fits wonderfully but the zipper is a bit hard to use.


Like a Halloween costume sorta disappointed


This was a great dress! Fit just right! I recommend


Very beautiful dress but not true to size


This dress fits perfect excellent quality
