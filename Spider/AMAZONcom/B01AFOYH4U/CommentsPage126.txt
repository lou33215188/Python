I usually wear a size med ordered a large it fit perfectly order a size up.


We returned this because my daughter chose a different dress, but I really liked it on her.  A really cute and flattering dress!


Fit well on my daughter.


Thin material - wrinkled SO easily. Got rid of it.


Very cool, comfortable, and attractive dress. It is a true circle so you can wear it without the petticoat and still get a nice flair.


Great dress! Bought it for my Grandmother's funeral - her favorite color by far was red. Perfect and fit better than I expected. I'm 5'2" and 140 pounds and got the medium. Also bought a petticoat to go under it, which worked well because my dress flew up with a stiff breeze. The petticoat also gives it a more dramatic flair.


Love this dress!! I did have it hemmed a couple of inches because of my height, but it's absolutely beautiful.


I probably shouldve got one size up to accomodate for the chest and waist, but otherwise, it is a very nice dress.


The dress is beautiful. The red bow made the dress perfect for a Christmas party which is what I bought it for. It is a little tight in the bust but Iâ€™m quite large in that area and would probably be fixed by me using a different bra.


This dress is simply beautiful and classy!  The fit is perfect.  I'm a 38DDD. I ordered a XL. The slight stretch is exactly what I needed.  I was so flattered with this dress that i bought it in ALL colors! Side note, I bought the puffy slip to wear under this dress and it makes it even more flattering.
