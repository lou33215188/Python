Love the dress; the fit was perfect. However, the red dye from the sash colored my dress slightly. Sash should be packaged separately.


I can't believe this dress cost only $28. Very flattering dress especially with a crinoline petticoat underneath. A definite keeper!


Returned. Did not fit as expected.


Very nice dress. Flows well and fitted bodice accents waistline. Unfortunately I need a larger size. My mistake. Looks great from the front but my back is wide and zipper will not close all the way.  Length is fine - I am 5'5" and dress comes just below knee.


Perfect for a stage show! Great fit and price!


Super cute dress.  Can be dressed up for a fancy occasion or dressed down for an everyday occasion.


Love this dress, feel classy wearing it.  Wore it with a petticoat and it poofed it up just right.  Would purchase again in other colors, love the style and cut of the dress.


Absolutely loved it. It said it ran a little small so I went up a size and it was perfect.  I got so many compliments on it at the wedding I was at.  I think I'm going to order it in black.


Loved the dress for the pricing!! Very true to size, would recommend going up a size of in between. considering purchasing more in different colors. Dress is not lined (not expected at this price) will need a full slip for lighter colors. Would purchase again.


Nice dress.  Looks exactly like picture.  Ran a little big on me.  I am very petite at 4'11 and 110 pounds but the shoulder area was a little loose.
