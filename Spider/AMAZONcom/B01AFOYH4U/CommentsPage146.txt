Dress needed for youth group ages 10 and up. Ordered various sizes. Color, length and type of fabric were exactly as described. You must order according to your body measurements and not your usual dress size.


I love my dress!


So lovely! It fits perfectly (followed the size chart) and I love the color. Great vintage style dress.


I was very impressed by the wonderful quality of the fabric.  I thought it would come in looking cheap but it was quite the opposite.  Im very happy with my purchase and plan on buying more dresses from Anni Coco in the future.


Inexpensive charm . It just was to tight . I have curves so it was way to tight across the chest ! This is a dress with charm that can be set off with a  colorful wide belt , just a splash of bling and stabbing pumps !! Yesssss


Dress is really beautiful.  Sewing was done very well. Fabric colors look bright and nice. Exactly like the picture!


A winner.  Nice, solid, but stretch material.  Lays very well on full body woman.  Flows beautiful.


Exceeded my expectations! I loved it so much i bought another one a few days later ğŸ™ŒğŸ�½


This didn't really fit as I was hoping for it too, it was the right length but even the small was too large for my frame. It looked really very lovely on the ladies in the photos, but definitely requires a belt.


The dress is of good quality for the price. The fit is a little tighter than I'd like but I definitely will buy more dresses like this from now on.
