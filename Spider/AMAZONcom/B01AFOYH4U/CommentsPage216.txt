I loved this dress.  It was a little short wasted on me, but most dresses are. I wore a belt it looked perfect.  The quality if the dress is amazing.  I will order from this seller again.


The dress looks great. Good material. Great quality.


I love this dress!!!! It came ripped tho. The zipper was broken at the bottom. I loved it to much to send it back. So if you buy this dress please get safety pins or sewing kits.


Great dress!  Fabric is a little stretchy. I ordered an XL and am about 5'4" and weigh almost 180 lbs.
