I purchased  three dresses of this style, for a Christmas Party.  This dress was the winner.  If fits beautifully and onvei put my petticoat on,  my mouth  dropped in awww.  The material was scary but  it works.  Therefore, I am ready to turn some heads and have some interesting conversations about my attire with the ladies. ğŸ˜‰


This dress was PERFECT! We needed a 50s dress and the  fit was perfect with no alterations required. The price was cheaper than me making it.


SO happy with this dress. I was afraid the material would feel cheap but it doesn't. I'm 5'6" and 145 lbs and a large fits great... Maybe the teeny tiniest bit big but that's perfectly fine because a medium probably would have been tight.


Love it!  Bought a medium.  I am 5'10" and 130 lbs.  Fits great and the price is unreal.  I'm going to wear it to my husband's work event and no one will know it was $25 on Amazon. The (inexpensive) jewelry I'm wearing with it cost more.


Disappointed.. if you expect the dress to look like the one pictured you will not be happy.


The torso is shorter than it is pictured an no way enough material in skirt to flair or hang this way.. wrong type of material for style ..ugh..i purchased the solid black one.


I got this for my daughter..right at 6 ft shes a stick (i tease her) but not as skinny as a runway model. (But shes had offers to model) shes got legs.


So usually clothes look like they hang displayed on her.


Mostly she has to worry about length due to her being tall.


If you look at torso on dress in ad it looks fairly adequate but appears shorter on larger busted women in their personal images posted which led me to believe this was a lovely little dress well proportioned and would be no issue.. the style is cute.. i got the medium according to the chart ..


the material in dress i received is just wrong for this style.


It is short waisted (shes not large busted ) and doesnt shape flair or hang well (yes she has a small waist) but cant send back because plastic package got destroyed opening and tossed in trash before realized the dress was unusable.. it was so wrinkled she decided to try steam shower later reduce wrinkles to make it look better once she got home and would hang better.. she sent me pics of it when she tried on after her shower..


I wont embarrass her by posting them here.. i bought because of style and so many seemed pleased (by ratings).. dress looks elegant in ads.. in real life.. not so much..

Fit great, I got lots of complements. I wore a petticoat underneath and a dress belt


Ice dress but it runs smaller than small


I don't think I've ever order a dress so close to an event with hopes it would fit like a dream. I'm 5'8 140# ordered a large as the other reviews suggested ordering up from normal size. It was slightly Big in the waist but perfectly perfect with the ribbon belt. Tons of compliments - easily ironed out of package.


Beautiful dress! Exactly what I wanted.  Nice material, looks exactly like thr picture. Would definitely recommend and order again!


I'm so in love with this dress!!! I cannot even explain to you the happiness that it brings me. I know it's a simple black dress but this style is just everything.
