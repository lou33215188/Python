Very hard to get the wrinkles out.


Great fit! For your reference. I'm 5'4 155lbs size 32Bchest. I wear 10/12/ Med or Large in dresses. I ordered a Large and it fits perfectly. Knee length for me. The reviews really helped me so I hope this helps someone else...


I ordered larger than I needed and it was still to small. Also arrived wrinkled and smelling kinda funky.


Beautiful dress, look just like the picture


Love this dress!  Material was quality, not thin or costume like at all. The fit and sizing was also right on.


The dress does have the flair and the material is such that even if you don't wear an additional skirt underneath to make it more full, the shape is there and when you are dancing it swings well.


Will buy from them again.


Fits perfect


I ordered two to try different sizes. As stated above I'm returning the dress. Even so, I thought both were well made, packaged nicely and arrived in a timely manner. May buy again in the future when I've lost a bit more weight.


It was a beautiful dress, but I had to return it as I decided it was not the dress I wanted to get married in.


Beautiful material and workmanship! The only complaint I would make is that the torso is a bit too short (I read this in other reviews as well)--the waistline is about an inch too high. A belt covers the problem just fine, but I would have preferred to have it fit at my waistline. Still, a great dress : )


The dress is beautiful.  I was disappointed that it came with a zipper that was completely broken.  If the garment had been inspected, it would have been noticed.  I saw it before I even opened the package.  If the zipper had been in tact, I would have given it 5-stars.
