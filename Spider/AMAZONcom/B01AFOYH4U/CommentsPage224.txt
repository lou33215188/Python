Dress was good quality for the price, and better than I was expecting based on other reviews. There are belt loops, but no belt so you either have to add you own belt or remove loops because they are obvious. Nice and light for summer.


Love love love this dress. I ordered the size a 4xl and it fits perfect. Will be ordering another style shortly.


This is going from 5 stars to 2 because while it fits well and is very pretty, the zipper is a cheap zipper and broke my second time wearing it.


The neckline was too high, otherwise would love the heck out of this. Classic style and well made.


I'm 5'3" and dress is calf-length.  Fabric is stiff-ish but not the worst...  maybe like a cheap bridesmaid dress.  Arrives SO wrinkled.  Yellow color is pretty and neckline is very nice.  Did not flatter my waist.


My 13 year old daughter loves these dresses. Bought it for a church retreat, and she loves it. Fits perfectly, true to size.


Perfectly I am a size 38d and about an 18 jeans and I got an xl and it fit perfectly! And looks amazing!


Pretty pattern but the material felt like a shower curtain


I love this show dress! The dress fits my body very well. The colors are beautiful on me and the style is all me!! Love Anni COCO's 50's style.  I will be purchasing other garments from her.


Way to small. Had to return this item. It's about 3 sizes smaller than what you order.
