Really cute dress but ran a bit small for me in the ribcage, and I wear as size 2 or 4. Would try it again in a larger size.


Great dress


I love it, it's look great


I loved the dress ... but XL is sized to fit a teenager, not a mature woman ... I have given the dress away ...


I'm 5' 3" tall, 130 lbs, 35" Bust. Bit stretchy, bought M. Falls 4/5 inches just below the knees. Fits like a GLOVE. PERFECT, Very Happy ''Love it, can't wait to wear it to a Car Show..


Love it! Great fit and beautiful color. The zipper is a little cheap and it is not lined, but for the the price it's great.


She was the prettiest woman at the Big Bad Voodoo Daddy concert.  Thank you


Worked great for graduation!


Love the dress. It was a little bigger than expected, but just added a belt to it in leopard print. It's fits beautiful.


Too small
