Fits perfectly. Lays nicely. Has a bit of stretch in it. Made well. I received a number of compliments on it.


Cute dress


Loved this dress and it fit perfectly.  Color was just as depicted on line.  Beautiful, brilliant Royal Blue!


This dress would be so cute but the designers assumed my boobs would be directly below my collar bone. My boobs however are where they usually are on female anatomy, and I am left with saggy void space in the fabric above them. If you have plastic Barbie boobs these may be right for you.


I ordered a size bigger than what I needed and it was still to small. Feels like cheap fabric.  Mostly cotton? Nope. Whatever that fabric is not cotton.  Not spandex either. No give room. Does not breath.


the material was not as nice as shown on pic. I thought the dress was not great and is too big for me 5'3 102# in S.  It probably will fit someone better who is taller and little heavier. return it .


I love this dress....run small hsd to get xl i am 5 6 ....172 lb...i bought 5 in different colors..I would buy more love the material ğŸ’›


As a sleeveless dress it fits akwardky. The size runs true, but the cut at the arms as a sleeveless isn't attractive.


Fabric is OK.


Dress size was just as expected. I'm 5'2 @ 138lbs and dress fit great! It does have some stretch to it. I felt very classy but sexy wearing it in a 50's era kind of way. I would recommend it. I definitely wouldn't have a problem ordering another color. I received it in 2 days with the prime membership. I ordered it on Monday and it was in the mail by Wednesday afternoon.


This dress is beautiful! Beyond in love with it. Fits perfectly and looks amazing with the crinoline under it.
