It's great looking and it's fit great


Didn't keep it -- just a personal preference, but it was OK.


Prefect


True to its description. Looked great on me


Everything you hope it will be!!


I bought this dress for my nephews wedding and it was perfect! I am 5'2 180lbs and it was flattering and very comfortable!


This dress is just ok


Not white, off white


Fits good


Going to all white party hope I'm not only one with off white dressâ˜º


Did not come with ribbon belt as advertized.


The dress fit was a little snug.  But I was able to wear the dress.
