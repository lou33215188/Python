I loved this dress. I wear a curvy 18 and ordered an XL.


Gorgeous dress!


runs small and needs to be pressed a lot


I loved the color of the dress, but it was the wrong size.


Wonderful fits great!!!!


Love it


Beautiful dress! Very well made! My daughter LOVES it!!


It fit perfect, loved it.


Material was very translucent and looks like a bed sheet.


It fits me but its way too tight around my arms.
