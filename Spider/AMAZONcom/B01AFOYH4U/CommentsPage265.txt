The fabric is nice and study.  It's a good pretty dress. I would buy it again in the future.


I am so happy with this dress, you will love it too


The lady I bought this for since it is absolutely gorgeous. She was surprised at how very well made it is.


This dress is beautiful, the material is perfect and i like the stretchy feel to it.  I will purchase in different colors.


Terrible. Too long, too big everywhere but the waist and I have a small waist. Was like wearing a black trash bag that smelled like dye


The dress fit as I expected.  Can't wait to wear it!


Zipper broke a soon as I put it on. And no not because it was too small.


Great dress, so beautiful and form fitting. It's great. Just be careful with you deodorant cause mine transferred quite a bit onto the dress


im a 14 and bought the xl (16/18), I'm a little busty and it fit snug around the chest area, fit great everywhere else and looks beautiful


Black with a little shine to it. Well made and fit to size. Bought a crinoline to go under.  Made it really cute.
