The colors in the dress are beautiful.  The top fits perfectly,  but the waist is about 5 inches too high.  The proportions are way off as far as the waist is concerned.  I don't believe I can ever wear it.... which is disappointing.  I am 5'8" and weigh 155 lbs.


I absolutely love this dress it was perfect for our Breakfast at Tiffany Baby Shower


The fabric is lovely and the skirt fullness is spectacular. It is slightly too large on me. I'm 5'8", 160ish and have a 28" waist. I ordered a Medium and now wish I ordered a Small. The fabric has really nice give and would have been a perfect snug fit if I'd gotten a Small.


Beautiful dress! Fits nicely and I am very happy with this purchase! Thank you


This dress is beautiful. I really love the color and it was exactly as explained in the description. The length was perfect and I have gotten so many compliments about how classy it looks.


Dress was as expected will be using it for a halloween costume this year


Transparent and cheap looking. My daughter couldnâ€™t wear it not even once.


Very pretty but cut smaller than anticipated.  I wear a 12/14. Ordered a 3x to be safe and it's too small. Not true to size.


LOVE THIS DRESS - I will be purchasing more from the designer. Amazing quality, I purchased a size small, I am a size 4 (small chested) and it fit perfectly!


Beautiful color.  Fabric used for waist tie has enough heft to hold the tie.  Easy to care for.  Size very true to size charts.  Love the dress.
