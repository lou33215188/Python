I absolutely LOVE the style of this dress - but I got the white one for a specific occasion and ended up having to return it because it was SO see through.  It was lightweight and comfortable - I will buy another color!  If it wasn't see through it would have gotten 5 stars from me instead of 3.


UPDATED:  I returned the white and bought the same dress in black and it's perfect!  I added the petticoat underneath and I can't wait to wear it!


It is really a beautiful dress that it can be wore casual or in a formal event with sone accesories . The size is larger than the chart. My daughter wears a medium size. I ordered the Large following the chart measures but it runs a little larger. It can be fixed. Other than that it is beautiful and my daughter lovea it.


Cute dress! I normally wear a medium but bought the XL, which fits perfectly. I love the dress and am complimented on it every time I wear it. The only bad thing is that it's cotton and wrinkles very easily. I find I wear it less because of that.


This dress is adorable! Itâ€™s very flattering and fits perfectly. I purchased it based on the positive reviews and reviewers pictures. Great buy at a great price! Exactly what I was looking for for a couple of upcoming weddings that I have to attend.


Wonderful dress, but the one I received was not even all around, one side was longer than the other. I had to cut to make it even all around which made the dress shorter in length


Ordered this for a beach wedding and was very pleased! It is made very well and the fabric is lightweight, flowy and comfortable. It fit as expected even with my DDD chest! Would buy again in different colors/patterns!


This is such a comfortable and sweet dress!  I was skeptical about ordering a dress in "XL" sizing but this fits like a dream! Well made with a hidden zipper.  I typically wear a size 14/16 (bust size 38D) I bought this for an evening bar mitzvah, but because of the more casual material, I don't think its dressy enough, but will be perfect for graduation parties.


Enjoy!


BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL. I have never had a dress that was so flattering to my figure before. Got the red and cobalt blue, both colors were spectacular. Can't say enough how great this dress is and the price I got it for.


OMG... The dress was amazing and I received many compliments on this dress. I am not a lover of all white but my awesome cousin who was like a sister to me passed. The request from the family was to where all white for our special angel in heaven. Thanks again for the awesome dress and other colors of this dress is calling my name. ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜‰


I LOVE this dress. The material is very soft, thicker than I expected and slightly stretchy. It does not look or feel cheaply made. I have worn it many times and continue to get complicates on it every time I wear it!


Pros: fits great, comfortable


Cons: the back is slightly to long and almost bunches at the top of my neck
