Fits perfectly. I love it.


The dress is beautiful, color is gorgeous!  Fits perfectly!


Dress run very small. Pretty dress though wish would have fit.


This dress was perfect!


Quality made, it's classic-it hits right below the knee for someone that is average height. I'm wearing this to a wedding I'll be attended so I wish it was just a smidge glitzier, but I bought a beaded belt for it. It's a great dress at a great price!


Bought the white dress-


The material is cheap looking and the dress is all wrinkled up.


The dress is almost see through with very think material.


I liked the style. It fits me. I didn't like the material. It makes lots of wrinkles and hard to remove.


A little tight,  pretty


Pretty good fit, tight right under my bust. Fabric is a bit stiff but great colors.


I love it .....I just wish the material would've been softer .
