I am disappointed in this dress.  The product description said white, but the is a false description,  it is off white. I did see another patron bought it and said that it was a white dress, but mine is not, so I am returning it.  My daughter needed it for an important teen conference and this company has failed us.  I am giving it a one star for the false description.


Nice dress


Love it and wore it to a wedding reception and everyone loved it!


I was going back and forth as far as the size- I am 5'6- 135 lbs, 36C bra. I typically wear a six in dresses so I went with the medium. I could wear it but it was a little big. Ordered another in a size small just to see which fit better and it was the small.


Love


Great quality and form fitting . Really like this dress. Very flattering


Love this!!!


This dress is so perfect for me I could cry. Perfect fit, heavy enough material that it feels sturdy but not heavy. Highly recommend!


Loved this dress! It fit as I expected it to but was so nervous from the other reviews. I wore this to a New Year's Eve gala & got SOctober many compliments. You do need a belt or something to jazz it up but it was perfect! The only very small complaint that I have was that it wrinkled easily. Great dress! And even better for the price!


Cute
