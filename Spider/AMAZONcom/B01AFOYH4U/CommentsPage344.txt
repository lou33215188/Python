I love this dress


Great dress and so inexpensive!


Dress material felt like paper


The zipper broke the first time it was unzipped after trying on.


I love this dress. It is simple and dainty. I am wearing the dress to my cousin's wedding. Nice cotton material with a little stretch.


Material is kinda weird. Size is a little off. It will still work for the one evening I need it for.


Amazing fit and quality is very nice will buy another color .


Love this dress.


Comfortable and adorable!


not what expected
