For the price, this is great.  It does look on the cheaper side, though.  The fabric is thick and rough, and it has a slight sheen to it that gives away the lower quality.  I would not feel comfortable wearing this to an actual event; it would be best for a costume.


I was a little hesitant to purchase this dress, after carefully reading the reviews I purchase it. I was pleasantly surprised. It fit very well according to the size guides and I got a lot of compliments from younger and older generations of people who have class. Shipped rather quickly.


Was perfect for "Havana Nights" party.  Loved this dress and wore a petticoat under it.


I've bought 4 of these dresses and love them. However, the zippers break very easily. Be careful!


Love,love,love the dress. Simple, elegant and a perfect fit. Can dress it up or down. Already bought another color.


I wasn’t a fan of the material. Dress fit too big and too long for my height 5’5”.


I absolutely LOVE this dress!  I wore it to an art opening.  My only issue is the waist line rose up due to my larger bust size.  The cut is more for a C or D cup not higher.  Even still, I adore the dress and wear it with a wide belt to hide the rise in waist.  Paired with a rockabilly petticoat, it looks stunning!  Wear a black cardigan to dress it down and without the petticoat.


Great find.  Great Price.  Well made.  Love the color!


Lovely dress in Amazon's picture. If it was poor, and it was poorly constructed. I had to return this  unfortunately


Great dress. I'm 5'10 so finding a  dress that's close to knee legnth or feels like it's not going to be too short on the back is hard but this is a great legnth.


This is the perfect dress.  It fits me smooth as a glove, accentuates my full figured body .  I look really good in it.  I want more dresses like this in my wardrobe.
