My wife loved it but we should have ordered +1 size. Large ran little small, but still recommends.


Disliked how hard it was to steam out the wrinkles. Loved how comfortable it was, made it through a friends wedding and the rest of the after party. Looks great with a petti coat.


Was very happy!


Well made, looks great!


Material is comfortable with just a touch of stretch so you can breathe but still look great.  Very classy styling.  Dress it up or down depending on the event.


Absolutely love this dress! My sister in law is obsessing over it and going to order one for herself now! It's a beautiful dress for a great price!!


Perfect fit! Great quality.


I will order another one or two ğŸ˜€ In other colors.  Love it!!!!!


Had to return.  It was much to small even though I ordered one size up.


Love the material. Longer than I expected but fit well.


It was to small sending back
