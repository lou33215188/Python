Loved the fabric. Cute dress. Well-made. Style just didn't fit right for me, but great dress otherwise.


Had a problem with the zipper. It needed replacing. I am not happy with this dress


Fit of dress is good, nice material. The overall color of this dress is more orange than pink.


Its ok


I gave it to my daughter who wears a 8/10 and it fits her really nice; will alter just a little along the top sides but it's too cute and I don't want to hassle with returning it. However, I will if I have others and she decides she doesn't want it.


Not super great, although it fit alright. The material is not ideal, and it was a little longer than expected. It low-key makes me look like a witch


I have had so many compliments on this dress today. It fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable.


Its really pretty a bit of issue with ZIPPER but I love it.


Bought this for my teen daughter for 50's dance. It good quality and price! The length and size was as expected. She absolutely loved it!


Exactly as expected, fits well, true to size.  enough flair at the bottom that a petticoat is not needed.
