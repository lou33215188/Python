I got so many compliments! I did get the black slip for underneath to make I puff out make it a bit interesting since I ordered the white. The white was truly white too!


The packaging was all wrong the dress was white  and it had a red stripe straight down the dress that was supposed to be my red ribbonğŸ˜¤


Fit as expected. On my 5'8" daughter it went to her knees. Washes well.


The dress was perfect for my court wedding with a petticoat underneath. It was a little too big on the top portion but the skirt was perfect. It was pretty wrinkled when I got it, but using a steamer and an iron got it smooth in no time.


Material seems low quality cotton and is see thru. Dress is nothing special in person. Will be returning it. Disappointed with this purchase.


Wish this was had been bigger.  Wasn't able to wear it but I had already taken the tags off :/


Its also more poofy on the bottom than I had expected.


The dresses were perfect for a performance we are doing we had one problem.  I ordered 1 extra large, 3 medium and 5 extra small.  I received 2 extra large and only 4 extra small.  I had to do some alterations because there was not enough time to send it back.  So shipping and handling was our problem but the dresses were great


Very feminine and pretty. I'm glad other reviewers had suggested that I order up a size when buying this style. If I had ordered my usual (U.S.) size I would have had to return it. That being said, it's a classic dress that I should be able to wear for years.


Lovely dress!!! A bit tight across the bust but other than that it fit well!!


Very nice dress, but ended up being a little too small
