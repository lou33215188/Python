Love love love love it!!!! Sizing is accurate. Such a comfortable and gorgeous dress. I think I need one in every color!!!


I would recommend  ordering a size bigger than you are. And wearing a petticoat underneath helps the flow of the dress


Beautiful.....


This is my first review of a product.  I love this dress!  I bought it as a work dress and it is so classy, feminine, and beautiful.  It fits wonderfully and I am very pleased with my purchase.  I am tall (5'10") and a size 12.  Great purchase!


Very pretty, true to color advertised. Will be getting another in a different color soon.


Love this dress--very comfortable and I must say for the price--GREAT!


The dress is gorgeous and fit me perfectly. This is my third dress from the company and I couldn't be happier! Looking forward to wearing it at my reunion


Dress is gorgeous! I love it and it fits perfectly


Love this dress. The neck is a little large but it usually isn't a problem


It's a beautiful dress. Sized a little on the small side. Hopefully my daughter still fits it for our wedding. Crossing fingers.
