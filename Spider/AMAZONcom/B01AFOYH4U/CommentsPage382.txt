Perfect fit, looks amazing!


It is as cute in person as it is the photo, the dress fit as expected based on the reviews. I am returning because the torso of the dress is too short for my shape. I am a curvy busty woman: 36 DDD and size 14 pants for obvious reasons. I found that the flare of the dress should have started somewhere near my belly button, since it was above it, the flare made my belly look bigger than it is. That one flaw in the dress is why I'm returning and rating 4 stars instead of 5.


Poor quality


Perfect fit!

Such a gorgeous dress! I fell in love with it the moment that a put it on. So elegent


Haven't try it on.. But love the dress and the fabric


Zipper broke the second time I wore it.


I purchased a large and it fits great! I'm going to order in other colors.


Love the dress. Looks exactly as shown. Fits as size says. Couldn't be happier!
