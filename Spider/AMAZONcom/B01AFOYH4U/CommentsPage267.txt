I love this dress!! It's true to size and fits perfectly! I can't wait to wear it for our engagement party!!


Beautifully crafted, wonderful material and a perfect fit! Had to get a second one in another color! Love it


The zipper broke the day I put it on. It was not too tight and had a nice stretch but kind of heavy material


It fits exactly as it should and it's so nice! Order a petticoat, too, and it'll be absolutely perfect!


The dress was nice my daughter really liked it.


Lovely dress


Love it and the fit!


This dress is made of a strong material and fits perfect. I was a little worried seeing a few reviews saying it was too small or too big. Arrived on time and I am very pleased.


I really liked the fabric and style of this dress however it didn't fit me perfectly so I'm returning it. I'm going to order one size smaller.


Dress runs big...I ordered a small and it fit like a medium...other than that; great product
