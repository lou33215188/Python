Beautiful dress


Muy bueno!


I was disappointed with this dress. The skirt was a lot longer than I thought and came down midway between my knees and ankles (I was expecting more of a knee length skirt). I'm 5'4" and so having a dress this long can tend to make me look a bit frumpy. The top part of the dress was also big and the seam between the skirt and the bodice came to a weird place on me and was not very flattering.


The dress is a beautiful color and seems to be good quality fabric, but I was disappointed that it did not look that great on me.


Fit was good and I like the swing of the skirt.
