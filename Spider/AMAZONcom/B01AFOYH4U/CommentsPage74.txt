Small in the bust.  The zipper also had a couple of snags.  If you are small busted, you might like this dress.  The zipper was snaggy in a couple of places.


The dress is really nice! The material is lightweight and as others have said- it will definitely need a GOOD iron! I do want to note that this dress is NOT BRIGHT WHITE. I was hoping it was and from the reviews I thought it would be, but it's not. It's between a bright white and cream. It's not even a winter white...the color is hard to explain. But ita closer to bright white than anything...


 Anyways, I love it- wearing it right now!


Daughter wears a small and it fit her perfectly. Ordered also the â€œcan-canâ€� slip to make it stand out. She loves it and so do I. I will be ordering again ty!


Previous reviews said that this ran small so I ordered a couple sizes up and it's a good thing I did. It was a perfect fit. Love the style of the dress and the quality of the material. I received many compliments on it.


Dress is lovely. Size was perfect. Dress well made. Quality of fabric very very nice. Will buy more of your products.


Shipped well.  So nice to receive a garment that has been packed carefully with only a few wrinkles . Shows care


and attention to details. Thank you !!!


I love the fit and flare of this dress.  I ordered the XL, which is my typical size.  It runs a bit large on me and that's because I am sort of in between sizes.  I will wear this dress for a more formal setting, but it definitely exceeded my expectations.  Will look for other similar dresses.


Super cute! Its like a  retro style cinderella dress- as that is what my coworkers have deemed it.Though Does not come with a black ribbon belt as pictured! So just be sure you are aware of that :)


I bought this dress to wear to a wedding.  After reading the reviews I decided to buy a large and I'm glad I did. It has some stretchy Ness to it which makes it very comfortable.  I'm planning on getting orher colors.


It was my first time buying clothes online and I was hesitant, but I really fell in love with the dress. I am 1,74cm and 67kg and I bought the medium. It fit perfectly! I also bought a petticoat. It can be worn without it, but I like it because it makes me feel like a princessğŸ˜Š I have gotten so many compliments with this dress and it makes me feel fabulous. And it makes great twirls when I spin around dancingğŸ˜Š


Great product. Fit just as expected based on the measurements provided. And a lovely dress for a very reasonable price.


I will definitely be shopping for more Anni Coco dresses!
