I have a hard time finding dresses that fit. I had a wedding to go to and needed a dress to wear. I ordered this one and fell in love with it!  The style is just so classy. I added a white belt as an added accessory.


Fit was on point, beautiful color, wore well through the night. I wore this dress to a wedding and received so many compliments! Very happy with this purchase. Thank you!


It's ok, to me the picture is prettier than the actual dress that arrived.


I was worried about the fit, but it was perfect! The material is great and with a quick iron, the dress is ready to go!


Not very flattering if you have a couple of extra pounds. But would be really cute for a slender woman


Absolutely LOVE this dress. Just get a size bigger than what you usually wear


Love this dress.


Fabulous dress and good quality.


Poor quality construction, fabric and especially the zipper. We have ordered from another vendor on Amazon called Muxxn and will stick with them from now on. Dress returned.


The dress is a great deal and is very flattering. The skirt is pretty lifeless though, so you will likely need to iron and add some volume.
