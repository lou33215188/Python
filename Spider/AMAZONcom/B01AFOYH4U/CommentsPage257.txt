Great dress. Bought one of the full slips on here to make it poof out on bottom, which made it even cuter.


The dress fit well but the fabric is not that I expect I thought the quality was better


Zipper split just trying to try it on, not cut ordered, I expected it to be a little cheap with price but wasn't expecting THAT cheap


I absolutely loved this dress. Wore it for a Kentucky Derby party. Fit perfectly. Im 5'10 and it went to just slightly below my knee. Great fit and super comfy.


The dress fit very well and was of the quality we expected.


Purchased as a costume for the musical Grease (prom scene).


Being of a certain figure, I can only dream of looking pretty in a dress with a defined waist.  However, I have a sister with a lovely figure.  When I fell in love with these dresses, I decided to send one to her for her birthday.  It is so beautiful!  We were skyping as she opened it.  She loved the give in the material...almost a stretchiness, the length was just below her knee, the arm holes didn't have the normal gap where you try and pretend your bra isn't showing.  In a word, the dress is PERFECT...and the price is AMAZING!  It arrived with Prime promptness.  Oh so happy with this purchase!


Exceeded my expectations!! Purchased this dress last minute for a special occasion. The dress fit perfectly, light weight, and well sewn. I  plan to purchased another dress but in a different color.


I love the dress but i wish i would of gotten one size larger, my boobs fell smashed in.


Fit perfectly! What a great value!
