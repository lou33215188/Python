Very comfortable. The material is good and stretchy.


The dress fit great!  The fabric is a little thin, but still looks great.


Dress fits perfectly.  Quality of material and construction better than what I expected for the price.


Love this dress! It can be dressed up or down.


Beautiful dress


Beautifully made. Better than I was expecting to be honest.


The dress is so pretty, flattering and true to size. If you're busty, I would buy a size up. I got sooooo many compliments on my dress. I wear a L and bought the large and was perfect for me. I danced in it all night for a shower and was comfortable.


Loved it


Very cute on even a plus size girl.


Love this dress.
