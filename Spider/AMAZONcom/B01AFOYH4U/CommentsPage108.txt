I bought this dress to complete a costume.  The level of quality was much higher than I anticipated.  I will likely wear it after the costume party. I honestly have never spent less than 20 bucks on a dress. Wow


I got the orange one to be Mama Pig for Halloween! I only wore it once but great quality and super flowy! I'd get it again!


Ok. This dress is amazing.  Beautiful. Well made. Good quality for the price. Arrived on time. I do wish the belt had a buckle though. I used good foundation garments, added a petty coat and kitten heels. As a post partum size 14, it fit great.


This dress is so pretty!


Very pretty but I'll return it. It looked weird on me.


I have this dress in two patterns/fabrics and I love them both. Very comfortable, great length, and a good price for a retro dress. I always feel great wearing them and get lots of compliments.


The fabric is made from some type of rubber/plastic mix that smells and feels like a swimming pool liner. The fabric is very shiny and will cause you to sweat on a hot day. It says made of 95% cotton but I couldn't find any cotton.


This dress was absolutely fabulous!  I ordered a size up due to the online information provided.  That made all the difference.  Nothing but compliments all night.


I bought according to the size chart. It was beautiful but small. had to return it. very disappointed


Love the dress but sizing was not consistent. I purchased the dress in black and blue. The blue dress fit tighter than the black. I'm still satisfied with my purchase and can't wait to wear my dresses.
