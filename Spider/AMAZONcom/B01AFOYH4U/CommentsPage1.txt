This dress is so cute, definitely a great deal for the price! I am 5'9" and 128lb, and I ordered the medium, which fits perfectly.  The skirt hits right at my knee.


Most of us loved this dress! My dress is a Large and I loved it on my body. Its very classy and sexy. It arrived in 2 days on a Sunday too. I put the dress in the cleaners before I wore to my event because I didn't want the crease to be shown. The ladies of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. wore it well.


This dress fit perfectly. I'm 5'9 165lbs and I purchased a Large fit me perfectly!! It's actually WHITE not off white as 2 other dress I have purchased. Comes to my knees and falls perfectly without petticoat. A slip is needed.


Cute dress


I absolutely love this dress, classic, and stunning. I bought the 22" pettiskirt along with. The dress falls a little flat without it. The pettiskirt fills it out beautifully without it being huge and in the way.


Perfect and very classy for any occasion. I particularly purchased for a Black Tie event as a cocktail dress. I also purchased a petticoat to make it flare and swing. Love this dress!!!


This dress is amazing.  You can dress it up or down.  I am 5'6", 235 lbs and it fit me perfect.  It irons easily.  I wish there were more colors.  I would own them all.  Very good quality material.


Absolutely beautiful. I used it for a pin-up competition and got tons of compliments. Only complaint is that the zipper gets caught where the seam overlaps. I ordered a 2x and I'm normally an 18/20. Will be ordering more colors asap!


I love this dress! It's even more perfect with a petticoat! I got so many compliments on it!


I am 5'7 and a size 14 top, 16 bottom.  I have three of these dresses and all are an XL. Fit great! The dress goes a little below my knees, which I love. Will be ordering more.
