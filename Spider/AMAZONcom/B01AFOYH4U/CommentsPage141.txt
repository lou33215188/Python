This dress was a hit, hugged me in all the right places. What u need to focus on is the upper body part, if u are big breastfed and around the armpit. Apart from that this can be worn with or without the petticoat and still looks sophisticated. Will be purchasing some more. Can't seem to upload a pic.


Everyone said it ran small so I ordered a lg. Way to big. I am a 9/10, I loved the look,style. Very well made too! I ordered the under puffy slip, only problem too large. Next time I order I will buy several sizes. But I really loved the dress


My 20 daughter bought for a wedding. True to size. Very pretty.


Dress was beautiful, I ordered a size large for my Daughter . Fit very well not to tight not to small. Nice weighted material not cheap at all . Bright red color, very well presented with protective bag. I give this seller a thumbs up! Will order again!


I love this dress!  It is so cute.  I wore it on Easter!


Very cute dress but runs large. Size S is about Size 8.


It’s a pretty dress. I’m sending it to a friend so I don’t know how it will fit.  But overall the dress is gorgeous!


Dress size ran very small and arm holes had a narrow fit. The dress was super cute though.


Love the color, not the material - it was like silky leather and it was too long for me, therefore I had to returned the item.  However I would try other items from this vendor.


Beautiful dress. 5'5" bought a large fit perfectly
