I REALLY LIKE THE DRESS,


Beautiful dress


The bust area is too high.


Loved it


I adore this dress. It fits like a dream and is so comfortable! I selected my size based on measurements and it is perfect. The fabric has a little stretch to it which is very nice. I am 5'4 and this dress hits about mid calf on me. I also purchased a petticoat for this and I absolutely love the way it fills the skirt out. The price is extremely reasonable. I may have to buy this in multiple colors. I personally feel like the length of the dress makes it a bit formal, which works well for my event. The next dress I buy may be taken up a few inches for a more casual look. But that is obviouslying a matter of taste .


Just love it!! Fits perfect! Will be getting some more!


Fits like a glove! Good quality!!


Is made of thin fabric so I will need a slip. For perfectly though.


It fitted  amazing
