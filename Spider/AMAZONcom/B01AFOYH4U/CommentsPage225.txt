I like this dress. I gave it four stars because the one I receive is not white as stated in the order - it's ivory. Fits great, but I could not wear it for the occasion for which is was purchased due to the significant difference in the color (white versus ivory).


Runs a tiny bit small.  Beautiful fabric.  Love it!


So the dress fit right but was very gapped at the neck, like right where it met my collarbones was a huge gap of fabric. Decent product


Beautiful dress. Nice satin belt added a nice touch. Sized up to large based on previous reviews. Loved, loved!


I love the fit of this dress.  It is long enough to get the style you want, but not too long to make you look short.  I paired it with a woven, pink floral belt from Guatemala for a pop of color.  Very cute style!


I got for my Little red riding hood costume, but I know I am going to wear quite  often. Loved the material, really recomend a petticoat, other than that it perfect


the dress is stretchy i wouldve bought myself a large instead of and extra large!! but the dress is nice!!


Dress is as it shows, very nice and great for the price.  I have a long torso and the waist of the dress was far too high on me:(


It is comfortable fits perfectly. It is about two inches longer then I expected but that isn't really an issue. Over all it's really great.


Large was a perfect fit for size 12-14, small waist and bigger hips. Fits like a dream and it is beautiful!
