I love this dress. It fits great, it looks really cute, and I wear it to everything.


Super cute. Looking forward to wearing it!


Loved this dress excellent quality. I bought it for my daughter it came quickly and i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fabric and how well made the dress was. Would definitely purchase again.


I love how the fabric feels on me. It is so much better than a more expensive dress I bought at the mall.


I needed to buy 2 sizes larger for the dress to fit. A perfect dress for my occasion.


Adorable cut. Very retro. I'm looking for a wide black patent leather belt. Black patent sling backs. I'm 5'7 133 lbs. sits a little high on waist.


beautiful dress, had an issue with prime shipping but called amazon and it was taken care of.  My daughter was very happy!


Pretty much what I expected. I bought the dress a size larger after reading the reviews and it fit well. The material feels good and the address is overall really nice.


A little tight in the bust but over all fit very well! I wore it to my daughter's wedding and received loads of complements! Color spot on.


This dress was gorgeous ! The style and fit was perfect for the occasion . I received many compliments on this dress. Thank you Amazon for your speedy delivery ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€!
