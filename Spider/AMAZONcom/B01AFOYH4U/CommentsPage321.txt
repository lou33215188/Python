I love this dress.


Great quality and fit as expected. I ordered a larger size as I had read they ran small and it fit great. Will order from them again.


High quality material, beautiful print!


Great fit!  Love this dress.  Not the finest material but then again it was only $20. I would definitely buy again!


Pretty much what you would expect, material is a bit scratchy but this may change after it is washed.


Perfect fit. I love it!


perfectly designed thank you


AWFUL. The dress was a dingy off white and it looked like a table cloth put on! Chest area was tight. Save your money it's not worth it.


Loved it. Was used for a costume. Will be able to reuse someday!


Fits great for what I needed it for
