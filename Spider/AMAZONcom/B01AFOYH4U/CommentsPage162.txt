My daughter truly loves this dress. She used it as a costume for Belle for church


These dresses are great.  Comfortable and wear well. I now own 3 - black, blue and red.  My size is 16 and I ordered the XXL - fits perfect.


This dress adds an amazing look to your figure no matter your shape. I am very pleased with the fit, the look and I would definitely purchase another dress in a different color.


Fits perfectly!


I washed this in the washing machine and it came out GREAT! My new favorite dress!


I do like the dress. The style is lovely. The print is beautiful. The fit for me personally, is a bit small, as I am a bit long in the waist, so the "skirt" part of the dress sits a bit higher on me than I like. My husband says it looks fabulous on me:)


Perfect fit!  goes perfectly with a Rockabilly tutu under!


I love it.  I really have no words.  Beautiful dress.  My husband love it also. Color,  fit.  Everything was as expected.


Based on the review, I bought a size up (5'8" 200 lb) and regret it.  There is a bit too much fabric and I am hoping that it will shrink in the wash.  Other than that, it isn't too large to wear and I liked it.


my daughter loves this dress.  it was shipped really fast and is a perfect fit.  Thanks so much anni coco, will buy from again
