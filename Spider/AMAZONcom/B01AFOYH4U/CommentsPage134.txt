I was shocked at how great this dress was.  I was hesitant because it was so inexpensive, but I ended up getting it and LOVE IT!  It fits perfectly, the material is nice (nothing bad but nothing spacial).  It's such a classic fit and its comfy and such a cool dress. I REALLY RECOMMEND IT!


Love the material and the dress in total... Bought a blazer and shoes to match the band.... Great combination.... :-)


Didn't fit right and zipper not well made.


i ordered extra large and it fits, I am a size 14. it looks good with or without the petticoat underneath


Great dress, especially for the price. I ordered black, because I wanted a semi-casual dress  that I could wear for funerals, or dress up. I am usually a 12 or 14 dress, 36a, l or xl shirt, and 14 pants. I ordered the xl, and it fits great. Super comfortable, and the material has a good stretch. Can be worn with or without a crinoline.


This dress is so pretty but being a size 6 with 36c bust size it was too small in the top will order bigger size!


The dress material was a little confusing. It feels like cotton sheets from a hotel room. Also it was slightly shorter than I was going for (I'm 5'8" and I got the large size). But decent dress overall.


just a cotton dress and you don't get the sash. -_-

Love this dress! Fits great!
