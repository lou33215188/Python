Beautiful Dress with an awesome price. Everyone absolutely LOVED this dress. This was a great buy and a lucky find.


Proportions were all wrong the waist was on my boobs  while everything else was fine


The dress is super cute, but was a little snug around the waist and bust.  The material stretches which helps.  All-in-all the red is vibrant and the style is super cute.


Such a great fit!  I am 38C, 5'8 and the large fits wonderfully!  I will be buying at least one more in a different color.  :)


Love it! Wore it for my secret courthouse wedding prior to our big wedding for family & friends. Simple, clean, and perfect fit.  I would suggest a slip or crinoline as the fabric is thin.


ordered a size larger than what I wear and it fitted perfectly. only reason a 4 dress looks white but is actually off white. love it, got tons of compliments


The dress is beautiful.....but it does run a little small.


This dress is remarkably well made and fits like a dream...perfect!! I'm going to order more colors!


For the price this is a good little black dress with retro flair. BE WARNED... do not put this in the dryer. It accidentally got put in with the rest of the laundry and it shrunk a fair amount. I was able to stretch it back out a bit but it isn't as great of a fit as it was before. Overall great dress... just don't be a dingus and put it in the dryer...


Really cute dress.  Can dress this up or down.  Nice quality as well.
