I like it, the color is slightly muted. I thought it would be brighter from the picture, but it fits well.


I'm very busty, so it did not fit me at all. Don't remember what size I ordered, but I ordered larger than usual, but it just didn't work for me.  Lovely if you have a perfect figure, small waist.


Good. Looking..... Quality. Is also. Good


Simple and elegant very comfortable


Just beautiful. A perfect fit. I love this because the fabric and size in the description correlated with what I received.


Fits great!! Quick service!! and so inexpensive for a such a cute dress!!! The neck rides little high on the collar but for the price this is a great steal.


I went by sizing the dress sizing chart on their description and it fits perfectly! I love it and it is just the right length! Modest but trendy!


This dress is a "classic" in every sense of the word.  I did order up a size and I am glad I did.  The bodice is truly form fitting and the flared skirt is flirty.  The material is "stretchy", and I appreciated the give.


No skirt is needed for those with a little more junk in their trunk.


Love this dress!


This dress is beautiful and fit my daughter perfectly.


It does not come with the bow and is not a friendly fabric if you have any curves.
