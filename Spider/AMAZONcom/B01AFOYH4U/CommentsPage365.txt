First, I love this dress. Why 1 star? Because it's very inconsistent and I want you to be ware. I love this dress in black (5 stars)! It's stiff and poofs out perfectly eliminating the need for a petticoat. In white, it's also cute (4 stars). Still a stiffer texture but it's flat - no poof - petticoat needed. I also ordered in the blue with flowers pattern. This is the one I absolutely hate. It's silky which is a completely different material than the other 2. Makes the fit very different than the others. No poof. Definitely need a petticoat. The silky material also makes it shiny which is terrible for an adult. And comes with a belt that's useless, I'm 32 not 12. Because of success with first two, I didn't open third until I was ready to wear and missed the return window. Open immediately even if you have others to ensure it's an apples to apples comparison.
