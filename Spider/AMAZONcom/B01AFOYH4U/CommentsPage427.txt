I read the reviews and followed the size chart for measurements and bough the underskirt recommended.  Dress fit amazing! I'm going to order some more in other colors


This dress was perfect! I loved it! Just a little snug and they don’t have the next size up. A little disappointed about that. Got it for my bridal tea party!


I bought this for a vintage tea party/graduation gathering and it worked out flawlessly. Overall it looks great, it's a beautiful dress that really accentuates your figure, and the little bow on the bodice really ties it together


This is a great lightweight summer dress. Perfect for 50's or rockabilly styles. The fabric is thin so it needs to be ironed prior to wearing. Super cute and a great value compared to similar brands. Note: I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.


Dress was gorgeous and went great with this petticoat. 


 I got tons of compliments on it!


The best dress I have ever bought online.  Husband literally said "Wow" when I tried it on: ) Fabric is firm but forgiving and flowy.  Dress is very comfortable. Versatile as a summer dress for date night or with suit jacket/cardigan for work.


The dress fit great! I tried it on and it was awesome. Then I put it in my closet because i ordered it months in advance for an event I needed it for. When I put it on or the event, the zipper split. A brand new dress and the zipper split. I've tried DIY fixes since it is too late for a return, but nothing is working. A complete waste of my money. I did not even get to wear it once. Don't buy it.


Product was torn by zipper when it arrived. Returned it


flattering design, modest cut, works with and without petticoat


cute dress, fun, inexpensive, completely versatile for many occasions and good quality.


The dress I received fit but was a bit too snug in the shoulder and bust. Other than that, this was a good buy.
