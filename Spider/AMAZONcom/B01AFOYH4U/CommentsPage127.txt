Brought this for my wife too, to our surprise it fits like it was sowed on her I mean like a glove.


LOVE this dress!  I may even order a few more in different colors.  Fit well, zipper did stick a bit at a transition in the dress.


Beautiful dress


It was a gift for my daughters banquet. The dress a huge hit. It fit perfectly and looked gorgeous on.  I would definitely buy again.


The dress looks amazing! It fits as expected. It is big on me, but it is because I am an XS, and I chose to get the S anyways because I liked the dress. I also liked the quality of the materia.


Loved it so much thinking about having my bridesmaids get it for my wedding!


This was a well made and cute dress.


It arrived right on time and it looks super cute.  I'm glad I didn't go a size smaller though cause it's kind of tight around my torso.  Eating a big meal or running a long distance could lead to some devastating results.


I absolutely love this dress and the material is also great but the best thing about this dress is the price you can't go wrong the size is true to size worth it all the way


I love this dress!  It’s classic and cute as well. Felt very comfortable all night. Best deal on a dress I like that I’ve found in quite a while. True to size.
