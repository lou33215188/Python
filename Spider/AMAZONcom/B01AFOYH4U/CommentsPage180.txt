Fit great, wrinkles easily


Itâ€™s a nice dress for the money. A little smaller than expected, but still a nice fit.


I just opened it and tried it on and I LOVE it! I thought it was going to be cheap feeling, but it's not. It's so pretty. I'm definitely going to buy another one. :)


Great style! Very summery and fits well. Dress it up to wear to a wedding or add a denim jacket and flats and wear it to the coffee shop. Length is just below the knees so better for someone my age who just doesn't look right in the short skirt any more.


The dress fits wonderfully and I love it thank you so much


Beautiful dress!  Looks better with a petticoat!


Dress is adorable. It fit perfect.


I love this dress! I ordered one size up from my size , which is a 12, I got an XL and it fit perfectly! I also bought the petticoat to go under the dress, but it was a little too puffy, lol...I guess it depends on the body type how the dress lays. I plan to order it in different colors!!!


Nice dress overall very flattering. The color was completely off, I ordered a white dress, their white is NOT white, it's eggshell. If I wanted eggshell I would have ordered that.


Very pleased with this dress.  This is my 2nd Anni Coco dress. I ordered a red Medium first time since I'm a size 6 but was a bit snugly. So for the 2nd order (this polka dot one) I ordered a Large.  Much better fit. Love to dance swing in it!  Get lots of compliment. Good quality for price! Plan to order more.
