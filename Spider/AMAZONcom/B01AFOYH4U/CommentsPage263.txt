Gorgeous dress. I love the fabric.  I loved it so much I order two more dress in different  colors and patterns.  I typically wear a medium /large on top and a large on bottom; so I order the large. It's  perfect.


I love the dress but the white isn't white it is a pale yellow. I ordered it twice to be sure. And that is the true color.


Great fit. Great color!


Beautiful fit, got lots of compliments


Beautiful dress fit as expected.


Beautifully fitted dress.


Note this is cotton-- a bit stiffer than expected, but it is flattering, and I felt lovely wearing it.


Its great. Thank you. I love it. I did receive it on the 3rd of this month. Fits like a charm.


Love this dress! So glad I bought it. Large would fit perfect in bust. Very pleased. Cannot wait to wear it.


Cheap material, poorly constructed.  Bought several other dresses similar in style that were a better buy.


Beautiful dress, fit me perfectly
