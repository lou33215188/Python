PRETTY DRESS & GREAT FIT!!


Fabric is stiff and uncomfortable and stitches were coming undone at hemline...not very good quality materials used.


Absolutely beautiful!  Bought for my teenager who needed a white dress for a school function.  She wasn't too excited until she tried it on, and now she is in love with it.  The fabric is a bit thinner than I thought it would be, but summer in NC needs lighter fabric anyway.  And it irons like a DREAM.


I am over 50, 5ft 10  I wear between a large and x-large normally.  I purchased the XL and glad I did as it fit just perfect in the bust area.


This dress is so cute, but I'm about 5'2" and 105 pounds and the size small is a little too big.  It's not huge, but big enough that I'm not going to keep it.  I feel like if I was maybe 10-20 pounds heavier it would probably fit very well.  I'm so bummed that I have to return it, but it's not the dresses fault!


Nice quality, and it looked just like the picture, but it was way too large.


Soooo cute on and is SUPER comfortable! Love this dress!!!


I wore this dress for my graduation and received a ton of complements! I definitely recommend getting a petticoat  skirt, the skirt of the dress falls a bit flat. I ordered a medium and I'm 5'8", I usually wear an 8 and it fit perfectly!


Unfortunately it didn't fit. 3 stars sizing is all over the place. I was excited to use the petticoat underneath but couldn't get the zipper up and the arm holes were small. Perhaps if i ordered XXXL it would fit but yeahh not going to try.


Love this dress so much except the zipper broke after i tried it on. I would love to keep it but have to return it.
