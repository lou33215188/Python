WONDERFUL LITTLE DRESS. It fit as expected. Quality of the dress is just as expected. It looks and feel GREAT!  GREAT BUY.


Very nice and it fits me perfectly! It's a little hard to iron but it's worth it for a dress this nice!


It was like it was described.Not bad for the price.


The skirt did not have any wave style to it.  The top part was fine but the bottom not so much.  I was hoping it would be a little close to the photo.


LOVE these.  Sewing is not great so ordered 4 and kept 2.


I love this dress! It fits great and is very cute. I initially ordered it to wear for swing dancing lessons, and ordered a petticoat to go with it; however, I plan to wear it for work also. It doesn't need the petticoat, as it flares on its own, but it does look very sweet underneath. I'm 5'7", 140 lbs, and ordered a small. It hits my knee


It was alittle longer than I expected and very thin material but otherwise it was great!


I love it.  It's a beautiful dress, really well made and a great price.  I would order from them again. I am 5'2" and the dress is tea length on me.  Only thing is hand wash only but that's okay, not everything can be wash and wear.


Great dress. I was given a small for my Christmas gift. It is a bit roomy but still cute. I am about 5’7” and weigh 114 pounds which is probably why it is a bit roomy but the length is right on.


Gorgeous dress. Very soft. Feel like such a lady when I wear it.
