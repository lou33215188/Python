Perfect fit and the color was exactly what I expected.


LOOOOOVE this dress! This was the first time I bought a dress online so I was a little concerned about the quality & size, but I was NOT disappointed at all. Great dress especially for the price. I would highly recommend wearing it with a petticoat as it adds more flair to a very classic look. I'm so excited to wear it to a holiday party.


I loooooove the dress, perfect fit (according to size guide)


I am a medium in general, and this was perfect for size.


Product looks as is as the photo (black with white roses)


Good material, looks professional, cute, or casual (as needed)


Absolutely love this dress and it fit perfectly by using the measurement chart.


I love this dress.  I'm 5-3" and it falls mid calf. Exactly right where I wanted it to.  It's a true white and looks great with heels or flat sandals.  I took the advise of others and ordered it a size larger.  It was still a little tight, but comfortable.


Beautiful dress very comfortable.  Looks amazing


I just couldn't wear it to the event I had anticipated; it was poor quality fabric and just was not flattering! I am 5'2, 110 pounds and ordered the xs. Returned it!


Great Dress! I bought the royal blue and it was beyond what I was expecting. I'm 5'2 and 135lbs and the medium was a great fit. Looks classy and is not made of cheap material.


This dress looks awesome,is very comfortable and fit true to size. I got so many compliments when I wore it on St Patrick's Day!


I can't believe this actually fit me perfect! It is exactly how it looks in the picture.  The white material is a little see through but not too much. I really love it and will buy more in different colors. Very flattering and pretty.
