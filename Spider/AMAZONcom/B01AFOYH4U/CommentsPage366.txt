Poor quality material, but it is still a cute dress. I'm not sure what the material is, but it kinda feels like a paper bag and wrinkles really easily. Nonetheless, at the price and for the style, I will keep it. It does hold shape really well, so I found I didn't need a petticoat. I think after some washes, it will soften up. I would be careful not to iron this dress with high heat or put it in your dryer as I imagine it would shrink right up. I didn't notice washing instructions inside the dress or on any tag, but that's fine.
