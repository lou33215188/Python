I bought this for my bridal shower. Tried it on and loved it. Put it on for my shower went to zip it then bottom of the zipper split then got stuck. Had to drive to my shower with my dress me stuck in a unzipped dress. Loaded the other dresses I had at home in a basket. I had to be cut out of the dress ended up wearing a blue dress not the white i had pictured I would wear. A very stressful start to my shower


nice dress, fits perfectly.
