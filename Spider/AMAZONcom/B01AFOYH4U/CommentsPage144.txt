Added the petticoat under it and it looked great


This dress was excellent! It was delievered on time, the color is so vibrant and pretty. Loved, loved, loved it!!! My only issue was that it needed to be pressed, ironing it won't get out those wrinkles!


Just needed a black dress for work. I prefer 50s/60s style dresses. This one was perfect. The material makes lint and pet hair stick to it easily. But I just use a lint roller before I leave the house.


This dress was so ridiculous! They inserted some kind of breast pads that showed through the dress. It was sown as if it was for someone with an extremely small upper body and average lower body. Very odd. Unhappy with this dress that can't even be worn. The dress in no way looked anything like the photo.


Fits perfect!


The material is thin and cheap feeling, a little stiff.  It looks cute though


Very lovely dress. I would buy another


I purchased this for my 18 year old daughter as a gift and she absolutely loved it. It is much better quality than I anticipated and even the packaging was beautiful. The sash was included and the fit was perfect.


I really wanted to like this dress, however, it was too large (even though I ordered a small) and simply fit weird. There is no definition and it looked likeep I was wearing a large blue sack that went down to myour shins. In addition, the fabric was coarse and stiff. This was not the dress for me.


Absolutely beautiful! I'm almost 5'8" around 170lbs and ordered the XL which fit perfectly! I recommend getting a petticoat otherwise it's really missing something. I will say it wrinkles easily though so be mindful when wearing!
