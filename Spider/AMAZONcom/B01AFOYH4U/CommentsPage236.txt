Love LOVE LOVE this dress !!!!! It fit me very well and I received a lot of compliments after wearing !!! CLASSIC , ELEGANT and GRACEFUL outfit design !!!


I got so many compliments on this dress. I would highly recommend it.


Wonderful material.  Fits as expected.  Great dress.


I loved the look of this. The seems are good and the material isn't too heavy weight.It does run small so I had to return mine :(


I bought this dress for my daughter and it fit perfect. She's 5'3", 144 lbs and the medium was just right.


Didn't think I would fit into this at 5'2" and 170lbs but it fit like a glove! Very big on the bottom and made me feel like a princess. Would buy another dress like this! ğŸ˜Š


I absolutely love my dress! I did do review research and ordered 1 size bigger and it is perfect! I will be a return customer!!!


Order a size up from what I would normally wear. It fits perfectly!!! Very happy! It will need to be ironed. It's is definitely good quality for the price!


I didn't even try this dress on.  I need a white dress for an event, and this dress isn't really white, it's off-white which is not permitted for the event.
