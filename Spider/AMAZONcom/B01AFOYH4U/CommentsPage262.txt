Looks cheap. I asked for return, and when wanted to do the return, couldn't find shipping label.


Great for price


I did not like this dress. It fit like it was a moomoo.


Couldn't get it on, it was so small in the bust


Fits beautifully, and incredibly flattering!  Especially with a petticoat underneath.  Love this dress!


Beautfiul dress, but I feel like it would look better on someone skinnier or taller. I also thought that fabric would be more stiff.


Wow... The fit is great. Very stylish comfy and people stop to compliment you. For this price its un beatable product.


Didnt expect that the fabric will be stretch. It has some unpolished lines of the  sewing but once ironed or dry cleaned it gives and excellent finished.


Beautiful DressğŸ˜Š!!!


Thank you so much
