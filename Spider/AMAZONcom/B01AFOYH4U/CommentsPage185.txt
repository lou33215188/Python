I was worried about the fit because I wear a XS(0-2). This fit great. Not to tight or too loose. I thought for the price the quality was good. I will be buying more.


I have this dress in 2 colors. Nice fit and nice style. My only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily. Just sitting in it will cause major wrinkles. Other than that I love it.


The dress is great! I want to order so many more because of its high quality. I would recommend buying one. Also there is stretch which was great. I wish the dress had pockets. Otherwise canâ€™t complain.


I ordered this dress by the measurements in the size chart but it came too small. It is a very beautiful dress but id didn't fit, and didn't feel to go to the trouble of sending t back so i sold it to my sister who is smaller than i am. Disappointed.....


Was wayyyyyy to long I'm 5' feet


This is the third dress of this design that I have ordered & am enjoying.  The only thing that has not been quite consistent is the length of the dress.  It has very slightly.  I love the design & material used.  They wash nicely.  Thank you!


I am 5ft4 and about 130lbs. This dress fit me perfectly.


I bought this for my daughter for a dance costume. It fit exactly as we thought it would. It has the perfect amount of stretch to be comfortable and move with her. I would definitely order this dress again.


I LOVE this dress. I am 5'3 and 127 pounds, and I got a size small. This dress fits PERFECTLY. I'm wearing it my bridal shower and it is perfect! I do need to wear a slip underneath it, but it is better than any white dress I've tried on. 100% recommend.


I love this dress! I followed the measurements in the description and ordered the M. I am 5'3, 118 lbs and it fit perfectly. The fabric is thick, and has a very niche shine to it.  I would buy again in other colors. I would buy it again in Black, just to have a spare one for when this one has worn out! I like it that much!
