I loved the stretch of the material. It fit well while enhancing my figure and hiding imperfections.


The dress is beautiful well made and fits as expected the only thing was that it came broken real bummer besides that disappointment everything else was fine


Don't waste your time reading other reviews; just buy this beautiful dress.  I am 5.11 and dress size 8; it fits perfectly.

It was a little longer than we thought. She usual wears a small glad I got a medium. Fits perfect


LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this dress! I like the dress without the tutu petticoat as well as with the extra fluff of the tutu petticoat skirt. The dress itself has a good feel but it does wrinkle very easy. I will be purchasing more of these dresses for the price.


Nice dress however company would not allow the return for a larger size, 2 days late on return date


Absolutely in LOVE. Fits perfectly, very flattering. I will be purchasing in other styles and colors in the near future. So many relatives loved it on New Year's Eve that they are now looking to purchase. I dressed it up with red shawl and shoes, but can dress it so many ways depending on the event. So grateful I came across this dress!


We did go safe and got a size bigger but it fit perfect and everyone complemented it


I bought this dress for my daughter.  This feels like a high-quality dress made with durable material.  It fits her really well and looks fantastic!  She is ecstatic with this dress!
