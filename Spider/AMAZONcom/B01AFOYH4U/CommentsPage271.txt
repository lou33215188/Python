Great dress for the price! Use the size chart to help select the correct size. Worked well for me. Fabric is heavy and a nice quality. Adding a belt to dress it up a bit for a wedding. Color is vibrant.


Excellent! I will definitely buy again (^_-)


Feels short waisted bit fits great and is a staple to any wardrobe


Great style but tight around the shoulders.


This is my second dress and I love the fit and style. Very comfortable.


The fit is good .But quality  is  very cheap ......One time use only .


Fit my wife very well. She looks great. Fast delivery too!!


nice dress, but kinda small


Awesome!!! Soft fabric and flattering too!


This dress is lovely, I wear mine all the time. Make sure you follow the washing directions carefully though, the material is a bit delicate.
