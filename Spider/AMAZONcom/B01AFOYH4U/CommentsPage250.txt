Loved it


Very cute. Fits like a glove.


Made for a very mis-shapened person.  The top was very small and the bottom was extremely wide.


Such a beautiful dress! I bought this dress for my daughter to wear for her Christmas concert.  She received many compliments!


Loved the color and the material


Wore this to a hot Texas outdoor wedding. Very flattering and fun to dance in. Did buy a belt to cover the waist seam.


Absolutely love this dress!! The belts a bit annoying cause it doesn't have loops so I just pinned it. Still totally love it!!!


I have never written a product review before but I LOVE this dress so had to write one.  It fits perfectly and looks great!  I am going to buy another color.


I love the material and it was gorgeous, I bought it for my daughter for xmas and I know she will love it. She loves to dress like Audrey H.
