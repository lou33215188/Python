Love this dress!! Great quality I am very pleased!!


Beautiful fit!  I am a size 12, 134 lbs, 4'10".  Looks great on me, got lots of compliments.


Fit of dress was as expected; laid beautifully even without the underskirt. However, not true white...more beige in color.


Beautiful!


Fabric is somewhat sheer. I needed a full slip underneath. Styling is great!


Doesnâ€™t include belt shown , no belt at all


The waist was too high for my figure.


This dress fits perfect. I love it


The dress was off white and I wanted white...Nothing like the dress in the picture.


love the dress fits awesome....great material....only concern is zipper is so small not sure it will last!!!
