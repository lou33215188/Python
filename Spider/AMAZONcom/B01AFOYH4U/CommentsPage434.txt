Beautiful dress, just need a bigger size.


I really like this dress. It has a bit of stretch which is nice. For the most part it fit as expected, however I'm pretty broad in the the shoulders and the arm opening is a bit snug.


Fit as expected, very cute pattern and with a flattering cut. Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.


I needed a white dress for an all white event. This was advertised as white but it came in an off white/ivory color.


I love this dress! I can't wait to wear it.


Beautiful dress. Very well made. Nice fit. Wonderful price.
