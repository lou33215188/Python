Love the color


The zipper failed on the first wearing.


I LOVED THIS DRESS! I TOOK OFF MY HEELS IN THE PICTURE AS IT WAS A LONG DAY LOL, BUT BE SURE TO PURCHASE A PETTICOAT TO PUT IT UNDERNEATH! :)


The dress was absolutely stunning!  I received so many compliments.  I wore a petticoat under dress for full affect.


I bought it for a granddaughter and we are going to have to have it hemmed as it is too long for her taste.


This item was intended as a gift.  However, the item was just a little bit too tight (not off-size enough to return) and the zipper was binding at the half-way point.  It is a beautiful dress that will definitely get somebody noticed.


I normally wear an 18 in women's plus sizes, I'm also big busted (DD). This dress fit like it was tailored for my body. Absolutely love it. Great quality!


I often times don't have the time to leave product review. But I have to say , this dress is fantastic. Love it. I received great compliments.


This is the best dress, I bought it for a funeral, and this is going to sound strange, but I got so many compliments on it. I am definitely going to buy other colors. It fits really well, very true to size and is made really well.


So great for vintage a line. Wear a petticoat for more ooomph.
