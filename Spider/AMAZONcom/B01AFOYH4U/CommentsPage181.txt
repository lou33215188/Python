I'm a size 10 with 34D cup size. There wasn't sufficient allowance for the bust area, causing the waistline to hit right below my breast. It wasn't flattering so I won't be using it. Too bad because I really loved the dress.


Very cute!


This dress is awesome for the price! Super cute and flattering!!


It fits great, is classy looking and can be dressed down for the office or up for a night out.


I wore this for my vow renewal to celebrate our 20th anniversary.  It was perfect for our beach ceremony.


Did not likemthe material,  I returned it,  I hope I USED THE RIGHT LABEL


What we expected


Very pretty and just as described, the length is great! And size spot on


Fit perfectly and covered all of my flaws.  This dress is complementary to any size, especially those of of with a little more hips than desired.


I love this dress. I bought in two colours and will buy other colours as I love how it feels on.
