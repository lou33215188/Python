Love the dress. We'll made and the material is perfectly weighted for this style. I will be ordering more!


Had an odor that was hard to get out, zipper was tough to zip in spots.


excellent!


Arrived quick.  Very nice dress. I will update after I wear it to the dinner at the National Infantry Museum in December.


I LOVE this dress! Its fits perfect! Im 5'10 and about 150lbs! Its shapes me perfectly and is plenty long enough!


Beautiful Dress!!!


I always check the size chart to get an idea of the fit. I normally wear a size 10, but ordered a large and I am happy with the fit. The perfect dress for any occasion. Add a fancy belt and you are good to go.


I would have given 5 stars however,  I needed a dress for an all WHITE party and when the dress arrived, it was a cream color and the zipper catches in the seam. Great dress for the money, just not if you want a WHITE  dress!


I totally love it! I was a little nervous about how it would fit, but when arrived and put it on, was exactly what I was expecting.


The material is a little thicker and has a stretch to it. I'm larger in the chest and hips and this dress is extremely flattering.
