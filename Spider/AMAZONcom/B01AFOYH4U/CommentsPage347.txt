Beautiful dress made of quality materials.


Lovely dress.


I LOVE this dress. Bought it in two patterns and they are both beautiful. Just wore it to my daughter's college graduation and received many compliments from both students and parents. The fabric stretches just a bit, and the size med. fits my 5' 10", 148 lb. frame.


This dress hides a multitude of weight flaws (my waste is short and thick), and still looks flatttering. Makes me look as if I have an hourglass figure!


Just be careful if it's windy since the skirt can tend to blow out, ala Marilyn Monroe.


This is a fun, pretty, very reasonably priced summer dress.


This was not true to the size.  The material was nice but the top of the dress is very tight for my bust even though I used te size chart.


Thanks


Didn't like the material of this dress. Fabric is to stiff and it picks up all the lint of other fabrics.


It's so beautiful! I am large chested and was nervous about the fit on top but it fits so nicely everywhere!


Love it


I 5'3" and and half and with 4.5 inch heels it came right pass my knee. This dress is very light and comfortable


Great style and perfect fit. Very classy and a wonderfu dress.
