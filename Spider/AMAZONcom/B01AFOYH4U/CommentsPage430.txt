This dress fits great. I am 5'7" and 165 pounds and the size Large fits very well. The fabric is a good quality especially for the price.


Bought this dress for my granddaughter who is  going to a friend's wedding, dress is very very nice, and size ordered  fit her perfect , and sent out as promised , we are very happy with the order .


Fits great can't wait to wear it for a date night out.


It's so beautiful! Fits as expected and it made me feel so elegant!


this dress is good


This dress is super fun. I definitely recommend getting the petticoat to wear underneath so it's extra flouncy. The only thing I did not like was the sash. I could not tie a decent bow with it and had to buy a different one to wear.


Loved this dress! Good fabric and looked great on. Material doesn't stretch so make sure you order your size. Added a tutu slip underneath to give it that extra tough.


The material was very crispy, stiff and thin, like a child's costume. I'm 5'4", the length was almost to my ankles. May have been fine if I'd taken the time to steam out all the wrinkles, but did not feel it was worth it.


This is a gorgeous dress. It fits perfectly. The length is perfect for dressy or casual outings. The fabric is super comfortable.


Really pretty! Fits GREAT and looks amazing! Looks like it will wash well also but haven't tried yet.
