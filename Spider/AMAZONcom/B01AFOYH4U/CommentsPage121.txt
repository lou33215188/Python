Vibrant color, beautiful fit. Be sure to wash it with a color catcher cloth.


This is a great dress.  The material is light weight cotton and stretchy.


It was way to tight. The dress is lovely, not for the full figure gal.


I absolutely loved how this dress looked and fit on me. Gave me the back in the day "baby doll" look i was going for. Got so many compliments on it. I will be purchasing other patterns.


My girlfriend looks amazing in it


The dress comes really wrinkled but it was nothing an iron couldn't fix. Dress fit amazing. Will definitely order more.


The fit of the dress is very odd. It bunches up around the neck line.  My daughter tried it in as well and it did the same to her.  I am returning it.


Beautiful dress! It fits perfectly and is exactly what I have been looking for. I haven't seen anything like it in anywhere else and am very happy to have found it on Amazon. It couldn't have been a better buy or shopping experience.


This dress is exactly what I expected, it was true to the size, color and material described, I wear a size 18 so I purchased the 2 X and it fit perfectly.


really nice but too small..... I donated to charity
