Loved it


I love it,  it is actual size and the material looks good material but it's a little different form the picture the riboon from the dress is black and not gray but I don't mind


Dress a little small but was afraid of that, beautiful thick fabric. Packaged nicely.


Love this dress, I wear it to all my formal events.  It's a little longer that I expected but it works out. Helps alot if you put a petti coat under it to puff it up a little and make it look a tad more fun.


The dress is very stretchy and large, and the zipper is very difficult to get up and down. It's pretty, but not very well made.


I used this dress as part of a costume for Belle from Beauty and the Beast. I absolutely LOVED the way it looked. It is my favorite dress to own right now!!


Nice regular dress which fits well. would recommend


This dress is beautiful!! The fit is perfect.


Too large for measurements and see-through


I love this dress. Everything about it is feminine: soft, light weight, elegant, and simply beautiful.
