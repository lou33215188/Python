This dress is absolutely beautiful.  Exceeded expectations.  Great quality and fit true to size!


I loved this dress!!! It fit so well and I got so many compliments!!!


I ordered one size larger than I wear and it was still a little snug.


Once washed the length did shrink a bit, so when worn with the petticoat underneath, the tulle showed.


I like the dress the zipper is a little hard to deal with.


Nice dress, but it does run very small.


Amazing quality and the fit is perfect!


Super cute dress. All you need is a petticoat to make it even better. Came in a zippered bag. Very thick cloth. Better than expected.


Loved the dress and quality. Had to return it because it was just too big


Tell  people  you need tool
