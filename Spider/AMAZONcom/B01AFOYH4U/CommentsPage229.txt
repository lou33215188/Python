Soft and classy. Very flattering.


It was perfect! I wore it for my bridal shower. I got so many compliments! I am 5'0 tall and wear a size 4 or 6, I ordered a small and it fit perfect! I'm in love with this dress and can't wait get other colors!


Aside from the zipper falling apart while changing for an event (which my mother repaired), it's a lovely dress, fits well and flows so pretty.


Dress is very nice and fabric quality is great. the way it flows is very lovely. Im very pleased with this purchase ...Cant wait to wear this weekend.


Looks good, just a bit big in the waist


Delivered with a huge rip in the back of the dress. Never tried it on.


This is a SM. I think I could use an XS but it doesn't come in XS. I will be getting it hemmed, as it's a little long for my liking.


Bought this for my daughter, it is a classic dress. So flattering on and elegantly made. She looks like Audrey Hepburn!!


the cloth isn't as soft as you think it would be but most of all every thing else was perfect


Bought this for a wedding and it was great! Fit as expected and received a bunch of compliments on it!
