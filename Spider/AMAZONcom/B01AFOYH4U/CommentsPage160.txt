I absolutely love this dress! I've already recommended it to some of my friends and family. The fabric is fantastic, the length (with a petticoat) is perfect, and the Fit of it in general is perfect!


Dress fit perfectly. I bought a petticoat and it made the perfect, affordable dress for a wedding.


Love the red sash that came at it! Wasn't expecting >classy and elegant.


True to size. It’s a little stiff and super wide but it’s made for the tutu underneath. Without it kind of looks weird....but it’s true to the picture!!


Pretty, but feels like a shower curtain. I bought more than 1 in different colors, but I decided to send the others back.


Very pretty can wear with or without the full slip.So its like havi ng 2 dresses


Nicely shaped, good for the price.


I bought this dress for my 17 years old who weighs 115 pounds and it fits perfectly  she is 5 ft tall.she loves it. This is her third dress  from Anni Coco and they all fits her perfectly.


This dress is gorgeous, However, received this brand new item in the mail with a large hole in the back of the dress.


Very beautiful and love the dress.
