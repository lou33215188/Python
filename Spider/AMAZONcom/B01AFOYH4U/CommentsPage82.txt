I absolutely love the dress. It is best to know your measurements when buying so that you can order the size correctly. The dress is exactly what is pictured and good quality.


I'm 5'5" and 170 lbs with a 36G bust. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly! I did not wear it with an underskirt but I don't feel I needed it. I was twirly and comfortable. It wasn't heavy so I could breathe and didn't get too hot. L I felt stylish and sleek and I was held in in all the proper places AND it covered up my belly so I could eat what I wanted! I got so many compliments! 10/10 would recommend to someone!


I love this dress. That being said I did my homework before I bought the dress.  They run a little small so I would buy one size up from your measurement.  They do come in a small package so be prepared to iron or take it someplace to be pressed. The color was perfect. There are no tags in the dress except for the size so washing instructions are not available. All told for the money you can't beat it.


Absolutely beautiful, however I am very large on top and just too tight otherwise I love it.


Ladies! what a great find!! I am a size 14 in most stores, 5'11" tall, ordered the XXL and it fits me beautifully!!! i could be happier with the fabric and cut. the fabric is a medium thick ness and has some stretch in it, really forgiving and fitting :) i am so glad i got this dress!


This dress was of better quality than I expected - the cut is perfect and while it was slightly large, it still fit comfortably and looked lovely.


I wore this to an adult tea/paint party. It was so comfortable and the material was excellent.


Beautiful and well made dress, true to size


Very happy with my purchase


This dress is so beautiful... it is simply made and looks like a million bucks on.


I returned it, the waist band was really high. This dress is good for small women. But the fabric .... meh.
