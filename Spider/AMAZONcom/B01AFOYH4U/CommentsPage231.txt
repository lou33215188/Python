I love this dress but runs small. Would loved to have had it just a tad bigger.


The size was exactly what I hoped and for the price it’s an amazing dress! I wasn’t sure about this when I ordered but am very happy with the result.


Love this beautiful dress. TTS & astonishing look. My 2nd time ordering but just a different color


Another beautiful dress that is so classic and everyone loved it. Nice cotton dress.


Love it!


I love my dress and can't wait to wear it. The perfect dress for a wedding shower I'm attending! Will definitely be buying another!


I love the dress, it fits perfectly. The color is as the picture and the quality looks great. I am using it for my company's holiday party cannot wait.


Love it! Fits great! Classy, modest dress.  Hits just below knee and I'm 5ft 3. Also a 38ddd and had no issues with fit just was a little snug but the dress has some stretch. Only thing is the zipper is of lower quality. Other than that A++


Dress is beautiful.  Fit my daughter perfectly.  Wonderful quality for the price.  Also came packaged nicely to protect it during shipping.


The small fits my size 4, 13 year old girl pretty well, and looks divine
