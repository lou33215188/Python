The dress I received was not at all like the picture. The dress I received was lace and had a small bow in the front.


Super cute. I thought the size would run small so ordered a bigger size and it worked out. I've gotten a lot of compliments on this dress. :)


This dress is absolutly beautiful and fits like a glove. I brought this dress for a Jr. Bridesmaid and she loves it.


I love this dress


The only thing it was a litle big cuz im very tiny im size 2


butbi send it to the tailor and theres is the result absolutely beautiful


It's a beautiful dress.  I'll make it work. It's a little to big.  I'll have it taken in.


A great dress for price, but zipper gets stuck slightly at stitching about mid way up. Fits as expected and does look great.


I am 5’3” , 157 lbs with 36 bust. I bought a large size dress and it fits perfect.


It was a beautiful, beautiful dress and would have fit absolutely perfectly but as soon as I opened it and looked down, the zipper was broken halfway off... Megan bummer.


Very nice dress


It was white but not pleated. It was not what was I was expecting. It was all wrinkled and cheap
