Nice dress just a little big in waist and hip area have to alter to fit right.  Overall nice product.


Love the dress. I got it for a 50s party, but can it’s perfect for wearing anytime.  Great fit!


It is so cute! You really can’t beat this dress for the price paid! I ordered a large and it fits perfect. I’m curvy but smaller on top and was a little concerned it wouldn’t zip but it was fine.


A little bigger than expected. I would have gone with my normal size next time. But very cute and vintage looking!


This dress is beautiful, I read the reviews before purchasing and I was not disappointed when my dress arrived. Very good quality and fit, will be buying more colors.


Awesome reminds me of Aubrey Hepburn

Fits as it should-true to size


Fast shipping, daughter loves the dress. Interesting fabric.


I absolutely loved it
