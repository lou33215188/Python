A slightly too fitted dress but was worth what I paid for it.


I absolutely love this dress! I can wear it for several different occasions. I have gotten several compliments about how nice it is. It's very comfortable too.


Perfect to dress up or dress down! It makes me feel so feminine! Love the fabric, too.  Very well-made. I can't believe the quality for this price.


Bought for my daughter.  She looks great.  Fits very well.  She is a small or medium, but medium worked really well.


Bought this for my daughter who is 5"6 and wears a large.  Fit is right on.  I recommend buying a red or black petticoat to wear with this dress to get the skirt part to flare out like in picture.  Also be sure to use the Anni Coco sizing chart. We simply love the look of this dress!


I wore this to my bridal shower and it fit perfectly. While I did also purchase a petticoat it had a nice flow without it as well. The color is amazing and I want to buy additional dresses in different colors because I loved it so much!


Beautiful dress,  product is always as described and size chart it right on point. Have purchased a couple other dresses from seller and have been very pleased with each one as they are great quality at a reasonable price. They fit my style of fashion perfectly. Always delivered right on time.


Cute but way too much fabric from the waist down


This dress is beautiful. The fabric was much thicker/sturdier than I expected. Other reviews recommended getting a size larger, which I did. I typically am somewhere between a medium and a large and ordered an extra large, which fits perfectly. The skirt lays flatter than I would like on its own, so I plan to wear it with a petticoat.


Really cute and comfy. Would totally wear with the right accessories to a work event or something.
