I love this dress!! I wore this to a wedding and used a petticoat underneath. I got tons of compliments. I usually wear size 12 and based on the reviews I ordered a Large which was a perfect fit. I plan to order another one.


Product packaged very well. The dress was wrinkled but that is understandable


I love the style of the dress but I didn't know it do not come with a petty coat to go underneath.  Also,the medium fit like a small. So order a size up from what you normally wear.


Fits perfectly.


I never can buy online but was desperate!


I could afford it!


It fit!


It is Well made!


It is a beautiful color!


It arrived quickly!


Very cute on, Great fit, Nice dress, material a little difficult to iron...


Disappointed that the 2x fits small. I cannot zip my dress, I normally wear XL or 1XL.


This dress is probably the best fitting dress I have ever purchased. It looks amazing. Other reviewers say it runs a little small, but I am pear shaped so it works out perfectly for me. This dress is so cute I will probably buy multiple in different colors.


Gorgeous dress and high quality fabric- very impressive! I did buy a pettiskirt to go under it but it could easily be worn without. I am very impressed with the quality of dress for such an amazing price!


I tried it on as soon as it came. I was so excited because it fit so perfectly. I will order the crinnolin to go under it by it looks great without it.
