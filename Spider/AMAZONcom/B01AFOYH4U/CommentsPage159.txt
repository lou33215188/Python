very cute dress. a little longer on me because im short but cute. size was perfect


was cautions about it being too small so i decieded to go big, well I guess it was too big.  My fault, dress was fine.


Love it. Fits me so well. Its the exact length I want, the color is vibrant and can be worn with or without a petticoat depending on the look you're going for.


Lovely dress! Fit perfectly and was knee length (I'm tall so that was nice). I wore it to a wedding and received a lot of compliments. Looks very classy and was easy to wash and dry. I just put it in a delicates bag and it went in a regular load of darks and hung it to dry. Shook it out and it didn't have wrinkles either. I'll probably get another in a different color!


Was what we were looking for, for a Alice costume.


It was too small for my granddaughter but my daughter could wear it.  So I had to order another size 2x.  Will see it if when it arrives.


Love this dress! Perfect for summer or a casual get together! Well made, good quality material!


Great dress, Great Communication


Wrinkles extremely easily.


Very soft fabric, fits well. Many compliments.
