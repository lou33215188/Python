I just used twice because the cloth get wrinkles and it is so annoying iron it so it is not comfortable


Perfect fit. for the price I couldn't be happier.


The dress was nice for the price, I had to return because it is actually "off white" not white.


The dress fit just right no compliance  thank you very much.


The dress is made small. I re-ordered the next size up and it fit better. Loved the dress overall.


i returned it.


Size said 12-14. I wear a 12 and it fit more like an 8-10. Had to return


Just what we needed.


Cheap. Cheap. Cheap


It's a nice dress
