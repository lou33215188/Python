Love it..


Fits great


I could not be more thrilled with this dress. I ordered the black with white floral print and red silk belt for my 17 year old daughter and immediately wanted one for myself. Fits somewhat small-my daughter and I wear a size 6 and 8 respectively, ordered a medium and it fits both of us well. I'm pleased with the fabric quality. Zipper and seams are well crafted. Hits just below the knee, great length if you want to add a crinoline underneath (we did and would recommend it). I ordered it for myself in plain black for a formal event and will likely order another color soon. Highly recommended, fabulous quality for the price!


Fit amazing, good quality, extremely satisfied.


Beautiful color and craftsmanship. Fits nicely, modest, and very comfortable.
