A beautiful dress!! Order 1 size larger to ensure proper fit


I bought this summer dress for my daughter. She is size 2. It fits wonderful We love the length. Waiting for more colors. Is hard to find a dress that is not polyester but cotton.


Love this dress!  It fits perfectly and I get lots of compliments on it.  I also bought a petticoat to wear underneath for swing dancing nights.


Love this dress. Great quality. Very full skirt and was great with a petticoat underneath.


I LOVED the blue color. It is rich and the material is amazing. Arrived well packaged, clean and all intact. Had to return it BC it did not fit as I wanted it too. WISH it would have. Had no issues returning it.


I now have three of these in different designs and they are great! They are flattering and modest. I get so many compliments!


Love it!  This dress fit me great.  I'm 5'4 and weigh 170.  However I'm bottom heavy and this dress fit me awesome!  I ordered a size Medium and wore it with a petticoat.  Will definitely buy from this seller again.


This dress is super cute and fits really nicely. Has a little stretch to the fabric but isn’t a flimsy feeling cloth. I was able to wear a grey bra under it and it didn’t show through at all.


I love this dress - very comfortable and fits snug! Lots of compliments on this dress.


This is one of the nicest black dresses I've ever owned hands down. I felt so pretty the minute I put it on. I was worried the fabric would be thin and cheap but it is a nice quality fabric. I can't wait to buy this in other colors!
