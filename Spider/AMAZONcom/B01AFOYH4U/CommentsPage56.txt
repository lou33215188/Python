I ordered a Medium and it's very snug in the bust and waist, almost skin tight. The length of the dress fall around my mid calves.. So it is long! The fabric is heavy, similar to a waterproof fabric raincoat. I do not like the feel of it. Maybe washing it will get rid of that waxy feel. Its jet black and I love that.


I'm 5'2 and 119 lbs.  I followed the sizing guideline by the seller and it's slightly loose.  I bought a Medium because the S is one inch smaller than my waist.  I kind of wish I got the S instead because the fabric comes with a stretch.  I've decided not to return because the looseness gives me more fabric and more flow to the dress.  I took off a star because the dress came very wrinkly.  But I guess that can't be helped because of shipping.  But overall, a very beautiful classic and elegant dress.


This is my new favorite dress. If I could give it more stars I would! I got so many compliments wearing it and I felt amazing! I highly recommend getting a petticoat with it as it poofs it a little but if you donâ€™t it will still look super cute!


The dress fits like I thought it would, and is beautiful, but it is a completely different color. The picture makes it look super bright which is what I need for a wedding I'm in. In actuality, it's a very light sky blue.


This was huge !!! Which was way sad cause I really liked the cut of the dress, and the material was nice. I had to return it cause I probably could have used it as a tent.


This dress is so beautiful


My fiancÃ© said I had the Michelle Obama look!


I'm going to order more ! I wore this for my black and pearls bridal luncheon. Size is as expected. I'm 5'8. I ordered a large


This dress is a steal! The dress is made of nice, comfortable material and seems to be well made. It arrived on time and was nicely packaged. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable dressy yet casual dress that has the classic look that is appropriate for multiple occasions.


I had to order in a size L because my body type is two different sizes so the upper part is a little big for me, but not too big as to where I can't work with it. The quality of the fabric is good, the flow of the dress is wonderful. I love my little black dress. Thinking of ordering one in another color.


I love the way that the dress looks, except that they don't even try to match the print. This wouldn't be a big deal, except that there are panels on the chest. It makes it incredibly obvious that the polka dots don't line up.


I honestly love the dress! It is loose on the top (Iâ€™m flat chested so thatâ€™s probably a given). Helpful tip: Wear a petticoat under to make it poofy! Iâ€™ve actually never worn a dress like this so Iâ€™m very pleased. Iâ€™m 5ft, 109 pounds (I donâ€™t mean to sound conceited but Iâ€™m pretty skinny) and I ordered a Small since the dress I wanted was unavailable for XS. The dress is kind of wrinkled but I guess itâ€™s okay since it was mailed ğŸ¤·ğŸ�»â€�â™€ï¸�
