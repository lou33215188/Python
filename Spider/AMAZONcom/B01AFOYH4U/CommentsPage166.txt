Didn't love the material.


beautiful, just what I wanted, It's hard to find dresses that come a little below the knee.


i dont normally leave reviews but i just had too on this dress. This dress is just gorgeous and for this price i would recommend it over and over again. I will now order all colors.


Just something to note if you normally wears large then order extra large,


I've been buying a lot of these vintage dress imports, and I'm really surprised by the quality. I'm super picky, and I am always willing to pay more for quality, so it's great to get quality without having to pay a lot for it. My teen daughter looks like Grace Kelly in this dress. Material is heavyweight and stretchy, so it hangs beautifully, isn't clingy, is comfy and doesn't require a slip. Perfect for summer in humid and hot Chicago, and would work for work to date wear. Also, a lot of these dresses are marked dry clean only but I haven't had any problem with washing them on the gentle cycle in a top loader and then drying them most of the way on the gentle cycle, followed by hanging to dry fully.


Perfect for my courthouse wedding. Arrived on time and fits as expected. I ordered a petticoat to wear underneath and it gave it the perfect swing and flare. Not too much but just enough. Perfect with or without a belt. The only thing is that it's not bright white in color. It's more like an eggshell white. It has a yellowish tone when you look at it in the light.


Love this dress!


This dress is what I was expecting. Comfortable and classy. I love it!


Not pure white as expected but still a gorgeous dress...


I love this dress, it was perfect and my favorite color is yellow. However I had to return because it was too small and they didn't have the extra large. Therefore I had to return to my dismay


Bautiful, comfortable, and fit perfectly. Was a little wrinkles but honestly I was impressed at how nice it was even coming out of the package.
