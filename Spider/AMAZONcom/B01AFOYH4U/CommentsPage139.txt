I liked it but my wife did not so back it went.


I recommend this dress! It fit great, was manufactured well, and I got 3 compliments on it within one day. It isn't lined, so I wore a slip underneath it.


Very will made but the size chart is off. The dress was way too big and I didn't have time to get it taken in so I had to return it.  ;(


Perfect. Wonderful. Fun to wear. Fits as expected - even for me (short, 5'3" with long legs). I should have bought several.


got so many compliments....semi stretch! love it


Daughter loved this dress. the only negative was it was a little long for her but she is shorter. But she absolutely loved it.


I love this dress and the way it fits. I ordered it in black and wore it to an interview, (got hired too) yet I have a love hate relationship with the fabric. It's very good quality, but it's a lint trap. You'd be better off just carrying a little lint roller in your purse... which is what I did.


Nice dress....way heavier than what I was expecting....quite long for my 4ft 11" frame.... i got me a M and it was true to size.


Was way longer than shown in the picture


True to size. These dresses are absolutely beautiful! I bought 5 of them!
