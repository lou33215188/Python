It fits amazing! I ordered a large and it's a little snug but it's exactly how I wanted it. The only thing that bothers me is how close and tight it is under the armpit but other then that I love it!!


I love the dress but I should have purchased in a larger size and would have but did not come in a large size.


Super cute! I'm 5'7 and a bigger woman at 240lbs. The XXL fits great!!!!


Love the fit and the fabric. It is very slightly high waisted which I love!


The top was a bit small for my chest but the waist was a perfect fit. Overall I love the dress. I was extremely satisfied on the quality


My autistic daughter loved the dress


love love not a pure white though


Amazing dress and price! Everything I had hoped it would be


Will buy in every color. Wear with petticoat.


Ordered for my daughter, she is somewhat concerned with the way the fabric feels. We have to have it taken in because a size 2 is just not small enough.
