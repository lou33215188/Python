I love this! I bought it for My 14 year old for a dance looks great, it moves well. My daughter loves it. Thank you ğŸŒ¸


Wore it to my anniversary dinner. The boyfriend loved it. The quality is good and the fit is great. I got the medium. I'm 145 lbs and 5 ft. Size 34 D.


Great dress for a great price! I got it in red and it is a true red, not really a rich red. I wore this with the rockabilly tutu skirt and got complements all night. I am a size 2 and ordered a small and fit great. A little large in the bust area (I'm a size A) but a padded bra fixed that issue.


I purchased an XL, and am a size 14 and 36DDD. Unfortunately the fabric felt like a curtain, and it was too long. The top was difficult to zip up, and I couldn't get it over my chest. Unfortunately had to return.


I was very pleased  with  this  dress. Lovely  material  and  it  fit perfectly .  I  will  not  hesitate  to  buy  another one. I love  it .


Fit perfect! Just what I needed for my daughters seniors cruise night. Bought a petticoat to put underneath and it just gave it just the lil extra punch it needed to look old hollywood(Audrey Hepburn like)â�¤ï¸�5'7 125 pounds.


Dissapointed... if your short this is not the dress for you...


I am 5'7, 177lbs, 38D, & 33" waist. I ordered the XL and it fit like a soft, satiny glove! This is a well made dress that fell just below the knee and is true to size and picture. I will be buying more soon!


Came fast, fits well, nice bit of stretch, vibrant color, classic look.


Perfect dress! First, I ordered this dress for my daughters graduation on a Sunday received it on Wednesday, same week. Second, the dress is just perfect! It fits immaculate! Glad I ordered!
