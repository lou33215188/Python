This item is too small.I ordered it for me but unable to wear as it is so small .Had to return it.very cheaply made.Very much disappointed


I do not care for the ribbon at all. It seems quite cheap and there were strings hanging from it as though it wasn't cut and stitched properly. The dress itself is cute and the fits nicely.


Very nice quality. Dress is as depicted, though a little tight in the bust . . . but #womanly boobs. Worth the money.


Really cute dress and a very flattering cut.  The fabric is stretchy and soft and the stitching is good quality.  Great buy!


The dress itself is really pretty and looks just like the picture. However the dress was a little smaller than expected. I am planning on returning...


I liked the dress very thick fabric but since it was bagged it came wrinkled so I had to take get tailored I'm 5'3 and dress fit pretty long but I guess that's the style.


Loved this dress! Surprised of the quality when I saw the price. Wrinkles easily, but I can handle that for 20 dollars. Also red bow is not attached


Great dress came fast shipping.  The red ribbon that was delivered with the dress left a large stain on the front of the dress


Perfect love it


This was a beautiful royal blue dress. My 16 year old daugther wore it to a Rainbow Tea and she loved it and received many compliments.
