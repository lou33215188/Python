Bought this dress to wear at my school winter carnival. It is a perfect fit, very nice fabric, great quality. Wore it with a black petticoat, but even without that the skirt is full and has a great feel. Received loads of compliments. Will definitely buy in other colors as well. I am 5'9'' and the length was perfect.


Love how the top fit. If you are a fuller sized girl then you will need to have the bottom taken in. Makes you look larger than you are.


Still it would be beautiful for a tall thin woman


My daughter wore it for an orchestra concert!  Prettiest dress on her ever!!  Looks elegant and sophisticated!


LOVE THIS DRESS.  So comfortable and pretty


It looks great and absolutely flattering and the colour is amazing. It also washes well. Takes a lil more time and care to iron but its a great inexpensive buy and addition to the closet.


love the fabric, fit and design of this dress.  holds up well after washing.  very comfortable.


The moment I saw this print I knew I had to have it! The picture doesn't do this beautiful dress justice. The fabric is great quality and the fit was perfect. You can use a pettiecoat for added volume, but it definitely has enough fullness without it.


Material is rough


My daughter loved this dress!


Beautiful dress just not enough room for my girls!
