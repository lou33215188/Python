Very pretty.  Doesn't look inexpensive.


Flawless just wish it wasn't so wrinkled!! Lol


Was so worried about not sizing up like other reviewers suggested. I am typically a size 4 and the small was a perfect fit. I will probably buy more in other colors. The dress looks so great. My dress falls just below the knee, I'm 5' 3"


Fits perfectly. I love the design and the fabric. Definitely keeping it.


Great dress and I paired it with a vintage net slip and skinny belt...Tons of compliments


great price. fits great better material than expected


Fits well however you need to get a petticoat for it to look good.


Not as pretty in real life


Beautiful dress. It wrinkles very easy and if too tight it hurts your arm pits. With all that I still wear this and love it.


I'm 4'11 and usually wear a size 12-14, I read the reviews and ordered an X-Large or XX-Large in this dress. The X-Large fit a little snug, but was a better fit than the XX-Large, length for me was perfect. I've already ordered 3 of these dresses and plan on ordering more! They are well made and I get lots of compliments on them! LOVE them!!
