Bought it for my mommy along with the petticoat. She has style like Joan crawford and I felt this would accent her wardrobe. As I thought, she loves loves loves it. I can't wait to see her wear it!


I really like the dress it is just as I expected it would be


ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! True to size. Great price. I can't wait for my event so I can wear it!!!


Great dress for price especially


I like the vintage style, and the price is right.  This dress fits well and I really like this shade of blue.


I usually wear a size 14 and the XX Large fit perfectly!


Absolutely beautiful and it fits perfectly


Perfect dress for my daughter's Halloween costume that she'll be able to wear again.


It fits just as expected! I will be wearing it for my sorority initiation if I make it through in August. It is true to size and fits exactly how I hoped it would!


Love it can't wait to wear it to work.
