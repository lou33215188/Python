GREAT DRESS! I feel so comfortable in it!


Very classy and elegant! Nice color!


I LOVE IT!


I'm 5'2", 115lbs and size small fit perfect. Falls nicely after washing in cold water and ironing. Delivered as scheduled. Can't beat the price!


Yes. Audrey Hepburn has left the building. Its so cute, classy, ladylike and fits exactly how I expected.


I was less than impressed by this product.  It ran small, and the material seemed cheap.  I returned, and would not buy again.


True to their size, very beautiful color too. I will definitely buy another color. Very comfortable to wear. I use mine for a wedding and got a lot of compliments.


This dress is adorable, however I'm 5'9 and it still almost comes to my calf. Would love for it to be a wee bit shorter but the material is sturdy and it fits the description. Very happy.


Love the dress, I bought it for my wife. It was a little smallish up top for a fairly busty woman, but fit great and looks awesome otherwise!


Perfect


This dress is very nice. The color fit and material all are very good. I haven't worn it yet but the only potential problem I see is it may wrinkle easily..Other than that it was a good purchase.


Bought this for my friend who loves Audrey Hepburn. Followed the chart and it fit her perfectly!!
