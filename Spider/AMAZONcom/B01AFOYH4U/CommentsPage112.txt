This dress is so beautiful and fits very comfortably. I was surprised how much give it has around the high waist and chest area which is great. The color is gorgeous, shipping was quick, quality is great. Will definitely order more colors in the future!


The style and quality of this dress is simple and beautiful!  The fit is flattering no matter what your figure-type is!  We made sure to take measurements before ordering the proper size.  Love the raspberry colored polka dots too!


This dress was way better than what i expected! The color was a bright red. It does come extremely wrinkled and tends to get wrinkled while being worn. Which is why i didnâ€™t give it 5 stars.


Cheap and poor quality of material. I would only wear this to a casual get together at most. It was definitely not what I expected


This dress is amazing! Especially for the price. It's very Audrey Hepburn. I usually wear a 12 and I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly. I'll be buying it in more colors soon!


Love the look and style! Only reason I gave it a 3 star was because my zipper kept splitting open at an event i was attended, so it was a little embarrassing. The dress fit perfect and it wasn't to tight...thinking it just my have been a defect with zipper, however the style and quality is really nice so I'll just deal with it with the zipper issue!ğŸ˜Œ


LOVE this dress. It fits very well, so flattering. Great quality


Love it. I'll be getting more. I wore it for my birthday with a petticoat but I think I can  wear it without for a more casual look. The waistline also needs to be higher. I'm 5'6, 157 lbs and got a large, but medium would of fit as well. Nothing a belt didn't remedy.


My daughter loved how this fit and looked on her.  She's happy, I'm happy!


The material is not nice, ironed it and it still looks wrinkled.
