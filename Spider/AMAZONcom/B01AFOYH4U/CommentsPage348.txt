Nice fit. I ordered a small.


Would look ten times better with a cremlin for fullness feature


Beautiful dress!


Pretty but a little smaller than I thought at the top.


The dress was  awesome fit  the material Wrinkled when you  sat down I might should have gotten it hard starched at the  dry cleaner but it was nice


Beautiful dress, fits great!


It didn't even fit, it ripped, and was always wrinkly no matter how many times I ironed it.


Beautiful dress, quality and fits great.


My daughter loved it and is taking it to Vegas!


It fit perfectly! I'm a 40 DDD and I got a 3x!
