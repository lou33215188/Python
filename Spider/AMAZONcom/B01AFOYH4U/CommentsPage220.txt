My boyfriend said I looked like a doll. :)


Not happy with it ! Very transparent. Will need a full under garment to wear with it. Don't recommend this dress. Price is cheap so is the dress!


Will have to be ironed- a lot- but perfect for a costume.


This dress is perfect! High quality thick fabric and gorgeous style. Can't wait to wear it out!


Very nice dress, bought for my daughter and she loves it. Great material and fits her well. I would recommend this dress and will likely biy more colors in the future.


It is so sweet, love it. It fits perfectly !!


Very impressed with color and quality of fabric...I felt it was a bit boxy thru the bodice...feeling too large, so I did return it...but in a proper fit, which I reordered in purple...it is lovely!


whatever size you are buy one size up. I bought my actual size and washed it in cold... can't wear again. It shrank. Disappointed!


I've never worn this style and I'm trying to change up my wardrobe. To my surprise the dress fits perfect and is flattering. I LOVE IT!


Perfect size... I was in between getting a medium and a large... Very glad i went with the medium... Looks very classy.
