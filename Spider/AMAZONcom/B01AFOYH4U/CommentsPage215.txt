Cheap thin material. Not worth the money.  I wear a 2X and it was a Large. Very disappointing as I needed it for a wedding.


My daughter wore this dress to her 5th grade graduation and everyone said she looked amazing thanks!!!


Perfect, just as the picture , material is nice and it fits very good i will definately by more colors


Bought for daughter who is long waisted. Looks amazing and material is great weight and drapes wonderfully.  Daughter is 5'9" 160lbs and a small waist. This dress is cut perfect and satisfies her retro/vintage obsession. Also bought a tutu petticoat to wear for more fullness.


The dress was smaller around my arms than I expected. Other than that it fit perfect and is a lovely dress.


Beautiful dress - fits very nicely and looks just like the photo.  Highly recommend if you're into this style.  Looks great with and without the underskirt.


Fits like a glove!  Absolutely love this dress!


For the price, this dress is very cute. Will definitely get me through the holidays, though the quality is that of a $20 dress so it may not last much longer. I got an underskirt to give it a little more volume, and it looks really great.


The dresses were too long. Other than that, they are great. I love the material. I wish there was a model on the purchasing list wearing it. So people would know how long the dress is..


I bought this dress for my wife as a surprise.  She's loves it and it fit perfect.  The only negative was  there was a 4 inch hole - the stiching had come undone at the bottom of the zipper.  Luckily we were able to stitch it up.  There was also no washing instructions.
