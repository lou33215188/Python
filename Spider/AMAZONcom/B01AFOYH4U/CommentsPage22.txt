I adore this dress. The material is a little stiff, but I am sure it will relax some with wear and washing. It is very flattering and modest. I bought it to be able to change out shoes and belts!


OK I ordered this dress in an XXL. The fit was perfect! I'm 5"5 and about 230 pounds. I carry most of my weight in my hips and I wear a pants size 18 or a 20 depending on cut. Now with that being said my waist is much smaller and I'm a 38DD up top. The dress cut perfect up top. And it hits right below my knees. I bought a petticoat with it to make it a little more full. I have no complaints at all about this dress! I actually bought another one in black and pink. I will say it says not to dry clean which I was a bit sad about but I'll just be washing it by itself in cold water and hang drying it and ironing it on a low setting. It's worth it for a dress that makes you feel beautiful ğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œ


I normally where a US size 14-16.  40ish C cup. It was a bit peachier in color then I expected; but I have received so many compliments that I've fallen in love with it. Peach is not one of my normal colors. The fabric was surprisingly comfortable & easy to care for. The fit was dead on with the size charts supplied by seller. This seller is definitely being added as a favorite for the 1st person & proactive approach to the sale. I'm absolutely delighted! ~Alexis


This is such a cute dress! I bought a petticoat (SlenyuBridal Women's Vintage 50s Rockabilly Petticoat Tutu Skirt 26" Length Crinoline Underskirt Royal Blue X-Large) in the same color and this is adorable! It needed some steaming, but that's to be expected. It is just slightly too big in the bust (I'm 5-7/12", 255 pounds, c-cup) but I had a breast reduction a few years' back. I ordered a XXXL based on the reviews and I'm glad I did (I normally wear a size 20 or XXL).


I usually fit into a large but per other reviews I got the XL. It fits well but is large enough that I can just slip it on and off without undoing the zipper. So I could probably do the large. Going by that I would say that this is true to size and if you aren't borderline sizes, go with what you normally wear. I wanted a cheapish dress to wear to a funeral because I didn't have the intentions of wearing it that often or even again for that matter.  But it honestly looks so cute and is made fairly well that I'm thinking of getting it hemmed to use for more occasions.


Overall, this dress is okay, but if I didn't hate exchanging so much, I would probably get a different dress. The fabric of this dress feels pretty cheap, and wrinkles easily, but it isn't see through. I like the length of the dress, I'm 5'3" and it comes below my knees, but I don't like the fit as much. I have a 30" waist and got a medium, which fits perfectly, but the shoulders are a little looser then I'd like, and can look unflattering at times. I bought this dress for a one-times dance, so it'll be fine for that, but if your looking for something to wear multiple times, or to a special occasion I'd keep looking(:


This is a very flattering style for my hour Glass figure. It also has a beautiful pattern and seems to be of good quality. I have not washed it yes, so I can not attest as to for how easy it is to take care.


I can comment on the fit. It first beautifully. I have 34 D bust and with size small it looks nice. I am also 5'5 135 lbs and the S  fits well and is a good length, just below knee.


Overall, very pleased.


I am 5' 3" and 170 lbs, so from reading the different reviews, I expected it to run small and ordered an X-Large. The XL was surprisingly a bit roomy and it was alot longer than i expected, like almost mid calf. So if you are maybe 5' 8" with a 38-39 inch waist, i think this will be a perfect fit. I will order a large as well and possibly sell the XL to a friend who wanted to order the same dress. But a very nice and pretty dress, and the neckline didn't look weird when I put a cardigan with it. :) ---Maria V.


Great dress! Fits a little small; I am five feet tall and 135 pounds, and usually wear a 6 or small in dresses.  The medium fits great!  I love the light material, I can make this work for all seasons by wearing a cardigan and tights in cold weather.  It's classic and seems well made.  The bottom is swingy and you could add a poofy slip underneath if you wanted it to have more oomph and shape.  I like it as is.  I also think you could dress this up or down and it's very versatile.  I tried several of this style of dress and this is the one I recommend going with.


I needed a simple but elegant white dress for an event..Ordered a large..fits well on this 5'3"/38 bust frame. However it's NOT LINED!!! The white colored one DEFINETLY NEEDS a slip and cami underneath it...otherwise it's see through!1 Petticoat is a beautiful addition to it!!Mine came with a bright (funny) red ribbon...I used another colored ribbon to go with my color scheme...looked nice!
