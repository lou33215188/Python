This is ridiculous, I'm not able to contact anyone about this but I returned this item because it was not what I wanted. The white dress looks like an outfit you would wear at a hospital. But I sent it back and they issued a refund. Then two months later they pulled the money back out of our account because they said they didn't get it. I have proof they did. Also the fit was huge. It hangs way down past your knees.


I'm happy with this dress. It fits well and the pattern is great.


Super cute and was delivered quickly!


Beautiful dressğŸ˜†


Runs a little big


It is a snug fit, but the cut is really cute.  Also, the material is almost papery, but in black it doesn't really matter.  Cute dress


I absolutely love this dress! The fit is perfect, material is great. Overall just wonderful. I'm extremely happy.
