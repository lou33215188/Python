I love this dress - I got a small and am 5'6 / 140 lbs and I found the small to fit a little loose. I can still wear it though and its a great dress to go swing dancing in.


I just bought this dress and was so excited to wear it to work since summer in AZ is unbarable. I bought the yellow one and it has already stained from the washing detergent. I'm so upset. I have tried everything to get it out and it won't come out.


Look and smell worn, will be returning.


Pretty dress but you'll need to size up from the chart. Had to return, it was not going to zip, barely got it off!


I LOVE THIS DRESS!!!


The color is gorgeous, beautiful fit.


Snug as a bug!! Greatest. Dress. With or without a petticoat, btw


No problem with it I love it


I purchased this and another dress for a formal garden party I will be attending.  This dress fit and I have two belts that can easily be paired with it!  YAY!  The second dress was a TOM'S WARE and unfortunately, the XL didn't fit as nicely as I had hoped, but I'm keeping the ANNI COCO dress.  Thank you!


Wow


Beautiful dress with great cut. Well made!
