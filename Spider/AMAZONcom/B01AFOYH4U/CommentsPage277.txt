Has red around polka dots???


I love this dress! I love the color, weight of the fabric, the way it fits ... I just love it.  I am 5'4", 34" bust. I purchased a medium.


Perfect fit, the fabric is very good, does'nt look cheap. Overall I recommend this and looking for a different color to order for. Very fast shipping.


I always buy a little bigger when shopping online. I got my dress the next day as expected and it fit great! I got lots of compliments.


Dress was comfortable and pretty, definitely wrinkly when pulled out of the bag. Fit just right. Returned right away because the zipper was just a pain.


I absolutely love the dress. I bought white for an occasion, and the fit and length are perfect. I'm 5'9", it looks amazing on and I will definitely be ordering other colors, especially the black.


Love these dresses. I purchased the blue first and now the red one. Super cute


I loved this dress was a little big. I ordered a large. Should have gotten the Med.


Love the fit, but it is way to long.  Not like the picture showed


A lil bit small but good quality
