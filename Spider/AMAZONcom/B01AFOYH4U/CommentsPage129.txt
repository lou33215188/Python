It's exactly what we hoped it would be. Fits my daughter perfectly!!!


This one fit as expected.  Thank you


Light weight summer dress-- very nice with a quick delivery


I bought for my 18 yr old daughter. She loved it!! Very well made. It’s NOT made cheap. My daughter is 5”3 weighs 121 lbs and the size small fit perfect! We are very satisfied and will be ordering other colors.


Nice material, but a bit too small.


Wonderful dress. I am 5' 6" and weight 185, the XL was perfect.


Too big for me- but I got smallest size so I will just have it altered because I like the color and style


RIBBON NAH.NICE DRESS OTHERWISE


Beautiful dress top coud be a bit looser overall nive dress


It did fit as expected, but I'll be sending this back. The tag says 95% cotton 5% spandex. The outside of the dress feels like a soft plastic, not quite as rubbery as a raincoat. I am not happy with it at all. Would not recommend it to anyone.
