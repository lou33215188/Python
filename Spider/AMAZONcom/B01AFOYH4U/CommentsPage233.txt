LOVE this dress, I plan on buying more! I don't write many reviews, but this dress was beautiful & fit perfect! I sized up one size as directed.


This dress was exactly how it is previewed and described. I purchased it to wear at my best friends bridal shower and it was a total hit. This was one of the most comfortable and beautiful dresses I now own. I am going to purchase the other patterns.


Really like the way this dress fit me!  It's made of a cotton poplin type of fabric (I think that's what it's called). It's a stiffer fabric like a cotton dress shirt which makes it lay nice and feel dressy.  I bought this dress for an up coming wedding.


Got a completely different dress! Not at all what I needed for my costume....massively disappointed as it came, was completely different and the zipper was broken :(


This was a 2x that fit like an extra large or 1x. High end dresses the XL fits me comfortably. But this gives me incentive to loose more weight!


This dress was everything I wanted! I am 5'6, weigh about 186lbs, and 36DDD... I purchased the XL and it fit perfectly! Not tight at all. I received so many compliments at my coworkers wedding tonight! I plan on buying more colors soon!


Great dress!  I love it!!!


Beautiful dress just runs smaller in the chest area. Proceed return super fast and received refund just as fast.


Beautiful dress. Very well made. Simple yet elegant. I'm looking forward to wearing this dress both casual and dressing up with jewelry for a formal look.


Absolutley LOVE this dress! So excited to add it to my wardrobe! :)
