I always get compliments when I wear this dress! Very flattering to my figure!


Beautiful dress, fits very well.


Love it


Cheap fabric and runs small.


The dress runs a little small, so order a size up (which I had done after reading other reviews). This dress is *gorgeous*! It fits me perfectly and I've already ordered more. I've never had a dress fit my figure so well (I'm very busty and hippy). The dress is a nice thick material, too. I highly recommend this, especially if you're curvy.


I followed the chart and ordered a size up per the chart and all the recommendations and it was way too big in all areas. Also, the pretty color turquoise is not the true color of the dress - it's more of a dull periwinkle.


Dress is beautiful and well made. A little small but I am exchanging it for a bigger size. Worth the price & the make of the dress. Pleasantly surprised by the overall quality. Dress was one of my Mom's 1st online dresses. She loves it! So pretty! :)


5'7 176 pounds 36DDD (Soma)... size XL fit like a glove (electric blue)


It is okay.


Lovely dress. Very elegant and fits perfectly.


I love this dress! It is pretty and the material is good quality. The cobalt blue color is amazing and bright. I ordered a large and it was a little too big for me. I am short and it would need some alteration to the bottom to be a flattering length on me.
