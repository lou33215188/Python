Cute dress for formal occasions.


Fit well and got many compliments.


Beautiful design... but the quality is very poor


Fit a little loose. Not the best material!


A bit longer than I had imagined, but still wearable. The fabric is not as soft as I had expected. It's still a very nice dress.


Makes me feel like a Hollywood Classy Lady!


I am very impressed, it's like the dress was made right for me.


Well made and good fabric, rich color. But it runs small and short in the waist. XL is about a size 10,11.


It's a very lovely dress but the black ribbon was off.


more cream than white
