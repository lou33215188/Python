Perfect! Will be buying more!


I did the woman thing and had this in my closet for weeks before wearing it.  Once I put this dress on I was upset with myself for not wearing it sooner  This is one beautiful, comfortable, dress.  I am ordering the black one next; to have for that more upscale occasion.


The fabric is more denim feeling than the pictures show. There is nice stretch to the fabric though which is nice. It is also not as white as the picture indicates. More of an off-white than bright white. Overall it works for what I wanted.


A BIT LARGE TO BE A SMALL. LONG ENOUGH. AFTER FIRST WASH, IT WILL SHRINK. I HAD TO GIVE IT TO A TEENAGER.


I normally wear a size 10-12 and ordered this in a large. It fit perfectly! Got a lot of compliments. The fabric is not too thick or thin and it is very comfortable. I will be ordering in other colors!


Love the dress


This is the first time ordering clothing online through Amazon so I was a little skeptic on the fit but when it came in, I was very pleased with my purchase and especially for the price! I bought this dress for work since we have designated colors for each day at the office and it was the perfect shade and fit as expected. I would definitely recommend this dress.


I like this dress. A classic look. I ordered a size four. For the waist perfectly but the bust area is too big. I'm a 34 A so kinda was expecting this.


This dress is beautiful, this is my third purchase and I'm in love with these dresses!


A group of us bought this as a marching dress for a performance.  Where it may be fine for some of the girls, the smallest size was gigantic on several. Wish there was smaller options. It is a lightweight, flowy dress. Simple, clean lines.
