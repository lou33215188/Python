Loved this dress!!!  I am not one to wear dresses and I absolutely loved this dress!  I loved the color, the material and the way it fit. I received so many compliments on it too.


Adorable! Love this dress and the way it fits!


This dress did not have a tapered waist as shown in the photo description. I ordered based on measurements given and it looked like a moo moo. Not pleased at all! Horrible dress.


Great quality for the price


dress was pretty, sizing runs small, had to return


Beautiful dress but the zipped jammed and then came off the first time I tried to wear it while I was out of town and it was the only dress I had for the evening. Very frustrating.


I love this dress! Great quality but shotty zipper


Love love love the dress! Exactly what I wanted!!!
