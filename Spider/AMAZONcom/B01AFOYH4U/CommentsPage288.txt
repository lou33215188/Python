was bigger than expected, so hoping to exchange. such a cute dress!


It's a beautiful dress, however the zipper is very stiff and flimsy.


I ordered an XL and I typically where a size 12 and am a size 36DDD.


Great dress! I'm 5/2 and 130 pounds and I ordered a medium. It fits nicely-- nice too tight but not baggy. Love the fabric. Now I want more dresses like this!


Probably better in black. White was very plain & be because I'm long wasted the top portion was up to high for me. Good quality though!


happy with my purchase, fits perfect was true to size. got lots of complements when i wore it to church.


Somewhar large, but I like it!


Great Fabric, bought it for Choir group


I wore this to my Fiance's military Christmas party and got a TON of compliments! I'm only 5 feet tall, so I was kind of worried about the length, but it actually looked great! I liked this dress so much, I'm buying another one (in a different color) for my upcoming Bridal Shower!


Love this dress! Fits perfect and comfortable material. So classy and sexy.
