Cure but definitely too small. I wear a 14 and ordered a 16/18. I couldn't get it zipped.  ğŸ˜£


got a number of compliments but feels tight


Beautiful dress!  Nicely made.  So I returned the large and got the next size.  A little roomy but will be perfect for my event!


Cute, basic dress. Fit is a little tight in the rib cage, but maybe that's just me. Good quality and shape. I got the black v-neck and I really like it


The dress fit perfectly, no alterations needed.


It was awesome. Love it


I bought this dress for my daughter and it's fit perfect! Please look at the size chart. Match your measurements in the waist. You may have to get the bust area altered.


Nice dress but cheap zipper .


This dress is phenomenal!! It's a little roomy in the chest, but not by much. I'm between a 14/16 and ordered an xl. It was perfect! I'm wearing it to the rehearsal dinner. When I showed my fiancÃ©, he may have welled up.


I love it the look and the fit is beautiful !!!!!
