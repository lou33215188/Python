This dress is ahhhhmazing! It's much more than what I expected! At 5'8" and 195lbs. I ordered the xxl. It is super flattering. It also came in a very nice ziplock pouch. I think I'm going to order more right now!


This wasn't exactly what I thought it was. It was a little long on me and really fit weird. The shoulders were big n the bust was tight. The blue is very pretty. I used it for a costume.


Meh. A little on the small side, fabric seems a little cheap, might look better in a darker color. Wound up returning it.


We ordered a size bigger and the next size fit perfect


Ok I was able to try it on and zip it up so the fit was true.  But the material was stiff and the style unflattering so I returned it.


My first impression of this dress is that the fabric is very thin, cheaper than what I was expecting. However cut and fit of the dress is very classy. It's a good thing lightweight cotton dress for warm weather.


Just a little bit too big... I knew I should have sized down, but based on the reviews, I went up. I have a pretty small frame. It's not so big that I can't wear it, it just doesn't fit as snug as I hoped. But, the color is great. Dress is beautiful! Happy with the purchase! :)


Great dress!! My daughter picked this out for her school dance and we love it!! It’s classy with spunk and the best part is it’s modest. Well made, fits great, looks cute.


Beautiful dress, fits great! Slightly stretchy, good quality material, flows and twirls. I’m very happy with this purchase, will probably buy more patterns soon!


I wear a size 8 in all my dresses and a medium in shirts and 8-10 in pants. The dress fit as expected very nicely. I have braid shoulders so sometimes stuff fits oddly but I am impressed with this dress. I bought a petticoat to add more volume and I received an abundance of compliments. Goes very well with pearl jewelry.
