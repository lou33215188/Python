It's not as nice as I was hoping. The fabric is a little thin so the dress is almost see through in some places


I ordered this for a wedding in July.  I tried it on right when I got it and it fit fine.  I put it on in early July and the zipper is broken, without me ever having worn it or taken off the tags.  I have missed my return window.


Great material


Priceless


I looked slim in this.....I felt fantastic!!


Beautiful dress, i bought mine in red. Arrived on time im 5 ft and it is tea length on me. Great fabric.


Exactly what I wanted!


Looks awful in person.


Perfect! The skirt has TONS of fabric. Looks fantastic with or without petticoat. Will be buying more in different patterns!


Way too tight in the chest. Going back.
