Perfect for work, hits me right at the knees and fits very well. Looks cute with most shoes.


Great fit and flattering, I was afraid the material would be too thin and could see through it,  But it was a good strong material that still moves.  I am 5ft 2in and ordered a large and it wasn't too big.  I will definitely order another color soon.


I loved how the dress fits. It's light and came in a nice sealable bag for future storage.  I love it!!


a little longer then expected but still a very pretty dress.


This is a great cocktail dress.


The dress is so cute,  I love the style.  But it would not zipper up. I am so sad,  I needed it for a special occasion & it has been a nightmare to find this color.


AWSOME dress


It was exactly like picture i was amaze at the price seen the material is lovely


Great dress but it is NOT white - it is off white. I had to return it.


It’s nice, I’m between sizes but wish I had gone smaller. Slightly wrinkled, but nothing an iron or steamer can’t fix.
