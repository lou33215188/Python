It fit my daughter beautifully.  Nice material and well made.


Too small for stated size.


Adorable dress.  Fit great and received compliments.  Ribbon it comes with is kind of cheap but I just replaced with a cute belt.

lovely dress...the top was a bit snug


Beautiful dress, however, don't know who could wear it!  I am a 36C and usually wear a size 12.  The XL fit in the waist but did not come close to zipping in the chest area!


Great and fast shipping!


ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DRESS. Fits perfectly, long enough, is super comfortable fabric and great color!
