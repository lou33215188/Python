It was lovely


Cut too small


Long and dust collector


I ordered this dress for my daughter and she looked amazing in it.  The fabric was good quality and ironed well and the fit was right on.


Perfect for our party!!


Very pretty dress. Love the color and style. Sized up but still a little tight in the bust.


It would have been a good fit for me but my breast don't fit. Pulled too much on the top with no give in the material.


Awful fabric quality; it felt like I was wearing a dollar store-bought bed sheet. And the stitching was already frayed/coming out. 0/10.


Love the dress. Fits perfectly. Material better than I expected


Love love LOVE this dress.
