nice


love this dress!!! fits as expected!


Fits great I love it!


Everything I expected!! The fit was perfect, and the material is thick so it's not see through at all.. The dress falls right under my knee so it will be perfect for any event.. Worth every penny!!


I'm a 42D 39 inch waist. Ordered XXL and it fit perfect with just a little moving room. Not too tight anywhere. Good quality material.


The bust of the dress is slightly too tight, but nothing to worry about. All in all a beautiful dress.


Perfect!


It didn't take long at all to receive (3 days) it was small and I ordered a size larger than my size. Love the dress


The dress is really cute.  Unfortunately, I'm disappointed to say that it's too big.I ordered a medium but it doesn't fit.


In the process of returning it right now. It fit like a tent!
