I love this dress. As other reviewers said it does run a bit small. I am 5'1", and 139 lbs. I usually wear a 4/6 or small. I bought the medium based on other reviews. It was slightly big in the chest. After a wash and dry it shrank just enough to be a perfect fit.


Amazing dress. Great quality and fits true to size!  Bought this for my daughters graduation and she looks absolutely amazing.


fit around well but the hem was uneven. still got many compliments though.


Loved the color and style but it was way too small. I'm 5'6 curvy and the zipper didn't come close to closing. I got a medium since I'm usually a size 8. I'm returning it.


The dress is out of proportion; the hem is much longer than it should be, even for a "vintage" style. It reached down to my calves.


Also, when I received the dress it SMELLED LIKE SMOKE. Seriously! It was disgusting!


This dress fit just as the size chart described.  I am 5'4", 134 lbs with 36" DD and the medium fit great.  Snug in all the right places and never felt confined.  I would definitely recommend this dress if your'e looking for vintage style.


This dress was a hit on Easter, I will be buying more


My daughter chose this dress for a party she's invited to. I'm always cautious to order clothing online for her. I was so pleasantly surprised! It's a beautiful dress, fits perfectly and is well made. We'll be ordering more dresses from this seller for sure.


Wore this for Easter. So many compliments. great fit


It's an absolutely beautiful dress, but not true to size.  I purchased four dresses of the same size.  Two fit well.  One was too snug.  This one (same size label as the two that fit) wouldn't even zip up.  However, I am keeping it.  It's beautiful... and an incentive to keep losing weight in order to fit into it.
