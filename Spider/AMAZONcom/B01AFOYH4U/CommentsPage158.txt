Even better than I expected.  Ordered an XL and probably could have done a L, but it worked!


Very nice dress, fits great, good quality, pretty and price is can't be beat.  Will be buying more colors and patterns.


This is a lovely dress!  Fits nicely size 4 Petite.  Well made and looks like a more expensive dress.


Very cute I put a leopard belt and heels with it and a funky necklace turned out so cute! Great buy ğŸ˜Šâ�¤ï¸�


Beautiful dress but cheap quality. I just wore it for the second time and the zipper completely came off the other side. It's a shame as I wanted to buy more! The dress is a little too big so it's not like I was trying to squeeze into it either.


I initially bought this dress to be worn as part of a Halloween costume. I will definitely be wearing this to more formal events. This dress is much higher quality than I thought it would be even after reading reviews. The packaging was something I would expect from a boutique store.


Super cute dress!


A little more boxy up in the shoulders - Not the look I anticipated, but I will keep it incase I go to a wedding, etc.


I love the dress. The fabric is nice, the slight spandex makes it perfect and comfortable to wear. It looks great on my daughter. Problem? I bought it for me. Sizing is deceiving, I believe.


The color is amazing! I ordered one size up and it fit perfectly.  I loved the packaging and how fast it arrived. Thanks again!
