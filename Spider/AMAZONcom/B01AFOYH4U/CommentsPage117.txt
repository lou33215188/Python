It exceeded my expectations. The last dress I ordered online ran small so I order this dress in a larger size. Big mistake. It fits true to size so I was swimming in it lol.


Awesome dress! Very slimming! My only complaint would be the material attracts lint. But that's why a lint roller was invented ;-)!


Fits great and feels great. I am 6ft tall with super long legs so it's not as long on me as someone of average hight yet it isn't a mini skirt so I am thrilled. The dress is super comfy and looks amazing. Might just have to get another in another color!


The dress is beautiful and I will keep it.. just a bit disappointed that I ordered the v-neck dress and did not receive that one.. I paid more for the v-neck one I really wanted for about $26.. but got one that was listed for $19


Made great the red isn't for me but I got this in the solid navy and it's a great little dress


Absolutely adorable, fit as expected (definitely did not need to order a size up, although I did just in case get two and returned the larger). Very nice quality, highly recommend.


I really like it, fit as expected and loved the color. the only problem is I would love a underlining for the dress.


Loved the packaging and the length of the dress. The price does the material no justice! Great material and durable. With a petticoat, the dress flared just right


The fit and color are great.  I look forward to wearing it year round as I think it will make for a fun Holiday dress in the winter but a nice bright green suitable for spring and summer.


Material was horrible. Item was returned.
