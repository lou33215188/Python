Haven't tried it on yet. Don't know how it will fit, however I like the design.


I love this dress! I've worn it in family pictures and received tons of compliments.


Cute, nice fabric with a little stretch. Like it without a petticoat but would look more period with one. Good buy for the price.


The sizinget on this was crazy off this was like 5 sizes too big! So long and boxy.


I love this dress. It's the perfect length, and fits like a dream. I'm 5'8 and 250 and the XXL is just right.


I bought size XL even though I normally wear M because of the reviews saying it was small. The proportions were way off.  The waist fit well, but the bust/shoulders were huge and it was a bit long for me. I had to return it.  I was buying to use as a costume. Would have been cute if it fit properly.


DIL wanted this for her birthday. It fit well and she looks beautiful in it!


Definitely runs a little small as reviews suggested,so I ordered one size up which was a little big. Nothing a hit wash and dry couldn't fix.  Looks so cute and definitely decent quality for the price.  Can't wait to wear it for my wedding shower


I absolutely love this dress.  I have 3 more in my cart to order on payday!


It seemed like good quality but it was see-through,and super wrinkled...ironing might be necessary but I can't deal with see-through.
