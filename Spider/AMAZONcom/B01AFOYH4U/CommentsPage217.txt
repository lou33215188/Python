The dress is beautiful. The fabric is soft and pleasant, and everything fits as it should. I love the full skirt on the dress.


Fit oddly and was stiff. Skirt flares out at bottom.


A little bigger than I expected and much longer- hits just below my knee and I ordered a Large and I'm 5' 6". Beautiful though. Definitely will want to add a belt for a pop of color but it's gorgeous.


I was a little worried that it wouldn't fit over my large breasts because a friend was telling me she got the same dress and it was tight on her, but the dress fit perfectly on me! I got so many compliments!


I received the wrong dress (wrong print). It was also too large. The style is cute but I ordered a plain color & received a floral print.. waited too long to return it so I'm stuck with it.


Very comfy but thicker material. I was a little warm. I like it.


This dress was better than I expected.  It's being used as a costume, so I didn't want to spend a lot.  I "thought" it was going to be made of thin, cheaper, fabric, but to my surprise, it's well made of durable cotton.  I'm very pleased with this dress.


Great


This dress fit gorgeously!  It was purchased for a funeral and wore very elegantly and feminine.  I will not hesitate to purchase more colors for other occasions.


My daughter loves it!
