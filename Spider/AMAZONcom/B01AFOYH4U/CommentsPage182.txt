I bought this dress for my 14 year old daughter's 8th grade graduation next month. It looks and fit great. I would definitely recommend this dress to anybody looking. As a matter of fact, I'm going to order another one in a different color.


Gorgeous dress! Good quality and I received many compliments. A+


I ordered 8 if these  dresses. All fit just well and arrived right away. The only downside is that the zipper is very cheap, so be careful putting it on. One of the zippers broke immediately, but the vendor had a replacement sent out within 2 days.


Great fit. True t size. Lovely & Elegant.


Used it for a halloween costume and it worked out well. Nice quality for the price.


The cut and length were perfect for my engagement party and the blue turned out to be a great compliment to my wedding colors. I got one in white as well to wear for other events. Love this dress!! Only thing missing is pockets!


Loved it ğŸ’–


The dress was Great.... sadly it was too big! I'm 5'2 113 lbs 34 26 ? And the small wasn't small enough.


Fabric is thinner then expected. But fits just like the guide. Nice dress


This dress is fabulous. The color, and style fit me like a model. Love the stretchy material.
