Fits me perfectly!  Love the fabric.


This dress is gorgeous. The zipper was a little tough to get up but I had no worry whatsoever that it would become a problem. I wore this for a wedding and was complimented by a ton of people.


Such a sweet and simple dress. The shape is very flattering & classic.


Absolutely adorable and flattering dress.  I will be buying in more colors!


Wow! This dress is amazingly beautiful! It fits perfectly! When I tried it on, I didn't want to take it off! The shipping was very fast as well!


This dress is awful & looks nothing like the picture. It is off white and very dingy like someone has worn it for years. Packed horribly. Crumpled up in plastic. It actually looks like a dirty-white version of a maid uniform.


I love this dress!! Fits perfect! I am a size 14 (large), but I chose an XL size for this dress. The material is thick,the colors are bright! Over all...super happy!! ğŸ˜€


This fits true to size most people equate a 2xl to fit a 16-20 US & it fits well


The dress was a bit tight but looked much better online than in person.  The fabric was not what I had hoped for, it was like a linen type weight and I prefer not to wear linen as it creases easily and it is harder to iron.... Good dress overall...


Perfect fit and looks wonderful!
