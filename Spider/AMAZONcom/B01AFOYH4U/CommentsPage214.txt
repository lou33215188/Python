This dress was a great buy. Showed up on time. Wore it to a work event and it was perfect for the occasion. Surprisinglyâ€‹ fit as expected which is rare. I will definitely be buying more dresses from Anni Coco.


This dress is perfect!! I'm usually a size 14 in dresses, and the large (12-14) fit me perfectly. I love this dress because I feel like it can look good on everyone, any size! I highly recommend purchasing one or multiple colors of this dress. I purchased the black. :)


The quality of material is really good. The dress fits nice. The dress came in a a special packaging that zips which protected the dress. Very satisfied customer. Will buy again.


Fits exactly as expected! The material quality is fantastic and not cheap at all. They even included a pretty satin waist bsnd6 with the dress. I will definitely be buying more!


Super cute, nicely made.


Loved the dress but it does run about the size small. Got 2 dresses for my wife, this one ran small.


Great dress even better price.  Can dress it up with heals or flats for more casual. Color is beautiful.  Really great dress.  So glad I bought this dress.
