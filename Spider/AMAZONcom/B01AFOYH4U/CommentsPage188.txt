It's a beautiful dress. My daughter loved it.


This dress was as cute as described, a little loose around the armholes. It didn't flatter me but I'm sure would flatter many others.


Love this dress! I'm a plus size gal size 16 and it hugs in all the right places and flares just right! Very modest and classy. I even order a small for my daughter and she looks beautiful in this dress.


My wife bought this and says the dress is great


Lovely dress, beautiful color! A petite size would have been ideal but it still looked good on. Quality was very good considering the price!


very cute, fits nice.  No need to wear a slip underneath.


Love the fit and feel of the fabric.  Runs a little long for women at the lower end of average height (5'4") but it really did not impact me that much.  Wear high heals.


I can not beleive this dress was only $20.00?!! I needed a black dress for an event and didn't feel like searching through stores - it's amazing! I'm 5"6 155 lbs ordered a medium and it fits perfect. Good material, comes down past my knee a little bit. Where was this even for my bridesmaids dresses


My daughter wore this dress with the added full crinoline slip, a silver/turquoise belt & black sparkly cowboy boots for a homecoming dance. It was perfect & she looked & felt wonderful in it. The price is unbeatable for the quality.


Very cute dress for $
