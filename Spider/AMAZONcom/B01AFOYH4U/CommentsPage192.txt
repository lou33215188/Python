The dress is beautiful, only thing the zipper by the sash I have to re-sew as the second time I tried it on came unstitched


Not what I expected. I ordered this to wear to my bridal shower and had to return it. I was so disappointed. Maybe it's just my body type but it was too long and just didn't fit right


Fit better than expected! It is perfect and super cute.


Ordered this dress for my daughter's Holy Communion.  Dress worked out fine but it was not a bright white more of a winter white or light ivory.


A lot of  other reviews said to go up a size, so I did to be careful. Now it fits a little loose, I could went with my normal size. The dress is still nicely made.


I have a large chest so the chest area was a bit snug. I ordered the size in which a woman similar in my size said she ordered. I think if I got a size larger, the top would've been too loose.


Sorry.....this is cheap fabric and lots of material! Beautiful color. Just made me look frumpy. I am a small petite, I think it would be great for a more voluptuous body!


love it


Just great!!!!! Can't wait to swing the nite away!


Looks just as pictured. Love it!! Fits well
