Good fabric and cut...


This dress was bought fr someone. Not only did she love it but she loves the thumbs ups she got from those who saw it.


Product came in on time. Product was just too big and had no time to exchange. had to return


I kept this black dress just because it's black and I can dress it up with a red sweater and accessories


This dress is PERFECT! I bought the "Vintage Woman's 50's rockabilly" petticoat & together they are absolutely amazing!!


I'm 5'8" 190#'S and it fit like a glove!


I bought this dress for my daughter to wear to homecoming.  It's true to size and is very flattering!


absolutely love this dress! exactly like the description and fit perfect


Fabric is thick, but soft. Fits well. Super happy with it.


Not as in picture it arrived with different color flowers.


Love the dress!! Will definitely purchase another dress!!!
