Love it! It is Audrey Hepburns style dress. Very nice fabric.


Needed a little black dress for an event and this one is perfect! Got compliments the first time I wore it. Comfortable, versatile and reasonably priced!


This dress Is adorable! I got a size large, and it fits perfectly! The dress is well made and comes right to my knee. I recommen buying a pettie coat with it to make it really fluffy! 5 out of 5


Great fit!


Love my dress I usually wear a size 16 ordered this in a XXL and it fits perfectly....


This dress fits perfect! I wear a size 4/6 jeans and weigh about 120 and wear medium tops and the medium size dress fits perfect. It would be tight on a larger chested young woman as I am not and it fits nicely ;-)


Beautiful dress, I got tons of compliments on it. I love this dress so much that I'm buying a second one in a different color!


This is a true find.  Extremely reasonably priced.  Looks like a million dollars.  The solid black is too dressy to wear for everyday or even work...will save it for a wedding or special occasion.


It was a medium at best!


This fits great! I got tons of compliments while wearing it. My measurements are approx. 37 x 33 x 38, with clothing layers. It went with the petticoat perfectly.
