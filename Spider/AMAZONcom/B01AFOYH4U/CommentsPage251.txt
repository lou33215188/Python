Got this dress for my daughter who was partaking in her class 50's era dress-up day. She absolutely loved it and it fit her perfectly. Though it was intentionally a one event dress, she plans on wearing it as often as she can.


loved, loved, great quality! looks just like pictures  A little tight but otherwise fine!


Nice dress, but SUPER long. I returned and lost a fee dollars as they charged a return fee.


Nice fit and fabric for the price. Love the pattern!


LOVED it!!


This a classy dress that you can dress up or down. Very comfortable and lady like.. I LOVE IT!!


Item was received with the zipper broken. I could tell that it was cheaply made and the fabric is incredibly see through. I returned it  and purchased a different dress. I would suggest not to purchase this dress.


Had to order a size larger however love the fit


Absolutely beautiful dress. Prefect fit


Dress fits perfectly. For those who say the dresses run small, maybe you need to be realistic about what size you really wear. Perfect fit and beautiful!
