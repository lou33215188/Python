Loved the material on this dress. Very pretty.


When I opened the package I was super excited then I found out the dress I ordered and the dress I received were different. I ordered a white dress but the dress I received was off white.


Very cute dress!  I can dress it up or down!  Great price!!!


Cons: you'll need to hand wash and iron it


Pros: $26 dress that easily resembles a $200+ designer version, beautiful and elegantly cut. I just received it today and I'm already buying another color. Versions by other manufacturers are not cut as well - I bought a similar dress from a different brand and the torso was very short, the fit was all wrong.


For reference, I wear a size 4-6 and the small was a comfortable fit. I also bought a petticoat to wear with it, which looked crazy stupid - this doesn't need anything. Wear it by itself.


Update: it's super staticky but holding up well. I bought black. Do not try the royal blue version- the fabric is shiny and it looks like a prom dress.


As expected but the top part was to small


I loved it


First time I bought clothes, that wasn't a t-shirt off the internet, I am surprised on how well it fits.


I absolutely love this dress! Color, fit and fabric are perfect! Great find and price!


Dress was too big andade of uncomfortable fabric


Love the dress!!!
