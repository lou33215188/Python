Love it! Fit perfect, I have large breast and I thought it would be too small but it fit just great!!!!


It fit as expected but turned out not really being my stlye.


absolutely love this dress.  the fabric is great and the color is gorgeous


The dress fit very well,  however, it had a strong vinegar smell.  Had to be washed twice.


Love it fast shipping


Bought it for my daughter to wear to a Derby gala.  She looked beautiful in it.


This dress fits perfect now that I ordered a small.


Adore this dress! Every time I wear it I get compliments. I will be ordering several in different colors.


This dress exceeded my expectations. Perfect fit, color, length and style. Received a lot of compliments and will buy more from this designer.


Perfect fit
