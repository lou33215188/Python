It's beautiful,  fits great !


I did not get to wear it because it had a hole at the zipper. I bought it for my son's wedding. I was so disappointed


It's a very pretty dress, and well made...unfortunately much too small.  I ordered a size up...but it wasn't enough...even with spanx...sadly.


Perfect fit. Pretty dress.


Great!!


This dress is VERY comfortable and it fit well. I wear a 14/16 and an XL fit well. I will likely buy the same dress in another color!


I love the style and the print.  The fit is somewhat tight in the bodice.  No care instructions in the dress either. Overall a cute dress.


It's super cute and I love the comfort of the dress. It is a little see through.  You can see my tattoos tgrouch the dress on my hip


I ordered a XX...normally I wear a large.


I love the dress fit perfect usually I use 12-14 and I bought XL, perfect fit I love it!! I received my order too early in 3 days, very soon..
