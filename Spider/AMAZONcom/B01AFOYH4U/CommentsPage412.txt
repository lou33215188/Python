Very lovely


Had it hemed,because I'm 4'11.  Other than that,outstanding get dress,seamstress even complimented me.


Could not give zero. Size is incorrect


This was a gorgeous dress. Material was plain and simple and the shape was great--it was just one size too big. Exchanged it for a smaller size and will update once I receive it!


I like the dress, it would fit better in the stretchy material.


Cutest most comfy dress ever! Bought this for a fun photo shoot-love the style and I can also wear it to work.


I felt amazing in this dress! It fit perfectly! Yes, I was hosting an event and all eyes were truly on me! :) Thanks...


This is not a large. It's more like a small or medium. Wrinkles easy. Regret buying it.


Fit smaller then size indicated


WAY smaller than size chart!
