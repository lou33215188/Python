love them both. Would oder again.


Love it! Fits wonderfully


Love thedress.  It does fit true to size, but would have been able to fit into a Large as well.  The dress was super comfortable.  Would buy this dress again in another color!


Lovely dress. Fits well.  I am very pleased with my purchase.


love the dress for the price the size chart is accurate.


Perfect dress


I ordered this for a wedding and it was exactly what I ordered. The sash was perfect and will be used for a different dress I have to wear next year. I'm excited to wear my dress and show it off!


Omg so beautiful! I'm a size youth 11. Waist is 30 I got a large and it fit perfect material is well made with the right amount of wiggle room. Highly recommended


Because I love a full-skirt dress, I'm giving this 4-stars but the sizing is off.  The material is cotton which also contributes to rating in my case, since I don't wear polyester as a rule.  I highly recommend sizing up.


Fits perfectly good quality!
