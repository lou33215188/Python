I ordered the purple one. The colour, the fabric and the fit are just perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. One week later I found myelf ordering 3 more of these beautiful dresses. Love everything about it


For the price and the quality of the dress, it was absolutely perfect.  The fit was a litle big, but I choose it that way, so that it can be altered.


Ordered according to the size chart, but the bust area is very large.


Absolutely love this dress! Fit exactly as expected and very good quality. Will be ordering from them again. Great customer service! (I had to return one for ordering the wrong size)


The bust area I couldn't zip dress up. And it was 2/3 inches to short. It was a nice dress, color.


Great dress! I picked the turquoise color in my regular size. The dress fit perfectly (my breast were slightly squeezed in, but didn't feel uncomfortable). I'm 5.6 ish and a size 6-8. I ordered size 8, because I know of my - let's call it "breast issue". The fabric is very soft, and very flattering. The dress is slightly long, so if you don't want to wear high heels, you might have to adjust it a bit (I wore 3-ish" heels).


I wore the dress to a ball and a wedding, and everybody complimented me on it, and asked me where I got it from!


Buy this dress if you want to make an impression! Great buy, for an amazing price!


Love this dress! Bought it for a charity ball and it worked really well as I was also 4 months pregnant! :)


It's so beautiful and has a perfect fit.  The fabric feels great and it flows so well when moving or dancing.


Beautiful dress! Love the color and happy with the material! Very pleased with my purchase!


The material was so sheer that an additional layer would need to be added in from a seamstress to make it wearable. The top portion was so large as to make it seem like an plus size had been ordered.
