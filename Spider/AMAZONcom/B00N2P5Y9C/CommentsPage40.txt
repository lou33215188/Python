I am a 5" 7 and 150 lbs and I read the reviews before I ordered that dress, I chose the size 8 and it fits well. Good quality, the length is just fine. Thank you


Dress looked exactly like it did in the picture! This was a great value, quality exceeded my expectations given the price.


The dress size was a bit small even though I went my the size chart. But the material is nice and I am very satisfied.


I bought this dress in the vermillion red for my cousin's wedding - using the size chart provided. This dress is BEAUTIFUL!!!


it flows perfectly, the material of both the out and inner layers are soft and easy to handle. I'm 5' 6" and I ordered the size 10...its slightly large on the bust, but that's an easy fix. the length is perfect if wearing high shoes. Shipping was a breeze and it arrived in no time flat...It came in a small package, crumpled but an easy steam took care of that.


what an elegant, beautiful piece...I just may order this dress in another colour...


The brand Ever Pretty is now my favourite!!!!


I loved the dress but it was too small in the bust.  I had to return it because the next size would have been too big.


Fulfilled the expectations I am very glad I purchased this dre


My wife loves it


Fit was perfect! Excellent quality for the price!!!!


I helped my cousin get this dress for her prom. She loved it as soon as it arrived! She loves the material and the color. It fits just as expected.


Was a little long and big for me but a pretty dress
