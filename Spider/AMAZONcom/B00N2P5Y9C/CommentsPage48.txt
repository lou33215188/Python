This dress is amazing, I loved it. I am about 160 pounds, ordered size 10 and fits me perfect.


it is very nice but i thought 4 would fit for me because usually that is my size dresses from store.but i will give this to my sister since she is smaller than me im sure she like this a lot.it is quite long but i can have it adjusted..


I'm a size 12 and ordered 1 size up since it was a side zipper. The dress was too big. When I had it on, it reminded me of a bridesmaid dress rather than a formal gown. I sent it back and am awaiting my refund.
