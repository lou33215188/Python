Due to the size of my breasts, I ordered a size larger then had a little taken in in the mid area...it fit perfect. The dress is beautiful! I got so many compliments all night when I wore it.


The dress wasn't fit perfectly it was to large.


Wonderful dress! Thanks so much!


It fit me to a tee!!! I love this dress!!!


I love this dress it fits perfectly.


I love the dress !  Most definitely worth the money and looks like a much more expensive dress.  Fits perfectly


The dress was beautiful for my daughter but she needed it in a larger size but when I returned it they didn't have it available for exchange.


Loved the dress. Looks great and its awesome for the price its not cheap looking. I would recommend getting it


the fit is small. I got the next size up and it fit perfectly.


The dress fits like a glove and with some heels should be just the right length (I am 5'3). I am pleased, especially with the price!
