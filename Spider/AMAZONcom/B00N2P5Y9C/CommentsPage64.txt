I received so many complaints. I felt like a Queen for the day!!!


The color is not what I expected.  Choosing the size I followed instructions but the dress is too small.


Happens.


This was exactly what I was looking for- I bought this for my informal Las Vegas wedding in July 2013.  It was perfect for the price.


This dress is beautiful but runs a little big!


Color is bright as shown. Size is an  exact fit. Just a beautiful dress. It is exactlyas shown in all ways.


I got a smaller size due to reviews saying it ran bigger, but it actually didn't. Everything fit until I got to my bust area.  Wouldn't zip.


It was just a little big but it's hard to order clothes on line anyways but it fit as the measuring hart said it would.


Very pretty!!  I'm 5'8 it's a little short. So if your taller don't even try it!


Great dress, beautiful color! Fit was exactly what was expected, quick shipping. Will order from this seller in the future.


This dress looks just like the image and fits like a charm. I couldn't be happier with it! I can't wait to show it off at the USMC Birthday Ball this weekend!
