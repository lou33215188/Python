I wore this beautiful dress to a military ball.  It was gorgeous and I felt so beautiful. I would highly recommend this dress


Bought this for my girlfriend - it was a slightly tight at first but then she wore it out. It is really pretty for the price and it's a little "plane", it is a handy dress quick fix to needing a long dress for prom/wedding.


Runs rather long, so heels are a must. Fit is great and built-in bra contours nicely. Beautiful color and quality fabric!


Great value for money. Looks elegant without showing too much skin


Got this dress and was suppressed how light it was.


The material is very flimsy, sheer and almost see through


this requires wearing additional undergarment. Not very good


The fit is great. However I am thinking of returning, because it does not


suit the occasion for which I bought it.


It fit my daughter perfectly based on the measurements online. She looked quite stunning and received many compliments on the dress. It was a perfect dress for the price and style.


I bought these dresses for my mother's bridal party and we loved them. Would recommend.


I got the wrong color and it was really big on me. I'm a size 8 - it felt like a ten. Go one size smaller and don't be mad if you get the wrong color.


Basic white dress. Good quality for price!


I bought the dress for my sister. Perfect fit. She was so happy!
