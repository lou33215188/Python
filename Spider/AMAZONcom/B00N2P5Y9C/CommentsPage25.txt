Fits weird on the chest, way to big for me,  buth in size 18, I am 38C, have to return it. I used the size chart but something went wrong, Maybe  if I bought a size smaller.


It wasn't to flattering on me but I that's just me! The fit was pretty good it seems to be made well!


The dress fit very small and is made of very cheap material.  I returned it. I guess you get what you pay for.


Fit is perfect. My wife bought this for a wedding... the only thing she (and I) didn't like is the little cape thing that goes over one shoulder. Kind of strange. I think she ended up cutting it off if memory serves. Other than that it's a very nice, reasonably priced dress.


good material true to color turned out well we added a sparkly pin to the center of the chest and shoulder


This was a great buy. Iâ€™ve bought other dresses in this price range that are no where near the quality of this one. Fits well


Absolutely perfect. Fit and color exactly like a Vera Wang Bridesmaid  gown.  -Bust and rib cage area are the important part for measuring, there is a little bit of stretch to the chest area.


Absolutely perfect! Other Ever Pretty don't have the stretch lining in the skirt but this did and made it #1 in my book. So many compliments on how I looked. Love it.


Beautiful dress...just as I had expected it to be.  I ordered it too big; thinking I would take it in for adjustments at a local seamstress.  $125 altering cost for a $59 dress was just not something I was willing to do.  I pinned it on the sides since the bust area was where it was big.  It seamed to work.  The dress came quickly but was shipped in a plastic bag and was in dire need for a steaming so allow time for that if you order.  I would definitely order from this shipper again!


this dress was beautigul and elegant loved it
