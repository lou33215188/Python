Love the dress. Got a large. Fit perfectly. It was only a little to big in the chest area but I pinned it and it worked well. Love the color as well.


I am 5'11" and I read the other reviews before buying this dress, I was disappointed in the length and the zipper felt as though I was going to rip it when I undid it. The material and the actual dress are very pretty though. If you are about 5'8" and wearing no more than a 1 inch heel, this would be a great dress.


The dress arrived on time and looked exactly like the images online. I got rave reviews from everyone, including my husband. The only shortcoming was the bust on that right side would slide down. All evening I had to give a little tug to keep it in place. All in all, it's a keeper.


I do love this dress it was perfect for my stepdaughter and she love it fir perfectly I order a size 4 and it was the perfect length and color


I measured using the charts provided in the thumbnails, and it fit perfectly. I'm also 8 months pregnant (it is very flowly around the tummy area) - so if you are looking for a good maternity dress, this works wonderfully too!


It fit fine, material's OK and actually looks like the picture ... just not what my daughter was looking for in a prom dress.


Very lovely on - I picked Navy Blue and it was perfect.


Ordered a size 14 and it was way to big so I returned it and ordered a 12. With as big as the 14 was there is no reason the 12 shouldn't have fit, but the 12 was very tight. The color was exactly what you see in the picture.


Beautiful dress, made really well. Size up


I did not need any alterations. It is very elegant. I'm 5'11 and the length was perfect for me with short heels (2 in). The quality is just as expected.
