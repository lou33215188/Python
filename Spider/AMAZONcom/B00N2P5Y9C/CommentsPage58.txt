Arrive early, perfect!!


I was a little scared buying an elegant dress online, since fits can sometimes be a little off. But that was not the case. It fit perfect! The color is beautiful, it is comfortable.LOVE this dress!


i wore this dress at my bay shower and liked it a lot . Very comfy and beautiful ... but i did receive different style than pictured here/


Dress is very good quality.


Beautiful and fit great. My daughter absolutely loved the dress and can't wait for Prom so she can wear it.


I loved this dress the color was exact it was true to size im 5'7 and the length was just right


Well made and beautiful ballroom design. The flowing scarf is so complimentary. The fit is great and the length is perfect. Highly recommend.


A bit too large, however, arrived early and had enough time to take and get altered.  For the price, a great deal.


The dress is lovely and I received many compliments when I wore it to a recent formal event.  The problem for me is that the length is a little too long for my height.  Overall, the dress was a good value.


I was surprised to like this dress so much because it was so reasonably priced. The quality is good but the fabric wrinkles really bad.
