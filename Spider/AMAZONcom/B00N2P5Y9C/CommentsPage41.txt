This dress arrive in time and it was Amazing!  I love it and Amazon Prime...


I bought this for my girlfriend and it fit perfectly and looks nice too. Everyone loved it! The zipper seems nice and sturdy and the dress feel like it's worth more than it cost.


Beautifu!!!


was to big but had no problem exchanging it


The style


This dress is absolutely beautiful. I am 18 weeks pregnant, it still have a lot more room for my tummy to grow. I choose my size base on the size chart(bust only) I am 35b, i got size6.it fit perfectly. If you have a bigger breast, recommend to order 1 or 2 size up. I am 5.1, the dress is pretty long which is very normal. Best dress buying experience ever!


Pretty, just wasn't for me.


Very nice quality, especially for the price. I am very picky about fabric, and this really is a decent gown which I wore to an evening wedding in October. The fit is also extremely flattering on a curvy body type.


The dress fits well without any alterations.  It's very pretty but plain at the same time.  It needs some bold earrings to spice it up.


Beautiful dress had to have it hemmed but it fit perfect.
