I read the reviews and ordered the size by recommendation. This is the first time a dress I have ordered on line fit perfectly. The cloth and quality stitching makes this dress a winner I bought. It for a Cruise and am very excited to show off!


beautiful dress for the money but runs rather large, 


I really love this dress, fit me perfect, is so beautiful, i never expect it was so perfect, the fabric, the long is perfect with high hills is very well done, las medidas son exactamente como dicen en la descripción asi que no hay perdida! Lo amooooo parece que me hubiera costado 200 o 300 dolares


Looking at it, anyone would believe it costs so much more. Perfect Evening Dress. I will purchase another one of a different colour soon. Strongly recommend this Dress!


Gorgeous color and suitable for concerts, measured and appropriate, comfortable and convenient as expected, I loved this dress.Very simple and smooth


I love the color, length and style plus the fit is exactly what I needed.


This dress is awesome! The size 16 is a little large, but absolutely beautiful!!! The dress is extremely well made. The company is great came right on time and I'm super excited to look amazing for my baby sisters wedding!


The dress was better than I expected for such a low price. Based on previous reviews I ordered a size up and the fit was good.


Very good.


Much appreciated.
