Made for her


Beautiful gown! My daughter looked like the princess that she is!


Stunning


Love the dress.  Fits well and love the color


I think I've purchased one other item of clothing online before this dress and i am so expressed I just may start buying more often!! This dress fits just the way I had hoped it would! It's long and flowing and I will look stunning in my sisters wedding! So worth every penny!!


This dress is very beautiful and well made. The color is more of a blue purple.


This is a lovely,well-made dress. The material was very good quality but had to be returned because it was too small in the bust. Most women  would probably fit it but this girl  is overly endowed and needed more coverage.


I loved this dress. I wore it for a wedding I purchased it in black. I got a ton of nice compliments. It was great quality for the price. If you are big breasted try going up one size


This was perfect for what I needed it for. Size was accurate, and fit nicely. Looked good. It's not fancy, but since I needed it quickly and the price was right it definitely worked. Great color (green) and got lots of compliments....
