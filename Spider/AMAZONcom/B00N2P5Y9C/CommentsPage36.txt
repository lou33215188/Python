I would like to personally thank Rosemarie and everyone else involved in my recent purchasing experience.


I ordered a size larger for my bridesmaid who has a large chest but is otherwise a size 6. Got an 8 and it is falling off of her. Thankfully I know how to do alterations or else I'd have to return it.


Just order the size that you would normally guess, don't leave allowance for extra room.


Gorgeous dress!


This is one of the best purchases I've ever made . The price was terrific and fits beautifully ! The material is high quality and overall I'm so happy with this piece !


I had so many great compliments, it was perfect. Can't wait to wear it again.


Very nice dress


I like the dress very much. It fit me perfect,  but it was too, too long.


Kinda plan but can be dressed up with right accessories


Beautiful and the color green amazing!


I ordered a size 6 - I'm 5'2" and I weigh 120 lbs. It fit perfectly but I had a bit of trouble with the zipper -- and so I contacted Ever Pretty and they went out of their way to get me a size 8. Which now is a tad loose, but then, I think long run that's way better than having a zipper issue. It's also VERY long so I will need to have it altered and I will need great heels --- but it looks so expensive and I would buy this again in a heartbeat. It looks like it's worth WAY more than what I spent on it.
