I looooove this dress!! The quality is great and it fits like a glove. I got a size 8 and I am 5 7" at 132 lbs. I was worried about the length but it is plenty long to wear with high heals. It looks just like it does in the picture. The price is a steal too. Buy, buy, buy!


Great quality for the price!  Wore it to my firm party -- it was a little loose, but that just meant it was more comfortable.  I usually wear a 12-14 at 5'3" and 200 lb.  It's very long, so I hemmed it myself.


Loooove this dress. Fit is great except that it’s too long. I’m 5’5”, 120 lbs, ordered a SMALL. I’ll need to get it hemmed up a bit (even with heels). Otherwise I love it. Seems like good quality for the price.


This dress was very elegant. It well with the event I attended. Beautiful gown. Thank you agaim


I love my dress I'm 5'2 and it was extremely long on me even with heels so I got it taken up a bit and wore it to a ball and got so many compliments.  I glad I made this purchase.


I got this in two colors. The white was too see through and therefore, not as flattering.


Gorgeous dress. I'm 5'11 and ordered a small it was too short. I wanted a longer dress so I could wear at least three to 4 inch heels with it.


Beautiful beautiful dress! Well made! The fit is awesome! Material is beautiful and it is also very comfortable. I look forward to wearing this to my husband's Christmas party! The price you just can't beat. Very happy customer.


I love everything about this dress. I wish I could wear it at least once a week. I looked like the black Jessica Rabbit. I am 5"10 290lbs and it fit perfect. I just had to take the seam out a bit to make it longer but other than that I loved it.


Absolutely gorgeous , arrived fast and when I tried it on I was stunned and how beautiful this dress truly is. Classy and elegant, not flimsy or cheap. Excellent quality !
