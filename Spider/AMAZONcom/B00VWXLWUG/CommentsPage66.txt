This dress stretches to fit, I recommend ordering a size smaller than you think. It's extremely long - you will need this taken up unless you're 6'4".


Purchased this for my destination wedding. It is a thick material in that it isn't transparent, but it's not heavy. It has stretch to it so it works for my hips. I'm 5'6" and it's about 6" too long but I expected that. I'm 165lbs and curvy and ordered the XL. Will post a picture after the wedding!


It's beautiful  and the price is amazing


Not bad at all it was a bit big under the arms and by the waist area nothing too drastic that couldn't be altered, if I had ordered a size down then it probably would have been too small... I'm wore it to my cousin's wedding with a brooch as some other customers did...ğŸ˜€


Good for the price. Fits true to size I am 5' 9.5" and wear size 2-4. The stretch in the fabric helps with the fit. It's a shiny satiny material that shows everything!!! I returned mine because it did look a little inexpensive and it wasn't long enough to wear with heels. I would need flats for it to touch the floor. But the style is beautiful and it was well made and shipping was fast.


I absolutely loved this dress!  I bought the black lace and it was very comfortable.  That being said, it was very long so you will probably have to get it hemmed and the neck line in the front was a little awkward.  My seamstress hemmed it and put a few stitches in the front on the neckline so it would lay nicer.  I love the idea of putting a broach on the side like some ladies did!  I felt smoking hot when I wore this dress and would buy it again!


I have to say that I was nervous to order a gown, online and for the inexpensive price.  When I received the gown the quality of the fabric was perfect. The fit was perfect and it had stretch (I actually could have ordered a size down) but it fit well!  I reviewed many of the reviews before purchasing and the picture helped me with adding a brouche to add some glitz to it.  I would definitely recommend this to others!


This dress is everything... Im about 5'4  150 pounds I brought a medium and it fits perfect with just enough room to dance...


Beautiful dress!! I ordered this in burgundy, and I received so many compliments when I wore this dress!! I am 5'8" and wear a size 10 and the large fit perfect! The material is stretchy and very comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this dress on and how elegant it looked. Very happy with this purchase!


I loved this dress!!! I got so many compliments. Iâ€™m weight 200 and I got it in a xl. The material is so stretchy I had to get 3inches of it taken in.  I could have pulled off wearing a medium or large the way the material is which was thick an solid. I would definitely recommend this dress
