Beautiful dress. Bought this for my younger sister who is 4'11 so as expected it was too long and we had it altered.


this dress is so cute and nice! the price is spectacular!


Love this dress. I wore it the Dallas Margarita Ball this year and it fit amazingly. It cinches and sucks you in at the waist and it was more than what I expected for the price. Great material!


I loved the way this dress looked, beautiful dress, great quality. The only reason I took off a star was it was too long. For reference I am 5’2”


Felt like a cheap material, cheap design and the front did not look very pretty... not worth wearing to a legit event, however I'll keep it incase I need a costume for next Halloween.


Seriously great material & style for the price!  I would highly recommend.


This dress is beautiful, I received so many compliments on it wearing it to my friends wedding.


I actually rented a designer gown for the wedding and also purchased this as an option and this looked so much better on me!


Love this dress! I ordered it for an arts gala and it looked great! I'm a full figured gal and it fit great- and very flattering! It was long and I probably should have had it hemmed but I just held it up like a princess as needed.


Looks way more expensive than it is.  Wine color is STUNNING.  Invest in proper undergarments; this dress clings.  Neckline can be worn three ways.  GREAT dress.


Great dress for the price. Material is a little cheap--very similar to Lycra dancewear, but hangs well and looks great in photos. Fit as described on site. Very comfortable. Blue was a bit more cerulean in-person as opposed to the true blue as appears online.
