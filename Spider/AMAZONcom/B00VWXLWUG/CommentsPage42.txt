The product was perfect I am so disappointed it accidentally ordered the wrong color and they are out of the color I need. So very disappointed! Would have loved to own this dress. <\3


This dress was a surprisingly good purchase. I ordered via the size guide and the dress fits well. I am 5'10" and usually wear a size 2 (32-24-36). It is quite long, so you will need to either have it shortened or wear high heels as I did or you will have TOO long of a train. I think anyone shorter than 5'8" should expect to have it shortened. I purchased mine in white and needed to wear white stockings with a panty panel, as it is too sheer for colored under garments and you cannot wear underwear at all as it will show a panty line. The back line is too low for a bra, so I went without and the extra fabric at the neck kept me modest. My one complaint with this dress is how easily the fabric snag. It is very comfortable and stretchy, but the slightest thing can snag it. One wear and mine already has snags and I am very careful with my things!


The dress fit true to form unfortunately the color was more of an off-white versus white. Wasn't able to use it for the event I purchased it for but I do intend to wear it for something else.


Stunning!!!!!


Loved it!  Was able to wear a 4" heal and get away with the length.  Received many comments.


Loved this dress for a wedding- quality material , great price


Love love love. I'm tall almost 6 foot. This dress fit perfect ! I decided to wear the sleeves on my shoulders for a different look. The fabric is great. It doesn't feel cheap like a costume.


Great dress. Looks great one. Will purchase again


It is too small but it is very pretty and the material is good quality.  And it arrived in two days as promised. Mywedding is a year away hopefully I will lose the weight and it will fit as I hope.


Loved this dress!! The color was gorgeous and the fabric had a nice stretch to it!
