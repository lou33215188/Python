Dress is lovely. Fits great and it's very comfortable. I was expecting it to be an emerald green like the picture. It's more of a hunter green. Dark. It's still pretty but I wanted the lighter green. Anyway. I got the XL. I'm 5'9. 190. 38DD. Perfect fit. It's stretchy so it'll be good for bigger hips or boobs.


Very flattering!  You don't even have to hem it, if it is too long, because you can just hike it up around your waist and hips and kind of gather it.  With the gathers it is even flattering on bigger bellies.  I bought 8 of them for our hula dancers who range from 4'9" to about 6 feet.  It is very showy and flattering too all heights and weights.  Amazing.


Absolutely gorgeous dress! I received so many compliments on this dress! It looks expensive! Iâ€™m 5â€™3, I did have to hem it by about 4 inches, if youâ€™re taller, the length would be perfect! I ordered a small, fits pretty true to size. It does have some stretch to it, hugs your curves! Love it!


Love this dress! It's going to be perfect for the 1930s theme wedding I'm attending. I'm only 5'1 so it's crazy long, but everything is. Very true to size. Has a little give and it's a thicker satin so it doesn't show every line and wrinkle from your body. Couldn't be happier :)


I am 5 4, 140 lb and I ordered a medium. This fit me perfectly. I ordered the green and it is more of a emerald green. Beautiful color. Very comfortable to wear. The fit was very flattering.


Absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Thereâ€™s a lot of stretch in the dress but I would order one size up. Iâ€™m 5â€™3â€� 38 H and size 10/12. The dress is a little long but once I put on my 4 inch heels it wasnâ€™t as noticeable. Received LOTS of compliments! The only problem is the front left breast looked â€œwornâ€� by the end of the night. I donâ€™t know if my bracelet was rubbing against it or there was someone else going on with the fabric. HOWEVER I would purchase the dress again ğŸ˜�


Fit perfectly.  Was stretchy enough to dance all night long.  Got a ton of compliments.  Highly recommend.


Beautiful color and fit but the fabric snagged easily so unfortunately I won't be able to wear it again.  But it was a beautiful choice at a great price for the event


I loved this dress absolutely stunning. Felt like I was walking the red carpet. Very comfortable was able to move and dance all night.


I saw this dress at this price and just had to get it.  So glad I did! I ordered a medium because the other dress I got from muxxn (cap shoulder swing dress) fit just fine that size although my measurements (38 27 37) made me consider a large. This dress fits but TIGHT.  There's  obviously decent stretch but it's not too tight, chest isn't smooshed, very flattering. Just makes  me wonder what the the large might look like. Just a little worried as the zipper doesn't appear the best quality and I'd hate for it to split. Haven't worn it out yet as it needs to be hemmed  I'm short at 5'4". Gorgeous, head turning dress.
