Do it. Buy this dress. You will not be disappointed. It is beautiful. We got the white one as per my daughters' schools' prom tradition. She looks amazing. Like Veronica Lake or Jean Harlow.


I wish the description of the dress had said that it had some stretch or contained lycra. I am glad that the dress does have some stretch, hugs me in all the right places, makes me feel sexy and very happy to be a crossdresser. Love the color, the fit , the sheen and the silky softness of the material. Dresses like this make me feel like the woman I always wanted to be.


Beautiful fit! I am size 0, 5'7" and bought the small. I needed this for a black tie event, but didnt want to break the bank for an elegant dress. While the fabric is not luxurious, it is soft and the color is rich. I am very happy with this purchase!


This dress really made my curves look good although I didn't like the neck. The neck area wasn't loose enough but after seeing other reviews it may have looked better pinned up to the side. I'm 5'1 so this dress was really long on me.


Worked really well for an elegant masquerade party I attended.


MUCH better than I even expected! I love it! Excentuates women's curves well.


The dress is true to size! Ordered a small and it fits perfect! I was a little shorter so I have to hem it but great dress! Thick heavy material so all your lines and lumps will not show! Love!


Loved it!!! Fit like a glove. Hid my tummy a little and made me look like I have a butt (but I don't yall). For reference, I'm 5-5, 140 lbs, 34D and ordered a M.


It's really nice quality. I love it.I am short so needed to cut ir and tak in a by but I ordered bigger just incase. I love it


I have tried it on and loved that the material stretched and gave ...I'm a 2x so it was great to know it fit.
