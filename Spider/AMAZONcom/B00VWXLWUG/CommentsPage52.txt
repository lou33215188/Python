I love this dress. Material is amazing. Got so many compliments.


I believe these were some fake reviews on this dress...How is it that my dress was the only one came back messed up. I mean it was nothing like the picture AT ALL!!!!!! It was a short and it had a collar with a rose on it...WT* Look like something the Ushers wear at a church...LAWD somebody burn the manufactory...O I believe they screen shot these pictures...Just ain't noway


I was the hit of the party, everyone LOVED this dress.


The dress fit perfectly and is more beautiful than pictured.


I absolutely love this dress OMG it looks so flattering on my curves. I want it in every other colors now.


I ordered this dress a size bigger because I thought it may run a little small.


Absolutely gorgeous! Fit like a glove but has some stretch. The fabric is so soft and beautiful. Be careful not to sit on anything scratchy. The material can catch easily.


Beautiful elegant dress!!!


Absolutely beautiful


Looked a little too much like a costume and less like a dress.
