A very nice dress. Stretchy material, long for me at 5'7" with an extra of 4" inch heels. Top part of dress little thick for that scrunchy look. Beautiful dress


Beautiful, simple and elegant.


I’m 5’2, 137lb and very busty. Ordered a medium and it is snugs every curve. Fits well but does emphasize chest(might be issue to some) My usual dress size is 6 and usually order between a medium to small.


This was for a Halloween costume and fit entirely too small. I went with a larger size because of some comments but it was still way too small in the next size up.


The fit was great other than its a little long, but I did expect that from other reviews, at the price it worth a little altering... Love the Dress


Such a beautiful dress I was worried it wouldn’t fit Bc my measurements are a little weird but it came and it fits perfectly! It hugs every curve in just the right places. Also super soft and maneuverable. I love love love it!


Love this!!


love it lotts of compliments


The color was very flattering, more for a tall person. I don't hear heels over 2inchs. Can't find my full body shot. But the fit was nice.


This dress is a hugger. But I am surprise at the quality from purchasing from amazon. I got it for a formal event. I will upload pictures the night of event.
