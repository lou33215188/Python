This dress was surprisingly good quality. I'm 5ft and weigh about 115 and the small fit me very well.


I ordered 3 of the same dress same color and they where all different colors I am not happy with this because it will be for my wedding Bridesmaids, now the fabric is perfect and sizes are on point


Perfect fit for any shape and size.


Great dress! It is VERY long. I am 6' and it falls taller than I am. However with high heels 5", it will be at your ankle.


Regardless, the dress is a good classy sexy look!


Beautiful dress, and after a few alterations, it was the perfect wedding dress for me.


On my way out the door a lady stopped me and said “your outfit was the highlight of my evening”. I received compliments in this dress all night! I felt like a million bucks! No ones knows I spent less than $50 on this dress. Get it get it get it <3


Beautiful! But for me even the S size was big... I guess I need a XS. Great quality....!


So gorgeous! Very well made! Heavy high quality fabric,  so pretty! I'm between a 6 and an 8, but larger chest. Ordered a small and it fits like a glove! Well made, smooth seams,  absolutely gorgeous!!!


Love this dress .....when my mom saw it she wanted one. So we ordered two for different functions. oh dress was beautiful, was the bell of the ball. thank you will buy again. two thumbs up


Very nice dress. I am a curvy 5'9, 168lbs and ordered a medium which fits perfect! The dress hugs all my curves and the length is perfect. One little issue though, some of the threading on the dress was sticking out but I just pulled/cut them off.
