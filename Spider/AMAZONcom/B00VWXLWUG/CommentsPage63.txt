Beautiful color and nice stretch to the fabric. I'm 5'4" and 135 lbs. The dress fit great in a medium "around" my body... I could have maybe even fit into a small. The dress is very long however, not just in length of skirt, but the whole torso was made for a very tall person. If you are really tall, it would be a great dress. Although I could have hemmed the bottom of the dress, the whole bodice would have had to been adjusted as well.


I love this dress,fit great but a little  long so u will have to hem it..


I LOVE this dress very nice


Very good fit


Material a bit thin. True to size.


Love this dress!


Not my style...will not wear


The dress is beautiful. The way that the shoulder and cowel neck is styled you can wear it a few different ways. Like another poster, I'm moving the cowel off to the side and the dress is currently with the seamstress. Who noted BTW how beautiful and well made the dress was.


Dimensions: well I'm 5'4 and weigh 145lbs and bought the Medium. Fits perfect.  The length is perfect with my heels.


This dress is extremely long!


Love this dress, got many compliments at the event.  I am 5'6" and ordered the medium; it fit great but I had to hem it one inch shorter- only took me 20 mins to do.


I was very comfortable, moved about easily and ballroom danced all night. Slightly stretchy fabric. I loved wearing a classy subdued color with the burgundy dress - I wasn't 'the woman in red' at a wedding.
