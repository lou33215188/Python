Love this dress. Good quality. I’m 5’10” a size 14 and it was long enough. Wore it New Year’s Eve and got a ton of compliments. Very elegant!


Awesome dress...it shows everything.  Received lots of complements.


This is not even the dress that I recieved. The dress was way too big. I ordered a medium and recieved a XXL.  It had one shoulder not two.it looked like someone patched fabric together and called it a dress. Now I have a week to find a new dress.


I order a large it fit perfectly  everone thought i pay top dollar  for this dress will order aging i reaally wish i cpuld add photo


Definitely shows every nook and cranny. Skin tight fit, I'm 5'9 and it was still long with 4 inch heels. I normally wear a size 18 and ordered a 2x. Any shape wear will show through unless it is the seamless kind. I would have liked a larger size selection but it is definitely worth the buy.


I love this dress! I wore it as my second wedding dress at my reception. It was perfect


Very nice and classy!


beautiful but shows all of your flaws. worked well for a photoshoot


This dress was absolutely awesome! Love it!
