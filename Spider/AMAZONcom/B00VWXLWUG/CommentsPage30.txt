Cute cute cute! Wore this to a black party and everyone was complementing me on how much they love my dress. It is very flattering. I am 5 11' and the fit was just purrfect


Love it. The fit is great!


Amazing dress!  High quality, soft/comfortable fabric, elegant look, fantastic price and fit like a glove!


I am beyond in love with this dress! I purchased this dress for my civil wedding and Its perfect!


I was extremely nervous to buy a dress online but it looks just like the picture. I bout the white lace it looks amazing. It is also stretchy which I love since I am a bit curvy! I got a Small and I am 5'5 136 pounds.


Gorgeous dress when paired with the right jewelry and accesoroes!! Love it will be using quite a bit for special formal occasions.


Real deal look, as long as you do enough gym time.


I didnâ€™t like the color of the white. It looked cheap. The fabric looked more like silver from certain angles. It fits nicely though. I should have gotten a small but I hate things to fit tight on my body.


I bought the blue dress for a formal wedding I am attending. It fit perfectly! I love the fabric, form fitting yet forgiving. This was a perfect dress to dance the night away in.


Did not look good, not like in photo. Weird cowl neck!
