This dress is perfect. I worried it would be too long and need to be hemmed but it doesn't. (With heels at least) i am 5'4" and weigh 113 Ibs. I am a bra size 32DD and filled the small out perfectly. The cowl neck doesn't stay down easily but looks lovely either way. Purchased for military ball!

This dress is beautiful. I actually returned the dark blue one because I wanted it in a brighter color but the fit was amazing and accentuates what little curves I have.


I love the way it fit and received several comments about the dress. My better half really loved the dress.


Beautiful color, the darts are flattering. I'm only 5'4  I expected to hem the dress. Its very comfortable. This is a show stopper, heads will turn.
