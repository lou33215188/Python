Love Love This Dress!!! Fits great !!! Iam 5'5 180 lbs a large fits perfectly!!!


Absolutely gorgeous, just stretchy enough. However, it makes it impossible to wear shapewear as it shows every seam underneath. Had to send otbqck, sadly. But just a gorgeous dress and color.


I just recieved my gown today and tried it on and it looks amazing. Thanks to the ladies pics and recommendations on the gown i ordered the right size and it fits perfect im so pleased. Now i can enjoy my upcoming Gala event in style.


I went to a 40's Old Black Hollywood  themed tea party and I got a lot of praise for my dress, everyone loved it, I'm so happy I got the dress!


Got plenty of compliments on this dress at an event where everyone else was a gazillionaire.


Love this dress!!!!!! I am going to order another in a different color.


If I would have gotten one size bigger it would have been perfect..for the little bit if time I had it on it looked great.


My daughter LIVES this dress. Its a little long we have to get alterations done..but its worth it!!!
