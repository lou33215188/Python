Has nice stretch too it and gives me a great shape. Could have even gone down a size for real va-va-voom. But 5 kids later maybe not - haha. Can't wait to wear it to my cousin's wedding.


Love this dress got it because I am renewing my vows nice material elegant like the way it fits my curves great price for this dress


The dress is flattering and comfortable. It also looks like it costs more than it does. The green was a little bit darker and bluer than the picture, but not enough that it bothered me.


Awesome dress. It fits as expected. I am a 16 and got a XXL. I am so glad I bought it


Beautiful soft, stretchy & sexy. I also purchased in another color as well.


Beautiful dress!  I am highly pleased!  I possibly could’ve ordered a size smaller, but the fit is great and the unlike satin, the fabric stretches.  Looks gorgeous on.


I love the dress I got it in white for my wedding photos but........ it’s very transparent I’m going to need a slip. But I love how it hugs every curve of my body. I’m 5’6 and 112 so I don’t have many curves but the ones I do !!! I love it !


I order this dress is green and it is beautiful!!!!


I have not worn the dress but it fits my curves excellent, not to tight and not to big.


I ordered the same dress in white because the price was right.......


Love this dress!!!


Quality fabric, great design, flattering for a curvy figure.  The color is true and lovely.  The dress is long, I am 5'8" and required 3" heels to lift the bottom of the dress just barely off the floor.


This dress was soo beautiful! It’s pretty long! I ordered it for my mom who is 5’4” and she had 4” heels on and the dress still was slightly on the floor! Very sturdy material!! Dress looks expensive! You can’t beat the price! Very satisfied!
