So Glad I ordered this dress for my engagement party. I created a side split to create the look I was going for. Everyone loved it!!! And I am satisfied!


Wonderful dress for the price. I'm 5'1'' and typically wear a size 6 in dresses, and the size small fit me perfectly. The dress was a little long on me even with 4 inch heals, but I was able to wear it and and walk in it without getting it hemmed.


Very nice dress for the money, fits as expected.


I ordered this for my school’s formal, and it was *absolutely* perfect!! I’m 5’10” & finding a dress that’s truly floor length and looks great is a struggle—this dress did just that!!


The color is as pictured with a nice satin sheen. The material is nice. Doesn't feel cheap at all. Has a good weight to it. The dress fit well. I ordered it a size up because I was nervous about the material but I could have bought it in my regular size (I usually wear a M , size 8 in pants and skirts, 36D ) . Looks great for the price .


Beautiful dress! Wore it to a 1930's themed party. Will wear again for a wedding. Got a million compliments on the dress! Very comfortable and not restricting. Fast delivery and worth every penny!


Love this dress! Stretching material! A little forgiving! Perfect fit!


Super fast delivery. Just Beautiful!


Beautiful dress! Definitely worth it.


Dress is ok. I ordered xxl , fits very close and tight. Very dissapointed.
