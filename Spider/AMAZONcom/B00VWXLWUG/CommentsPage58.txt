Receieved a completely different dress and of low quality.


It came on time, and I was very please with my purchase. I was a bit skeptical at first to order it, but I'm glad I did. Love it! And it fit great!, just was a bit too long though.


Fits great, received a lot of compliment. I am 5 7" and weigh 180 lbs


Nice


Not the item pictured.  The item I recieved is a 1950's style tea length dress with sleaves and a rose on left side.  Not this. Very disappointed


Love how it fits !!!!!!


Obsessed! The fit is amazing!


I fall in love with this dress


Love it. Stretchy fabric. I went a size down and it was perfect!


Yes
