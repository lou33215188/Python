it will work for what I need it for


Such an elegant form fitting dress! NO SLIP REQUIRED.


A bit tricky to get into if you aren't on the willowy side, but it's very pretty!


Wow! Fits like a dream! Dress is made from a great fabric, fit is very flattering, is somewhat strechy and forgiving. Very long, and will need hemming, but no big deal. Great dress!


It fits good. I am 5'10 and i tried with high heels, it was still long enough to cover the shoes.


The dress exceeded my expectations can't wait to wear it to my event.


Beautiful dress; neckline was awkward on me, but probably due to my large bustline.  I would recommend dress for smaller bustlines.


Absolutely beautiful dress.  Good material.


So in love with this dress!!! Using as my reception dress...I want one in every color!!


I love the dress the color is beautiful  . It fits  gresst
