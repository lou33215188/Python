I ordered a small and it fit like a glove, I am 5'5 and about 125lbs. It is really such a beautiful dress and I am extremely excited to wear it.


I absolutely love this dress! I was worried, being tall, that it would be too short. I am 5'9", 36B, and weigh about 136-- the medium fit like a glove! Be aware that it doesn't hide things, so size up if you don't want it snug. The length hit the floor and then some, it was just like the photo.


I love this dress! I bought for a Christmas debutante ball. The material is nice and somewhat stretchy. It has the right amount of cling. I love the look of old Hollywood glam! I did have to take it to get it altered since it was a tad too long but I am also short. Throughly happy with my purchase!


Haven't worn it out yet, but very pleased with dress. Fits perfectly and comfortably and looks exactly like advertised. Was very nervous ordering online and so excited that it came exactly as shown. Can't wait to wear next weekend.


PERFECT For my wedding. had Swarovski crystals added to it! BEAUTIFUL! Needed to take it in a LITTLE bit, but otherwise, fits great!


and it's well made too.


I never write reviews!! But seriously I just had to. ITS SOOO BEAUTIFUL! I cant get over the price!! I wish I would have found this before I had my bridesmaids buy those expensive DAVIDS BRIDAL GOWNS!!


The dress is beautifully cut and well sewn. However, after wearing it one time, the fabric started to pill. So depressing.


Was more substantial than we expected. Worn as a wedding gown and received MANY compliments! Great value!


Fit well and great for the price. The lining around the neck say oddly across the bust  though which was pretty visible.


Beautiful dress! I'm 5'8 and it was long enough to where it covered my feet! That's hard to find sometimes. Totally satisfied!
