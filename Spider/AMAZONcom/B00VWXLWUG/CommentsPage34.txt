The model wearing this liked it very much.  Just slightly tight for her, but very workable.


Very beautiful dress for the price, has the satin look but is also stretchy.


Amazing! Loved everything about this dress. Great quality and fir as expected


I ordered a Small and it was much too big. I am 5'4 and 125 lbs. Had to return. Beautiful dress though!


Love the style and the material!


It hugged my body perfectly! The color came as show and the length as well. And for the first time delivered on schedule! Thanks!


Wow, The fit is perfect, form fitting without being trashy.  I'm tall 5 ft 9 in and with heels its fine. If flows so nicely when I walk.


Loved everything about this dress.


It's GORGEOUS. This little shop has become my favorite place to order dresses! So classy and flattering!


Very happy! Ordered size larger in case, glad I did but would have been ok either way. Very comfortable, beautiful fabric and perfect length. Highly recommend. Fabric is very nice- not just for prove but for a dress twice the price. Very happy!
