This dress is perfect! I was nervous that it would be too small but it was a perfect fit. Purchased an XL only because I'm very top heavy. It has some stretch to it so it hugs every curve on my body! Definitely recommend this dress especially for the price!


The quality of this dress is fantastic. It is very long and I had to have it cut and hemmed even if I wanted to wear 4" heels. It is thick and hugging in all the right places and the stretch gives you smooth shape.


It sits a bit weird on the chest area. Material is nice though.  Fits as expected


Fits like a glove! It is quite long. I"m 5'6" and in 4" heels the hem is just skimming the ground. It's extremely flattering on my big hips. I look 6' tall!


The color and fit


Great dress!!


This dress fits me very well. I recommend a size up if  you purchase. I can’t wait to wear it for my event


I love the dresses. The two on the end came from amazon. I really like the fact it was long enough. My daughters are 5’10. The length was perfect!


I love this dress on me.


Loved it. It was a hit for a simple black dress
