I am 5 "1 and 136lb I order my dress in a small and it is beautiful hugs all the right places it has a good stretch will order again


This dress is SO nice! I was completely blown away by the quality of this! I wore it to a banquet & got TONS of compliments! HIGHLY recommend.


I absolutely love this dress!originally bought for our anniversary to cicada club,instead was used for pin up prom. It does come a bit big, could have gotten a large instead of xl.


I have 3... thatâ€™s all


OMG, this dress is simply amazing and with a broach it's a million bucks!


Fits almost true to size.. If your in between sizes (ie small-medium) but think you might need to go with medium out of far of the small being to small.. you might wanna go with the small. The dress has a good stretch to it but at the same time the medium was "too big".


Ever lump or line shows.


Great buy, the material allows room to breath. Was perfect for the Mardi Gras Ball I attended....


My daughter wore this for homecoming court!  It's beautiful and fit perfect.  She's 5'7 120lbs.


I was hesitant about getting a dress for my firm's 20th Anniversary party from Amazon but decided to try it.  It arrived promptly and fit like a glove.  I could have gone a size down but I wanted to be comfortable throughout the evening.  Such a great price and all I had to do was pay to have the dress hemmed.  I am 5'1" so it was extremely long but I already expected as much.  The fabric was heavy and beautiful.  Not cheap or flimsy at all.  Got compliments all night long on my dress!
