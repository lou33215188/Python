BEAUTIFUL FLAWLESS


This dress at stunning.  I bought it in black, looked very expensive, and so comfortable.  I am 5 7  148 lb I bought a small and it fit perfectly. I am ordering an another color.


Green was not like I expected. Here it looks true green. But when I got it, it looked more of a peacock turquoise color. Didn't work for what I needed.


This dress was everything & more ;). Perfect fit. It hugs your curves w/ out being overly sexy. I ordered a Medium I'm 5'3 125lbs. I have a curvy athletic build. Purchased this outfit last minute w/ my own $, my review is not tainted by the seller b/c I found & purchased this outfit on my own. I hope this helps.


Best ever. Great dress. beautiful. Unbelievable price. Amazing. Will probably be buying other colors.


The dress is comfortable and fit fine.  Cut long, which is nice for tall girls and easily altered for shorter girls.  The style is a little strange and not very flattering for curvy girls.  The dye rubbed off on my daughter's gel nails, so caution should be exercised or maybe try cleaning before wearning to set dye.  Won't use the dress again, but not bad for the money.


The dress arrived on time. I wore this dress to my sorority ball, and I received numerous compliments.


LOVED THIS DRESS!!! Just needed to be hemmed, but I'm short.... so no big surprise there.


love the dress, but it is way too long!


Dress is very pretty and well made, but it arrived with a stain on the bodice of it. Photo is straight out of the bag.
