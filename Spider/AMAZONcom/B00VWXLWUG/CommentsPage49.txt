Dress fits awesome, but the zipper is CHEAP, it broke the first time I tried zipping it up.  Will be returning this item.


Sexy with stretch, great for evening out


It's a beautiful dress but very large. I have to do cut a little bit


Such a great dress for the money! It fits perfectly and feels great on.  Can't wait to wear it!


Beautiful dress had to return because it just didn't flatter me.


I loved it. The material is soft. I even bought my sister one


Love the dress! (Especially for the price!) Fit nice, a little snug around the hips.  I am 5'10 and 140 lbs, purchased a medium.


Everything could have came a little bit longer but it's fine


I love this dress it looks just as the picture. You wouldn’t make a mistake buying this item.


Good material. Well made. A bit long but was not hard to helm. I’m 5’4, 190 and XL fits nice and neat.
