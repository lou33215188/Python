Good material! Great buy!


I got so many compliments on this dress. People thought it cost a fortune. It fit like a glove. Beautiful fabric on


Just love love love this dress


This material is so soft and it has nice stretch!! I wore it to an art show date.


I loved this dress it was a perfect fit


Amazing dress!!!!! The length was long which is perfect for me. I was able to wear five inch heals. Truly a stunning dress.


Beautiful just a pictured. Fabric is comfortable and matches my wedding colors perfectly


Love it! You know what I loathe? When I buy a form-fitting dress to impress, and instead, the fabric is cheap, thin, and shows EVERY bump, rather than the ones we prefer. This is not that dress.


The dress is reminiscent of gowns I've purchased for hundreds of dollars in the past..absolute same quality. Lots of stretch to this fabric. I am a mere 5'2", so yes, even with 5 inch heels, I will need to alter in length.


If you plan to wear this to an event and are less than 5'6" without heels, please leave time to alter...but rest in peace knowing the dress will look like you paid 10 x's the price and hug every curve!


This dress was elegant. I got a lot of complements on it. You will not regret buying this.


Good buy
