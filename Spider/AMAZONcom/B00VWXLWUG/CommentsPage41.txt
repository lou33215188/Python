This dress is awesome! I chose this dress for my bridesmaids and everyone loved it! Not to mention a great price. My girls are all different sizes and it looks good on everyone of them. Super stretchy and comfortable. Definitely recommend this classy well fit dress!!


Very poor quality material, it gets damaged very easily. I wore it for a formal event, and I could not wear this again. Went straight into the trash. Don't waste your money buying it.


Beautiful dress! Very flattering!  Iï¸� am 5â€™8 and 170 pounds. Bought the large.


The dress did not have the gold color as pictured. It was mostly black. Ordered a medium per size instructions and was too small and WAY too long. The material was stretchy however I will be sending this back.


looked great but had to return it because it was too large. The material felt great too


Love it!! Great material.. great price and fit me perfectly! Iâ€™m 5â€™4 182pds. I ordered a XL and thought it would be too big but fit perfectly. I definitely will be using them again


Fitted good and I loved the way I looked would recommend it to everyone. I looked soo stunning.


I loved the dress I stay to my size as I ordered it perfect for the prom night!  ğŸ˜»


Really flattering & great fit


The material was nice but there is no shape to this dress, if you have a tummy at all stay far away.
