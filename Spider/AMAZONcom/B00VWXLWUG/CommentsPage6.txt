the most beautiful dress that i consider using for my bridesmaids in the future. It honestly hugs your curves in all the right ways. don't wear any bulking undergarments because they will be seen through the gorgeous silky dress. I am using this dress for my Renaissance Faire angel costume. I bought size s, i am 5'1" in height, my bust is 34"inches, waist is 25"inches, and my hips are 34"inches as well. it is a little long but nothing i can't hem. seriously buy this dress you won't stop loving it!!!


THIS GOWN IS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!


I cannot believe how beautiful & elegant this gown is. Iâ€™ve had a Butterickâ€™s 1920s pattern of this exact gown for 15 years that Iâ€™ve been wanting to make. Buying this gown is so much easier. Lol


The material is not super thin but stretchy. This allows the gown to show off curves but might also reveal undergarments. In my pics Iâ€™m wearing a thong & my trusty Tidetell bra (unhooked- I just use it to lift those girls up & cover up any signs of chilly nipples!) This bra can be found on Amazon BTW. ğŸ˜‰


I ordered a large. Iâ€™m 5â€™9â€�, 155 lbs (38â€�,34â€�,41â€�) & wear a M/L or US size 10. Iâ€™m only wearing my 2 inch heels, which is good for me because I hate wearing anything higher- kills my back. These pics were taken right after I took the dress out of the package- it needs to be ironed. The neckline needs to relax as well- it doesnâ€™t want to lay right at the moment. Such a beautiful great buy!


Holy crap, stunning! I'm short (5 feet tall) and this was pretty long on me, but it stretched to fit my curves, so I just wore very high heels with it! I used it for an evening gown Lady Loki cosplay and paired it with a black underbust corset and gold belt!


The dress is beautiful!!!!! The material is of very good quality. I'm a large, but a medium would have fitted just fine. A must buy!


Fantastic dress. Fit exactly how it was supposed to. I wore it to a wedding and got compliments all night. I felt very beautiful and elegant all night and comfortable. The fabric is stretchy so you will be very comfortable. I would totally buy it again.


This dress is gorgeous! The material is a really nice quality and has stretch to it so it's very forgiving. I got a size a bit larger as I have a muffin top I'm trying to hide so the dress was pretty long because of this. I'm not sure if I would have ordered the smaller size if the length would have been any shorter. I got a large and here are my measurements so you can compare: height 5'4" weight, 140, 36C-30-36. Worst case scenario is that you'll have to hem the bottom. Other than that, it is really gorgeous and looks like a far more expensive dress.


This dress was everything.  It arrived packaged nicely.  I'm short (4'11), so with everything I buy, if it's long, it has to be altered, but the length of this dress was decent with heels.  If i had more time, I probably would have had it hemmed so it wouldn't have gotten so dirty on the bottom by the end of the night.  However; it washes well too!  My dress was black on the bottom by the end of the night, but even when I washed it, came out sparkling white again.  I received lots of compliments.  After reading the other reviews, I bought a large and it fit perfect over my butt and hips.  I'm on the right.  Great dress for the price!


Love the dress! You can't beat the price for an evening gown. However it does show allllll of your flaws/curves. I put a corset under it to reign in my post baby tummy flub. So you can see all the ruffles on the corset in my picture. I need to buy a smooth corset instead. The green color is a true emerald color which is why I bought it. I am 5' tall wearing 5" heels. The hem on the small still touches the floor but it won't trip me I think.


Gorgeous gown! Hugged every curve appropriately and I got a ton of compliments. Of course it was too long so I had to have the length altered (I'm only 5'2).


I needed a dress for a masquerade party...I wanted classy, sexy, and unique to my style....and this was all of that..I did size up a bit to ensure that it is not too clingy due to the material..I am a 6/8 and ordered a large..probably could have fitted the medium, but it wasn't necessary....I did put a beautiful vintage brooch on one side of the strap and wore it off the shoulder...it is really stunning...I got the burgundy..I originallt wanted red, but its so rich and pretty I love it even more that I would have the red...I want it in every color...buy it:)
