After searching for weeks, and after trying on so, So, SO many different styles of dresses, and dresses costing from $50 - $300, with most costing around $150! Then I come here on Amazon, and I finally find "THE DRESS" I'm wearing to my daughter's wedding, and "THE DRESS" only costs $39.99! THAT'S CRAZY!


This dress fits me perfectly, & without feeling too tight anywhere. Even if I were to gain 10 pounds, I think it would still fit me just fine, because the fabric is very forgiving and quite flattering even at 54 years of age. The only alterations I'll need are about an inch taken off the lengnth, so I won't be tripping on the front of the dress. The only challenge with this dress is the cowl neckline, I'm going to have to put a few stiches in it to keep it folded right. I'm 5'4 & 1/2" tall, I usually wear a US size 8 in dresses, & I weigh between 143-150 lbs (don't weigh myself). Measurements: chest 38.5", waist 29", hips 39", & I'm very happy with this purchase! (Oh, I'm also not wearing a bra or any supportive under garments in this photo, so the dress can only look better when I am.)


â˜†Update: I had initially purchased this dress in a size medium, but the more I thought about it, I really didn't like way the cowl neck looked, so the more I thought I should see if a size large dress would fit any better. Well, the large dress fits just as nicely as the medium does, but now there's enough fabric in the front, and the cowl neck hangs in a soft fold as it should.


I love this dress. I read all of the reviews before purchasing to make sure I got the right size. I am 5'9" I have 34D chest and 44" Hips :(


I got the XL. The material is amazing, stretchy, but not clingy. I got this dress for my wedding. I made a few modifications to make it more custom. Like the other ladies who purchased the dress, I wasn't so fond of the cowl neck, but didn't like it to the side either. My tailor cinched it in the middle and we added some lace for a "train". I hope you all love the dress as much as I do.


I loved this dress. It looked elegant, not cheap, and is a stretch satin material. The dress is very flattering when sized correctly. I think this dress would look good on any body type!


I ordered it in 2 sizes because I wasn't sure if I'd best fit into a M or a L. My measurements are 36-30-45. The L was baggy and unflattering. The M hugged my curves beautifully and had enough give to allow me to dance in the dress without feeling restricted. I'm only 5'4 and the dress was floor length even with the heels I wore. I did not get it altered though. I liked the look of it hitting the floor. However, if you are short like me and this is an issue for you, I advise getting the dress hemmed.


I wore this dress with silver shoes, a matching silver clutch and silver accessories (although the bracelet I wore was on the opposite wrist than is showing in the picture).


I wore this to my boyfriend's military ball and it was perfect! It fit so well, and hugged all the right curves. I have never felt so sexy yet so comfortable in a dress before. It is definitely a showstopper! I am 5'7 and ordered a size medium. The length was perfect and with heels, I didn't have to get it hemmed. 10/10 would recommend!!


I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! I felt like the belle of the ball at a recent Harlem Nights Party. I originally bought this dress in an XL but it was a tad too snug, so I returned it for the XXL. (The return process was a breeze!) Iâ€™m 5â€™8â€� and 225lbs. The length of the dress just brushed the floor when paired with 3.25â€� heel shoes. The material is very forgiving while it hugged my curves. I also loved that I could pinch the fabric to add my motherâ€™s old peacock broach without actually piercing the fabric. The color perfectly complimented my peacock hair pin. I received so many compliments that night. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRESS!!!


OMG this dress is amazingggggggg. I thought i was take a chance at this price but its a great fit and looks stunning. I cant wait to wear it with full shoes and accessories. I am usually a 12 or 14 and 5'8". I ordered an XXL and it fits perfect.


It exceeded my expectations. I am abt 5'3 abt 185 lbs. I ordered according to my measurements. I was planning to hv my dress tailored. When i received the dress it was very long especially in the torso region. My tailor shortened the waist. The neckline was altered and the slits are a little added flava for my bday. Will buy in other colors.


I loved it. It was perfect for my party. Exactly the look I was going for.


Perfect dress for engagement announcement!â�¤ 5 stars. On time, perfect size, perfect price, perfect material.


Gorgeous!  Don't hesitate and order this dress ğŸ¤—The material is both silky and  tad stretchy which I like. I'm 5'8 and weigh 176 Ibs.  Ordered a medium and it  fits like a glove. This dress shows all the right curves .. very sexy and classy.


In the picture I wore a waist girdle just to get that  smooth look in the mid section. I purchased the dress for a friend's wedding and looking forward to wearing it. Perfect formal dress for any occasion. I advise to purchase your size because the fit feels  true to size.
