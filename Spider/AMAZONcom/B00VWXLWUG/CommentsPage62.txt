I ordered two dresses, both costing over $100, before finding this one. As soon as I tried it on my husband said that's the one! I am smaller up top but rather hippy and have ample butt; usually between sizes 12-14 for bottoms. I played it safe ordering the 2x; however, I should have ordered the xl but the dress was a hit anyway. It has good stretch, super comfy but it is long for shorter ladies. I am 5'7 and wore 3" heels and the dress was still floor length (nothing alterations wouldn't fix if I had time). The only downside is the bracelet I wore got caught on the dress a couple times leaving snags so I am not sure if I will be able to wear it again. Overall it's a great dress for an amazing price...buy it!!!

Dress fits well, it is a little long though. I love the way it fits my curves!!
