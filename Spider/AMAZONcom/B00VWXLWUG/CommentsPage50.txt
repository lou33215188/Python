Very nice quality!! So many compliments


Fits great on my daughter...She wears a small but she order a med.....great choice..


The dress is pretty and fits just right but it was too long for me Im a 5"3 and didnt really like that Im not shaped for the dress... but for a slender tall lady would be perfect....


I love the dress but, its way too small!


I'm actually amazed at the quality for the price I paid now I'm super excited to put this on a wear it to my carnation ball!


sooooo elegant.


Absoulty stunning


Amazing dress and very cute.


Just  as  in picture, xxl is like a sz 12 with some strech.


Beautiful dress great fit
