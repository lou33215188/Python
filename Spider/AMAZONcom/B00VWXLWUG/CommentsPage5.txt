almost ordered the Large, glad I ordered the XL - I'm 5'4, 175lbs, size m/l top, 8/10 jeans - this dress is very form fitting, so the large just wouldn't have worked...only thing is it's VERY long, will have to hem it (and that's with 3 1/2 inch heels lol), and the neckline draping is a little interesting - may tack it so it drapes better, but otherwise very happy - also surprised with the fabric - I thought it would be thinner, but it's nice and sturdy.  One thing, the top is lined, but it's not long enough to cover "the girls"...and since the back is low enough that a bra would show, I'd suggest getting the "petals", or whatever they're called unless you want everyone to know if you get chilly lol


Unfortunately Amazon delivered it days later than expected so I wasnâ€™t able to wear it to my event. I tried it on just to gauge how the order fit. Iâ€™m a size 9/10 ordered a L. The material is very stretchy with room to breathe and move. If I keep this dress I will have it taken in more at the waist to accentuate the hourglass shape. Material is quite expensive looking (at least in black). Like many other reviewers, Iâ€™m preferable to wearing the dress off one or both shoulders. I have large breasts and it did not cowl at the neckline but the dress just looks better off the shoulder. The only thing I was really disappointed about was the height. Iâ€™m 5â€™6 and I prefer my dresses to touch the ground in heels. Wearing 4 inch heels with this dress made it high - that weird look where the shoes are showing. Because this is a sort of flare out dress I think it looks better/more seamless flowing to the ground without the shoe immediately visible. I will have to wear lower heels to achieve this look - and Iâ€™m not very tall to begin with so I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d recommend for ladies 5â€™8+. Ultimately I think I will keep this dress because the black is very classic looking and can be worn at a variety of formal events.


Purchasing clothes online is probably one of the most challeging things because you don't know how the item will fit. So, I took some time to review  the other reviews and photos; I figured this would be a good buy. Needless to say,  I am extremely  happy with my purchase.  The material is very nice of decent quality and you can certainly wear this dress to any upscale event.


Based on the reviews of others who reported they were also a size 16, I decided to order one size up. But after receiving and trying on the dress I definitely didn't need to order the XXL, an XL would have been perfect for my curvy pear shaped 16, 5'4. Although, the XXL is somewhat lose, I still find it very comfortable and the stretchy like material makes it form fitting to the body. I threw on a body shaper slip to smooth out the backside and my few mommy bumps and now this dress is rocking.  I purchased the black but plan on ordering the blue in an XL. I'll post a picture soon. Thanks and thanks to all the ladies who also wrote reviews and posted pictures to help out everyone else with this purchase.


Reading some of the reviews, I was a *little* concerned the fit would be wonky, and you never know when you shop online from a seller you have never gone with before. I figured, $40 is cheap and Amazon is so easy to return to, what the hell!


So happy I went for it. I got boat loads of compliments (from hoity-toity rich AF people).  It fit like a glove and was the perfect length. Amazing purchase.


I am 5â€™7â€�, about 130-135lbs, 32DD/DDD and the Small was perfect for me. The length was good, and I wore about 4.5â€�-5â€� heels, probably would have been a little better with 3â€� heels. My chest filled in the neckline more than I expected, given the storeâ€™s photo of the dress, making it almost more boat neck lined. I actually loved that more.


I received so many compliments wearing this gown! My only complaint would be the material being thin. If you purchase it, be prepared to wear some kind of slip or shaper underneath.


I followed the chart and ordered this dress in 2XL I'm 5'10 and wear between size 16-18US. The dress arrived on time and as expected.  The color looked more red in person but looked burgundy in my pictures. I wore 3.5 inch heels and the length was more than enough. If your a tall curvy girl you will not be disappointed. The dress has some "give" (stretch) to it and fit like a glove!. But be warned, if you have bumps and rolls that you want to hide, make sure you have a very good "foundation"! Spanx or some kind of shapewear is a definitely needed, because this dress will show everything. Very happy with my purchase.


Just got this today for a gala this month...have been stressing to find something sexy AND elgantly classy...this is it. I will have to have it shortened, but, at 5'0" I'm used to that! I did take a chance on a small..it is very snug and shows a few lumps and bumps, but, hoping my cleanse takes care of some of that and if not, will do shapewear. I did order a glittery gold brooch to pin the top off to one side like another reviewer did as it makes it even more elegant and unique. Super soft, medium weight. Love that the back is low. Will be a hair up night! Ordered gold glittery shoes here on Amazon to go with the dark blue. Looks stunning together. For reference, I am 5'0", about 135, 34C, curvy. I got the small. Will update with photo once I put it all togther.


Words canâ€™t express how amazing this dress is. The fabric is very thick and of a high quality and the fit was perfect ğŸ‘Œ. I had worn heels with the dress and even then it was touching the floor a little bit while without heels it is definitely sweeping the floor even thou Iâ€™m 5 8â€�.


(Disregard the dust on the mirror I was using in the pic)


I was hesitant to buy a dress blindly from online and even more hesitant over the price but like others have said, I was pleasantly suprised! I am 5â€™8 and 135, and a 34D and wear a medium (size 6) for most things- I ordered a small based on reading some reviews describing stretch to the dress. It fit like a glove with stretch to help move with your body. I would have liked the neck to drape more (the only reason I didnâ€™t give it 5 stars) however I feel if I sized up then the whole dress would have been a little loose. You want this dress to hug you. You can wear it a little draped or more stretched out over the shoulders as you can see while looking through all the different posted pics. In the end? Glad I took a chance, glad I bought it, looks glamorous, I wouldnâ€™t say it looks expensive but it doesnâ€™t look cheap (if that makes sense? More like a medium?) itâ€™s comfortable and flattering- I am going to be wearing it to a formal wedding. I donâ€™t expect you to be disappointed with this purchase.


Absolutely love this dress!  I searched high and low for my wedding dress.  I didn't want the typical big, poofy wedding dress.  I wanted a dress that was simple yet elegant.  And this was it!  Fit as expected.  Very form fitting, not a lot of stretch, but just enough to show off the curves.  Added a bridal sash (also bought on Amazon) to add a little bling!  Definitely recommend!
