UPDATE:


I got so many compliments! I was comfortable, all night long. Felt like I was wearing pajamas! Other than being long (which I expected because, everything is, when you're only 5' 3"), and the cowl neck being a little awkward on (no boobs, either because, I got the short end of God's 'let's bless the women with boobs' stick, too'), this dress fits me like it was custom made. Makes me feel like a movie star! Hugs my hips and body in all the right places. Still enough room underneath to wear my spanx because, 3 kids= mom tummy, no matter how many sit ups I do! I'm going to find a brooch to bring one shoulder to the side, and fix the issue with the cowl neck, and I'll hem it to my shorty length, and I'll be set for this years 'old Hollywood glam' themed Air Force Ball! I'll post pics after I've got it all done!


Beautiful dress and colour. It was not fitted on my body. I have to do drastic adjustments. I am petite. Would have loved an XS option


I'm 5'6" and about 120 and the small fit perfectly. It is a little long and does drag the floor just a little in heels but overall it is much better than I expected since I'm always weary of ordering clothing online.


This dress definitely surpassed my expectations....


I needed a “wedding dress” for Vegas ... not too much but still elegant!!!!


I’m curvy/ dress size 12-14... 5’3 hope this helps!!!


You must buy this. Absolutely beautiful!!! Bought a LG I'm 5'4 and 160lb it fits perfect.


Beautiful material...looks great!!!!


Had to return because it was to small.  Wanted to order a larger size but the return process didn't give me that option.


The picture does the black lace dress on justice. Beautiful in person. Love this dress!!!!


I like the way the dress fits my body however it’s short. I’m 5’8” y’all and weigh 175-180 the dress doesn’t exactly go to the floor with out heels.


Great fit! Looks great
