Only problem was it to long


I received the wrong item.....


Very beautiful dress.


Perfect fit!


Loved it


It fits well but I will have to chop off 4 inches since I am so short.


Beautiful dress, great price. Fit well in all the right places! I was amazed!


Dress very comfortable.


Usually a Medium, but ordered a large due to waist and bust. Great decision.


However, I am 63" so i had to take up 1 /2


It's a bit on the long side, but otherwise, lovely.


I should of never ordered this dress! If I could give it zero stars, I would. First off, if your beyond a size 6 or 8 and have an ounce of fat on you, do not buy this dress! I am 5'10, 200lbs. I have a booty, but because of my height I don't look 200lbs. Until I wore this dress. I ordered the white because i was getting married. Quickie type of thing. Big mistake ordering it. The material was so cheap you could see thru it no matter what you wore underneath. Once I had it on I looked like a over stuffed sausage in a casing. It was truly horrible. Worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon! I can never get that special day back. The pictures are so horrifing I can't look at them without almost bursting into tears. They make me feel physically ill. I guess it's my own stupidity.
