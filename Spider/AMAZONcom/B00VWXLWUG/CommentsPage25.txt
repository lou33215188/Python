I'm 5'1", 115 lbs & ordered a small. It fits perfectly. The stretchy material fits my ghetto booty and my hourglass figure.


Love at first sight, not only is it beautiful in the picture but it was also beautiful in person. Fit perfectly.


This dress was so beautifully week I'm still getting compliments... stunning dress the pics does not do it justice.


At first I wasn't impressed. I paired it with some jewelry and a clutch ordered off Amazon and some elegant sandals from DSW then everything was perfect. I got so many compliments all night. It's a simple dress and adding some simple accessories will take it to the next level.


I admit I was skeptical that a dress at this price point would be a quality piece but I was impressed. The material was thick and the the sticking and design are as nice as the designer dresses I had tried on in Department stores. The fit is true to the sizing chart provided. I received many compliments and requests it was perfect for a black tie work awards ceremony for work.


Perfect as my daughter's wedding dress!


Just received my dress. It is a total different  dressed in the one that is pictured. It has a collar three-quarter sleeves and comes to my knees! I'm so upset. My wedding was next week and I ordered two other dresses this is the one that I wanted to wear the most!


Ordered according to measurements, fit like a glove. Great quality, looks high end.
