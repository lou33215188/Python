Love it!!!


Ladies.....if you are petite, this dress will be too long!!  Also....the material is very WARM and a little heavy!  I recommend only for a late Autumn, or def'ntly Winter-- formal attire!!  Had to try a belt with to hike it up somewhat...the only thing that will really work in order to wear it.  Arm holes need


more material-- a bit too small.  Front ways, it is beautiful..as is the color of green.


I love it


A very nice dress, well made and flattering. The material is stretchy enough to accommodate a range of figures too, so it's likely to weather those Christmas pounds pretty well. 4 stars, and that's only down to temperature - the material is heavy, which means it drapes really well, but it gets hot! It'll be a good winter formal choice because of that.


it was true to the size I loved it


The fit is perfect.


I absolutely fell in love with this dress .. I bought it in green for a Christmas party and it was definitely a showstopper .. I was able to maneuver the dress so I could wear it off my shoulders ....


love this dress! Material is a thick satin stretch seems a very good quality, wore this from 6pm to 2 am got tons of compliments. Was very comfortable and flattering, held up well to dancing. A great fit. I'm 5' 6" and could wear 5 inch heels. Looks less slutty in person :)


Can't say enough good can't think of one bad thing.


Such an amazing price fOr this beautiful, elegant dress. I'm wearing for my city hall wedding. Can't wait!


This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. I felt like a million dollars wearing it and got tons of compliments. My only complaint is that it is LONG. I'm 5'9", so this is usually not a problem for me, but it was still trailing on the floor even with the addition of 4" stilettos! Most people will probably need to hem it. Perfect for tall ladies, though!
