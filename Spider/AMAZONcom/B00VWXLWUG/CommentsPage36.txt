Decent material. Beautiful color. Usually where size 6 in dresses so ordered a small. Didn’t like my stomach showing (wearing spanx may help) but other than that, it’s a beautiful dress. Am 5’8” and the dress is quite long.


This dress is absolutely awesome. It fits exactly how it looks like it will fit in the picture. One warning is that it runs smaller. If you are a size 10 and usually wear a medium, you will definitely need to size up to Large. All this dress needs is awesome accessories and you will look great.


well made, cant beat this price $40-50 range, very good quality.  great colors.  website does not give justice to product.


the dress is beautiful...I went by some of the review and ordered a size up, but its too big...I reorder a smaller size hoping it fits better...but the dress is very pretty.


Very cute but my BF didn't like it so I returned it.  Lol.


Fantastic dress!  Fit as expected and nice, thick spandexy material.


Gorgeous, material somewhat giving to curves


Perfect! I'm 4'10 so I had to take up the front ( with stitch witch) to fit my heel height but other wise the dress was amazing. Quality was superb - and fit perfectly. The dress was a hit - I will order more.


I absolutely loved this dress! It was so lovely for the military ball I went to with my husband. Im 5’5” and the medium fit very well! It also it very streatch so it will fit you well


I am a small person and I usually wear zero or two. This dress was definitely too large for me
