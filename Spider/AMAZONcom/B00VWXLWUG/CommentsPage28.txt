This dress was absolutely perfect for my friend's New Year's Eve nuptials. I received several compliments and the emerald green was so gorgeous.


This dress was everything!ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜˜


I returned this item because the neckline was not as expected/presented.


Beautiful and elegant. Fit very well and I we soft and stretchy. Absolutely satisfied with the purchase!


Beautiful dress! I almost sized up based off of reviews, but decided to go with the XL. I am hippy and have thicker upper thighs and this dress actually accentuated everything in a classy way! I am 5'3 and wear a 14/16, closer to the 14 side though.


Beautiful dress. I ordered a bit large for my size and fits beautifully.  I will be adding some spanx to smoth it out some.  It moves beautifully


It is more of a forest geen than emerald, and the fabric is a heavy stretchy material not satin although the shine does give it that look and the seem holding the top and bottom together does buckle you cant really tell when its on and it fits as expected but it streches so much you could order a size smaller if you like a tight fit


This dress is beautiful and so elegant. I'm 5'5", 130lbs and I ordered a small. It fit perfectly.


Pros:


The dress fits VERY nicely


Love the stretch and the silkiness


the material is quality


The price is reasonable


Body conscious without making you look stuffed!


The length is GREAT for formal events with heels - mind your height


Cons:


the zipper had to get fixed cost me approx. 14.00 USD (considered giving dress only 4 stars due to this issue, but the price is still good overall)


For those with an hour glass shape, order your normal size


For those with an apple shape, order for "the girls" and maybe even a size up so you feel comfortable


For those with a pear shape, order one size up for the hips because this dress hugs


LOVE it.  This dress is AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!


Keeper! The color and everything is as in the pic. I think an XS would be a better fit for me 5'6-5'7 115-120 and I have curves. It is a bit too long even in my 4-inchers! Unfortunately, XS isn't an option, so if you are smaller than I am, you may want to plan for alteration. At this price, the dress is worth it!
