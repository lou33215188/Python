It is a beautiful dress, bought it for a 1920s Gala. Would definitely buy from them again.


I love this dress fits perfectly and also arrived early


Absolutely stunning.  And I mean the absolute perfect dress.  I actually needed a smaller size so I could show off the lacing in the back.  I got so many compliments it is my favorite dress now!  I wore it on my wedding anniversary and my husband nearly fell out of his chair.  It is well made, gorgeous, and the customer service is outstanding.  I simply am obsessed!!!


I love the dress however I used the size chart and it was way too big would like a smaller size


I love my dress! It was eye catching


beautiful dress but runs small. looks exactly as the picture. I think it would be scratchy though.


It fits on my body like a model.


this was a great dress for my themed event the Great Gatsby. I looked amazing in this dress. kudos out to the seller


The perfect dress! Loved it! So fancy!
