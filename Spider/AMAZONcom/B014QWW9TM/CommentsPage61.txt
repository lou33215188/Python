Everything was right about it


Bought this for my daughter's Senior Prom. She is a size 8, stands 5'5"ordered a size 8 fit perfectly she wore gold flats and the dress hung fine to the floor. Beautiful, many complements, well worth the money.


Pretty dress. but looks better online.


Bought it for my daughter for prom.


It fit, but just didn't have the wow factor.


Fits true to size, I am a 14 and 36DDD breasts. I was a bit nerve about a strapless dress since i am top heavy but it has enough coverage and is very flattering. I am also 5ft 8in and it still sweeps the floor which is great. I am a bridesmaid for a Gatsby themed wedding and this was perfect. Looks beautiful and best of all it was $50!


Dress arrived and meets expectations


great dress for the price


This dress was a HIT! !!!!!! I love it!


The dress fits exactly as expected, I just needed to shed a few pounds myself in order for it to be flattering.


good


Really pretty! But, it scratches under the arms, so I'd suggest getting a little cloth added so that your armpits don't get rubbed raw!
