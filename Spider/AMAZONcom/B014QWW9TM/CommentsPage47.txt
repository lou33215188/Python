Ordered my exact size. It was a little snug I was able to send it back and order the right size. I am greatly appreciative


Beautiful dress!! It's a little scratchy because of the sequins so I just have to be careful.


This dress looks just like the picture. A little big up top. But perfect!


It's a little too long. I'm only 5'2" and I can't cut it because of sequins but I bought 4" heels and that worked.


I loved the dress, I'm using it for my great gatsby themed wedding! The size was true to size I ordered. I'll be back to review after the ceremony


Beautiful dress!! Wore it to a masquerade ball and won best dressed!!


I loved the dress. Somewhat to large in the bust area. Stunning when I put it in, I had to keep pulling it up.


It's not true to size ...


This dress is stunning


Really attractive!
