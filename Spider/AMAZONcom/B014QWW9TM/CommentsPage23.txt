The dress is beautiful and the seller is pretty cool.  I was undecided about the size because my hips and butt are a bit bigger than normal so on the top the dress is a bit big and on the bottom it's a bit snug but thanks to the lace up back i was still able to make it work.


Packaging was good the dress arrived in great condition.


Love, Hugs, & Butterfly Kisses! â™¥ â™¥  love this so much> I bought most colors


Love the dress!! Fits perfect. Only issues is the sequence around the armpit but other then that...the dress is great.


Was a nice dress but the chest was too awkward for me


I absolutely love this dress! I am 5'2 and wear a size 8 in jeans and have a bust of 34 D and I purchased a size medium and it fit perfectly. The length was great when I wore heels but without heels, the dress was dragging. I wore this to a 1920's party and got a lot of complements on this dress. Would recommend.


If I could give this dress zero starts I would. The fit of this dress is smaller than expected. I had to get it altered and even then I wasnâ€™t too happy with it. It couldâ€™ve had more tulle material to make it look nicer as well. Itâ€™s very cheap material but did like the sequins on it.


LOVE THIS DRESS!!! Was perfect for a great gatsby themed bday party!


Disappointed the details weren't that great and it ran really small :(


Fits as expected, I am a little short so this needs to be hemmed up but it is beautiful.  Received when promised


Perfect for my Gatsby themed birthday party! I ordered according to the sizing chart and it was slightly bigger, nonetheless it was absolutely perfect for being the center of attention on my birthday party! Absolutely gorgeous and at a VERY reasonable price.
