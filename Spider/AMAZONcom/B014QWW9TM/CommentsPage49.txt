Gorgeous dress! I ordered this dress for a military ball and it looks just like the picture. It didn't fit my body very well, but I also ordered it in a larger size because I saw that the back laced up. It was a little snug in the hips (I wear a 12 in pants) and was too large in the top. I contacted the seller about returning it and they are refunding it with no hassle at all. Very good customer service. I plan on buying from them again.


Beautiful dress however too long for me.


I was nervous about buying online but with my jobs 20's themed Christmas gala coming up soon I decided to take a chance. I ordered the dress on Sunday night and was super surprised when I got home today(Tuesday) and it had already been delivered (that alone got the first two stars)  The dress looks just like the picture. Beautiful and long like I wanted. The design is gorgeous and looks like it cost a lot more than what I paid for it. It has weight to it but it's far from heavy. I ordered an XL because I know sometimes dress from overseas can run small but to my surprise it fit almost perfect. I will have some slight alterations done so that it fits my chest area better but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I am so excited about the gala now and knowing I no longer have to search for a dress is the best. Great dress awesome company :)


Exceptional customer service with quick helpful replies.  The dress is beautiful and well-made.


Loved this dress!


I read the reviews and am actually surprised people said it didn't fit. I got mine in the mail 2 days after I ordered it which was great because I decided on this dress less than one week before my birthday party. I tried it on and it was absolutely gorgeous and EXACTLY what I was looking for in a birthday dress. At first it seems small but once you completely remove the string in the back it slips right now and you can completely customize the corset to your size. I can see maybe how you can think it doesn't fit if you don't take the time to adjust it and assume it supposed to slip on as is. However, it is extremely well made and totally meant to fit different sizes. If you look at the customer pictures alone you can tell it looks great on everyone. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress.


sequins slightly scratchy, but good considering the very low price.


Fit perectly. Came a bit earlier, even with the express shipping. Comes in U.S sizes.


Love this dress! Wore it for my birthday party. Great Gatsby Themed!
