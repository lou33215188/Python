Loved the dress, it was great for my cousins harlem nights themed wedding.


Love the dress but somewhat small is size even though I order large ... I will not sent back just have to fit


The seller was very much helpful. The dress was beautiful when I tried it on it fit small but that's also because I have a little baby bump. So I spoke with the seller and I purchased a medium.


The dress fits perfect, l loved the length it was perfect for the occasion!!!


This dress was unfortunately too small for me, but Angel-fashions made the return process very easy!


Beautifully dress


Love this dress, customer service is very professional and kind. Will continue doing business with them. Delivery earlier than expected


Highly recommended


It's beautiful. It look like the picture on line and material was very good. It was too small for a large


It is even better looking in person!!

Love it! For the price, it's awesome! Fits true to size and looks/feels expensive.
