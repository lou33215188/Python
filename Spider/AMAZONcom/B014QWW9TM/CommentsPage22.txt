Its a very pretty dress, however it was a bit too snug for me around the chest area.  Would not have felt comfortable wearing it out to a party.  I am in between a size C & D cup.  I ordered a size medium as I am a size 8.  Giving it 4 stars anyway because it was fine in all other aspects.


I bought XL, white


I liked the dress but I had to return it because it was too large. The bust of this dress is very loose.


I bought XL according to the measurements on the size chart. I'm usually size 12.


I give it 4 stars because the sequins scratched me so bad when I was trying the dress on.


The picture looks great but the product doesn't.


I REALLY like this dress and would have kept it if I could wear it. My fault, I should have paid more attention to the size chart. Other than that I was beautiful.


This dress is amazing!!! I am in a production of medusa, playing the goddess Athena and have worn it at least 10 times. Fits beautifully and the straps kn the back adjust to your body. Love love love this dress.


Gorgeous gown, but too small for me.


I got a XL and could have been a bit bigger. Hard to get into yourself in back to tie up.


I was just a bit too thick in the waist.  Didn't get to wear it BUT kept it in hopes of working on my waistline and wearing it in the future.  I have wide hips also and it was just fine.


Stunning!  I wore this as Maid of Honor and received SO many compliments.  Well made!  The only issue for me was that my arms rubbed against the sequins on the side, so my inner arms got irritated.  But I wore it all day to a summer wedding outdoors.  I would absolutely wear it again!


Ordered last minute, arrived the next day. The dress ran just a bit large but thankfully the tie strings in the back tightened it right up. It was comfortable through out the whole night, I got a ton of compliments on it.
