It's okay. I'm a 14/16 and it's small.


Very nice  material and the color


beautiful!


Beautiful dress, great price! I'm hourglass, so it was difficult to get over either my boobs or my butt, but once I survived that ordeal, it fit perfectly. Not sure how it will weather after a party with all of the sequins, but for now, no complaints, I'm very happy with my purchase!


Its a very beautiful dress. Fits a bit big but with a little alteration it was just right. My niece got alot of compliments at her school ball


It if lovely but it would be nice if you could customize  the cup size


Beautiful dress, I received so many compliments on it.


This dress has by far exceeded my expectations. I was very hesitant to order a formal dress online. I thought the dress ran a tad large in size, but the ribbon in the back can be used to adjust. I'm so happy with this purchase and I can't wait to wear it out!


I was so nervous that my dress wouldn't be here in time for my Masquerade ball which is on tomorrow February 25th. I had free shipping which said the dress would where between February 24-Mar 1 and I received my dress on today and it's so beautiful!! It's look just like the picture!!


The dress is lovely and hugs my hips nicely. The only drawback was that the waist was a bit too loose. However, I can happily leave a five star review because of how accommodating the shop was. After voicing my problem they immediately resolved it and were very quick to respond to emails.
