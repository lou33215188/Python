The dress was a huge hit. It was comfortable and looked nice. The only downside for me was its length. I'm 5'4" and it rested at the top of my feet. My heels made it a bit more noticeable, but not horribly so.


The dress is beautiful in picture and okay in person, but the fabric at the bottom that opens up in a winged like style is very cheaply made. The dress is about 2 sizes too small.


I wore this to a Christmas party.  I was given so many compliments on my dress it made my head spin.  The dress is good quality.  The fit was what I expected.  It was delivered on time.  I will buy from this company again.


I love this dress! It is amazing! I got more people complementing me on this dress than any I have ever worn.


There were some snags on the sequins but it was easy to get out and didnt ruin the dress. It fit as expected, was a little big without lacing up but the lace in the back helps because the more you tighten it the more it fits snug to the body. I havent worn it for the occasion I needed it for yet so I cant say anything about how it holds up but I have confidence.


My God I love the dress it looked  so beautiful on my daughter everyone talked about that dress that night when she went to prom it was beautiful perfect color perfect fit it was awesome


Beautiful dress. It looks just as the picture shows. It fit my daughter perfect!


Pretty cute dress, put together well, wish it had a little more length and material.


This dress is beautiful and fits as expected. I ordered a large. You will definitely need help lacing the back. I received many compliments.


I wore this dress to a Mardi Gras Ball & got tons of complements. Loved this dress.
