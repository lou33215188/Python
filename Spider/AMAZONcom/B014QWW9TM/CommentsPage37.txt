It's great quality. Looks glamorous. I would definitely recommend.


Absolutely loved it


I will post more pictures when I go to the big event and the seller gae me great contact but one the was that the middle area was a little big because it is not a corset dress but I fell in love with it compared to other dresses for $200 and up $50 was awesome got more than my money's worth


I wore this to a ball and NO ONE had anything like it! Fit was good. I used the "Invisible" straps and had to worries about falling out. A very comfortable dress.


Exceeded my expectations for a 60$ dress! I am 5'2 &125lbs, wider ribcage. Ordered a small and it fit perfectly! Cannot wait for my event!


Beautiful dress!  I got compliments all night long.


The dress looks actually like the photo. It's very elegant with all the beading. Although not made with the best materials. It was shipped before the initial date which was good. It is not too revealing for the style of the dress.


Runs very small


Beautiful, simple dress.  A little difficult to get into because you have to completely unlace the corset but once it's on it fits perfectly.


the bust was way too small but fit everywhere else perfectly.


Got tons of compliments. Fit perfectly and material was nice. I was told I looked like hollywood royalty in it
