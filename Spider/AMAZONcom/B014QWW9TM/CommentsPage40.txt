I ordered for a wedding and couldnâ€™t be more perfect! Just as the pic is gorgeous!!! Everyone still asked where did I got the dress !! I love it!!!


Dress is beautiful looks just like the picture however did not fit my body shape , I'm 5'4 180lbs , 38DD , I ordered XL top part was too big , stomach part bunched up and made it look like a pouch , corset back did not help :(


Return was easy and seller was nice


I read the reviews runs somewhat small so I ordered a size larger. Perfect!


Just what i wanted for my 40th!! Beautiful on and loads of compliments


Have recommended the site and this dress to friends and family


super gorgeous dress way better then i was expecting for a cheep amazon dress it snags on stuff cuz of all the sequins but overall i love it


This seller is amazing! Even though the dress didn't quite fit me, they were very good about refunding me and the dresses are BEAUTIFUL! I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone!


Fits as expected, beautiful dress and good quality. Perfect price and fast shipping!


OMg this dress is so gorgeous. I order a small on May 11 and I received the dress by May 13. It looks so beautiful in person and I love it. Do not wait just ordered it this was the best experience I ever had ordering online and good costumer service. Thanks


Although it is a lovely dress, its sizing is way off .  I also wish there was a zipper or something for easier putting on and taking off. Also very rough under arms.


Dress is very nice. I will be wearing it at  my sister 50th wedding anniversary party.
