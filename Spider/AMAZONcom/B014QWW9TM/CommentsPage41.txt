My daughter is 5'3", 107 lbs, about a size 3. This gown is much too long, even with heels. It's is also very big in the busy, waist, and generally all over. No size extra small is available.


I am so happy with this dress not only does it fit, it's perfect for my wedding colors and theme. I found the perfect dress!!!


This dress was an excellent fit. Was even a little big for my 14w size. Would not recommend for any size bigger than a 16. Will buy from this company again.


Was sent a size small when ordered a xlg. Fit my friend great.


This dress was everything I wanted and more. Fits true to size.


Better than I expected.


I LOVE this dress one of the most beautiful dresses I bought from Amazon. I look forward to wearing it for my occasion & shopping for more dresses with you all.


I normally wear a medium but I am five months pregnant so I was hoping it wasnt too small. Fit great and will work perfect for a Gatsby theme wedding!


Gorgeous dress! Very true to size.


I ordered the large according to the size chart and it was pretty accurate. I love the flow and the fit, it looks just like the picture, Beautiful dress. All of my co workers loved it. So did I!!
