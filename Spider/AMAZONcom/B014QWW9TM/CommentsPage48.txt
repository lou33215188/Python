I gave it a 4 star rating only because there is no support, but truth be told, for a gown that looks this good for this price getting your own support is a no-brainer! I got compliments beyond expectation.  It was absolutely gorgeous...and what's even better is how well it travels.  I folded and rolled it and just hung it up when I got there. Have not had to do one thing to it. Oh, and the other thing that puts it in the 4 star category is the fact that it can chaff the upper arms after wearing it for a while. Another reviewer has mentioned that it and it true, so you'd do well to take a shawl or something to put between you and the dress if you're out for a long evening.
