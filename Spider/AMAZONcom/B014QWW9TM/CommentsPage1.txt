I read all the reviews before purchasing so I knew it didn't have any boning which would help the fit in the bodice dramatically.  However, with the corset tie back and the light padding in the chest, you can adjust it somewhat for a more custom fit if you aren't going to get alterations. That said, it is exactly as pictured (always a plus and kudos to the seller).  It is a cream color sheath with a sheer tulle and sequin overlay. It is not heavy in weight, has a great flow, and very comfortable to wear (similar to a jersey knit) compared to most formal wear. The gold sequins catch light nicely and I had a few friends that said it has a 'red-carpet' style and it looks very elegant (I agree!).


I am 5' 2", 130 lbs 36-28-37; ordered the medium since I knew it would need alterations to the hemline and figured it's easier to take in then let out.  I probably could have ordered the small but then wondered if it would be too tight.  this type dress should hug but not be too tight fitting.  For the price, even with alterations this is a great option for formals, cruises, or in my case hosting a charity event.  I ordered it Saturday and it arrived today (Tuesday) without expedited shipping which was a pleasant surprise as I expected it to take at least a week.


I included a few pictures, not the best backdrop but I couldn't wait to try it on, I really like it.  If I can I will add additional photos after I have it hemmed if anyone is interested. I did not get a shot of the back but it is the same as pictured by the seller.


ğŸ˜‡This dress was a dream! It turned heads, broke necks, I was every woman's envy and every man's fantasy! What else could a girl ask for on her birthday?! ğŸ˜�


The express shipping was AMAZING! I ordered on May 31, 2016 and received it June 3, 2016 (the day before my 1920's themed birthday party, risky I know, I'm naughtyğŸ˜ˆ).


It was easy to try on, comes with a sash and optional clear straps. Looks just like the picture and is plus sized friendly. I measured my bust, waist and the widest portion of my hips and opted for a 2x even though I normally wear a 1x. My thought was that I'd rather it be too big, than too small (I could always have it taken in). It fit just right. I was able to move around,  dance, comfortably sit down, go up and down stairs (with and without heels on). I'm only 5'2, the dress didn't drag. The lace up in the back also helped, but be advised it's NOT a corset.


For plus sized ladies, I would advise that you wear a strapless bra for support and possibly a waist trainer for cleaner lines in the silhouette.


Also carry some hydrocortisone cream for your under arms, the sequins tend to be a bit scratchy by the end of the evening, but it's to be expected. (FYI The sash was my friend, when it came to the sequins under my arms.)


When I had  my inquires, the seller was very helpful and got back to me quickly.


If you buy this dress, don't hesitate to post a review. The written and picture reviews are why I bought this dress!ğŸ’–


This dress was beautiful! I bought it for a 1920's inspired photo shoot and it worked perfectly. I bought it on short notice so I got it a little big just in case. Thanks to the corset back I laced it as tight as possible and it worked for the photos! The seller shipped it to me in just a few days!


great fit, amazing outfit for 1920s party. it comes with clear straps I chose not to use them and regret it... but other than that its perfect!!!


I was very skeptical about ordering a dress from online.  I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews.  I'm glad I did just that. The dress fit perfect.  It arrived very fast.  It was absolutely beautiful.  I received so many compliments.  The only thing I didn't like about the dress was the irritation it gave my arms from all of the beading.  It was very itchy.  My arm was very red and raw by the end of the event.  If you are not good with things scratching and/or pulling at your skin all night then by all means don't purchase this dress.  I felt I should mention that because I didn't see anything about that in the other reviews that I read.


It's a little big on me..I wear a size 2/4 .. But it's a beautiful dress and perfect for a Gatsby event !


Absolutely LOVED this dress! I bought it for our bicentennial kickoff gala which was Gatsby themed. It was perfect! I got so many compliments on the dress and felt amazing in it! It is not a super structured dress but the lace up back allowed me to make it fit as needed. A great dress for the price and customer service was great! Will definitely order from them again!


A little info for the sake of future buyers: I'm 5'6 and I weigh about 135 pounds. I purchased the dress in a medium since my derriere is on the bigger side. This dress fits my rear nicely but it a bit loose in the chest area (I'm a B cup) even with the corset fully tightened.This dress was a bit long for me; I am not wearing any shoes in the photo. The built in cups are decent enough that I plan to wear this without a strapless bra.


 This dress is true to the photos and is a steal at $50. My only concern is with the edging around the top. While the sequins all reflect gold this gold trim reflects a rainbow of color and looks a bit cheap. However this is a very small section and barely noticeable even close up.  An important thing to note is that the color is darker than it appears in the photos. It is a deeper cream shade but this made it even prettier in my opinion. The shell is hemmed but the bottom of the outer layer is not. However considering the material fraying shouldn't be an issue. Since there is no boning you need to stand up straight to avoid looking crinkly.


 It shipped rather quickly. The bag was shockingly small but the dress was not wrinkled or damaged. I was surprised to find a thin nylon-like scarf in the package as well. The scarf is white so it does not match the dress, but I wouldn't have used it anyhow. The dress also came with clear straps that can be added.


Well being a 34 H cup I know getting a small was risky lol I am a size 4/6 pants and was hoping the lace up would make room for my breast. I think I need to get a large and have it altered or I just look like I am doing the most. The only way I could get this on was unlaced and over my head.  I like the dress and the design. The fabric is a bit med-light weight and really soft. Its not as flattering on me as I would like so I think I will send it back.


The dress is absolutely Stunning and I love it.  It fit as expected , I am a size 8/10 and my measurements fell into the medium size  on the chart, however, I did order The large size due to my hips because I usually have difficulty fitting them into things easy and I figured worst case scenario I could just have it altered before my event but it's perfect , I was shocked and happy.  Its a tiny bit big in the bust and waist,( my waist is quite small compared to my hips ...I'm very hourglass) but it was nothing a little adjusting and tighter lacing couldn't fix ..its barely noticeable at all.  The material is beautiful and it looks regal and expensive , not cheap and I was worried about trying to find a cover for my arms and I was pleasantly surprised to see it came with a matching shawl which solved that problem and saves me time ! It arrived promptly as expected and I had a wonderful experience with customer service , they were more than accommodating and helpful. I'm very happy everything went so smoothly , because I've had prior issues with online shopping from Other websites but this was shockingly fantastic.  I will definitely recommend to family and friends .  I feel beautiful in it and I can't wait to wear it for my photo shoot and see what it looks like in the actual magazine when it's released !!  My husband and family loved it as well. My husband said " it's a beautiful dress , that looks even more beautiful now that you're in it "  which was sweet. Overall, excellent product, service , quality and price !!
