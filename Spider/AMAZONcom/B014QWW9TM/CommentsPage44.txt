It's beautiful but slightly longer than I expected and its scratches my arms a little but, but this is perfect for my Great Gatsby themed formal.


Definitely love this dress!! Worth the buy! I am 5'5ish and bought a small, it was a bit too long but I also did not wear shoes at all. Got a lot of compliments at prom and just out and about from people I didn't even know!


Beautiful dress! I wore it for a sorority formal and I got lots of compliments on it


Fit great when I tried it on but the stitching was coming apart when received but very beautiful!


Really cheaply made. Looks good on screen but once I got it home.....let's just say quality is not makers strong suit.


Somewhat large at top; the rest of the gown fits perfect and it's beautiful.


Gorgeous dress and got lots of complements. However postage said free, but when at checkout it got added and was huge, just would have liked to know before. But dress was lovely for a dress up Gatsby party!


The dress fit great! It did, as the other reviews warned, rub under my arm raw and left several little scratches but other then that the dress was wonderful. The style is just as pictured and made well!


I really do love this dress and it was a hit
