I felt super elegant and many people complimented my dress. It is pretty sharp on the under arms and chest area. I liked how it looks beautiful on everyone in the reviews.


This dress is soooooo darn cute!!! I'm 5'10", 185lbs, 36DDD-31-45 are my measurements and I ordered the size Large and it fits just fine. It's nice and long as well. I feel like royalty in this dress.


Angel-fashions was an extremely amazing seller to work with.  Their customer service is impeccable and the dress is gorgeous.  Definitely fitting for a Gatsby themed event!! The dress fits well, and is only a little long on me but I am 5'2". Only thing to keep in mind is that the sequins may irritate your arms throughout the evening but that is minimal in comparison to how pretty it looks!


Recently ordered & received this dress. Unfortunately, did not fit me as expected. But the dress is beautiful in person, looks exactly like the pictures. I would recommend ordering a size up. My reasoning for the 5 start review is when I attempted to return the dress, the seller contacted me back immediately and not only offered to refund me but went as far as asking me not even to go through the hassle of returning the dress back. I have never experienced such amazing customer service from any seller on the past. For that reason alone I will be a repeat customer to them. Thumbs up !


This dress is beautiful, but it did irritate my skin on my side. I got a size S, and it suited my perfect. I'm a 32 B cup, 5'2 and normally a 7/9 in jeans. It was a little long, but my heels helped a lot. I wore it for my Masquerade birthday party. This is a steal!


I adore this dress!!! I have never felt so beautiful in my life. I wore it to a 1920's themed wedding and received compliments all night and from everyone who saw the pictures.


My only complaint is that the sequins will cut up your arms and arm pits and it will hurt, but beauty hurts, right?


This dress is absolutely stunning!!! I wore it to a Great Gatsby themed party and won best dressed. It is so much more beautiful in person than jt is online. I like how it has the tied up corset back so you can tighten it loosen it as needed. I am 5â€™10â€� and 150 lbs and the medium fit perfect. You will not be disappointed with this dress! So many people complimented me on it and couldnâ€™t believe I got it on Amazon. Buy this! You will not be disappointed!!


This. Dress. Is. Amazing.  For the price of this dress, I didn't expect much at all.  I was mistaken! This dress flowed and fit perfectly.  I even could have gone down a size!! It made me feel fabulous at my husbands military dine out, and I got compliments all night.  Sequins all stayed on even! Great purchase.


The dress was good quality and beautiful. My only problem was that the sequins irritated my arms and hands. Not an unusual problem for anything sequin coated. Will wear opera gloves with it next time.


My wife is 5"5 and 144 pounds and order a medium. Love love love it. Mardi Gras 2017
