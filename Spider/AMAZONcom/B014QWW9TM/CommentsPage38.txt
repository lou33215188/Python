I am actually using this dress for my brides maids and I love it as must as they do.


I loved the dress, but I needed to get a size up than what I normally am. The return policy was very easy. I just printed the return label and sent it back. The refund to my account took a couple days as one would expect. Overall, still a great experience.


Very happy with the dress and it was a sunrise that it arrived so quick. I ordered a large, I don't know my exact measurements but I know I have a D chest and 32 waistline and this dress just goes with my body so well. Very excited to wear it for my college prom.


Dress was pretty... but the sequence on the dress scratched my under arms so bad they were burning and bleeding.


I'm so very happy with this dress!


Got so many compliments on New Year's Eve!


I ordered this gown for a Great Gatsby event with friends and it was perfect! It fit as expected, I am 5'11" and ordered a medium. It went to the floor without dragging when I was barefoot. The fit was good, a little lose in the upper area but can be adjusted with the corset ties in the back. Overall I really was impressed with this dress and kept it for my next elegant affair. It is not "costumey" like I thought it may be.


This dress is perfect! I'm not adding photos because the pictures of women in the dress are on point! I'm so excited and so happy! It fits perfect! I ordered a medium and have no issues! I'm wearing it for my vegas wedding. Ordered on the 25th, got it on the 28th, the day after easter! I highly highly recommend!


Fit as expected. It came on time and the dress looks like the picture.


I absolutely loved this dress, it is beautiful, I received so many compliments on it,from ghe look to the fit.
