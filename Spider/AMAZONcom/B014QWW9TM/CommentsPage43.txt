Super pretty dress. Runs super small.


Beautiful dress and quality. The dress would have been perfect if it was smaller through the waist. Tied the corset to the tightest possible but still looked loose.


This dress is very beautiful and sparkles with gold. The package arrived on time and I just realized that it came all the way from China. Actually I've ordered many dresses from China before on other sites and I've always had good experiences. I love how this dress has lacing in the back so that I can tighten or loosen the fit how I want. My waist is small but I have a broad back area so I normally can fit in my dress size but it's hard to get the zipper all the way up so I either have to order bigger sizes or take a chance in my size. I ordered a medium in this dress and it fits perfect, the length was also fine. I must add that there is no support in the bodice so if you are large in bust you will need to add additional support. The dress arrived in great condition and I am glad I made this selection.


I purchased this dress for a 1920s themed dinner and it was perfect! Looks better in person! I got so many compliments all night. Worth every penny!!


Im a plus size girl and i thought size 16 would be fine but they run a little smaller than what i was expecting.


Beautiful Dress, runs small, fast shipping


Pretty and as described but just didn't look good on me so had to send back.


Just like the picture.  My daughter loves it. Well made and true to size.
