I normally wear a 10 in jeans from American Eagle but still a S/M in tops. I decided to order a medium to see how it looked.


Once it arrived (about a week early) I tried it on to see. Previous reviewers mentioned that there is no structure at the top and that is correct. Once my husband attempted to tie the corset back (almost all the way tight, almost impossible to take it in any more with just the corset back)I decided to still take it in for slight alterations to bring it in in the waist. $20 in alterations later it was taken in some and allowed me to actually see the corset back.


The dress was great for our holiday party! I got several compliments. Only complaint is that it is scratchy under the arm from the sequin, but I managed. I did wear a full slip that has a strapless bra in it. I think that helped with the lack of structure in the dress.


I love, love, love this dress. After reading the reviews I ordered the 2X because I knew it could be adjustable due to the corset back. I purchased it to wear for formal night on the cruise. I received so many compliments, but my favorite compliment came from a gentleman that said my husband and I looked like a Fairytale!  I felt that way also. I normally wear a size 16 in women's. I had plenty of room to cinch the dress down with the corset back. This dress is very flattering. The only negative is the sequins under the arm can be slightly irritating, but it wasn't bad to me. I highly recommend this dress!


This dress was a complete hit at the 007-themed NYE party I attended last year. I got so many compliments!


I ordered a medium and the fit was great - for reference I am 5'7, 34B-27-39. The back ties up for a snug fit which is helpful because you can tie it in more or less depending on your bust.


I was also able to resell the dress on eBay for more than I paid for it because seriously, it looks expensive so that was a plus. I would highly recommend this for a special event!


My dress was too cute! A little big, only because im a little small.. However, i got a lot of praise on my dresses. I was made just like the pic..


It is a gorgeous dress and looks as pictured, but wow is it loose, I bought the smallest size and it is still too loose in the bust and the corset will not go any tighter. I am petite (5'2" 115lbs, some curves and a 32D for reference)...and obvisouly it's a long gown so high heels are necessary at my height. The dress is a steal for the price though and is a stunner.


I cannot say enough great things about this company, they were incredible!  The first dress I ordered was a little too small.  They made the return process a pleasure!  The second dress was perfect, and I received it in 3 days from China, now that is AWESOME!  My daughter wore this dress for her Sweet 16, and people are still talking about how beautiful it was!  I will definitely purchase other dresses from this company and will spread the word as much as possible!


I went with other reviewers recommendations and ordered my size. I'm a 36dd bust, 150 pounds, 5'3 tall. The large fit perfectly, the lace up back is great. It gives a lot of room to tighten if needed or let out. I feel like this is a dress for most women's sizes. The quality was great and I wore it for a formal event and received a lot of compliments. It looked a lot more expensive than it was. I ended up not having to get it hemmed as I wore pretty tall heels and can see myself wearing this again in the future sometime. It definitely gave me that great Gatsby look I was going for.


This dress is Gorgeous! Fits well. I am 5'4 and 205 lbs and the 2x was A perfect fit considering that I am a bit busty..38 G. If it wasn't for that, I could've talen the XL.  I was cohosting an event for 90 mins and I was comfortable the entire night. Harlem Renaissance themed.  I can not wait to wear it againâ�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�


Beautiful dress... I got plenty compliments but i was not satisfied with the overall look of the dress. The sequins caused some serious irritation under my arms and i had seen that in a previous review also. I'm a 42DD and there was still space in my top no matter how tight I had pulled the back and as u can see in one of the pics the lining just didn't stay in place. Final issue, it was shorter than I had expected. #epidasit


Other than that, it was a good dress.


Beautiful dress! I got so many compliments from women and men. It fit perfectly straight out of the bag, which is great because I usually have to have hems altered. I'm 5'2 and the length was perfect for me. My friend tried it on and it was pretty short on her, but the bodice fit her nicely. She is probably about 5'11 and has a different body style from me. The sequins are pretty scratchy under the arms, but it was totally worth it for this gorgeous dress.
