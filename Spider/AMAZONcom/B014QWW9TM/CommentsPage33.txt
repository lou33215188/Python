Very pretty dress


This dress is gorgeous! It fits as expected and it even came with a little sheer shall.


Loved it, the corset in the back helped to get it just right, EVERYONE loved it.


It's very pretty, but a little long and not as structured as I expected. It looks in the photo like it's bodice-like, but it's actually quite light and flexible. I was looking for something with a little more structure, and I was surprised that unlike the photo, there isn't as much definition in shape between the bust and waist - it's straighter on the sides, rather than tapered.


Very detailed, soft and comfy. Fast shipping! Well made and looks just like the photos.


Worth every penny! This dress looks exactly as it does in the picture and fits amazing. Very flattering cut, even on short people! Sequin are itchy against the arms, but that is to be expected. Great quality for the price, I would strongly recommend this dress!


Loved the dress. Nice quality fabric. The top loop on the back of dress came unstitched before I wore it. I ordered a xxl according to size chart and it was a size bigger than I needed. It came from China quicker than estimated delivery date.


Beautiful dress. I ordered one size up and it fits just right.


Very pretty dress, runs about 1 size too small.
