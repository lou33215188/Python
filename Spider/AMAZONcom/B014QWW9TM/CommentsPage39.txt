This is a very beautiful gown. It was just too small.


Sequence on the bottom of the dress is faulty.  It looks like the seem was placed incorrectly and the just cut away the over lap.  I am very disappointed


fit as expected, my daughter loves the dress


Beautiful dress,  but had to send it back a little too snug!


Bought this for my daughter to go to a ball in. Dress was beautiful she got many compliments on it.


My wife wore this at a great Gatsby party. She looked great. it did not need ironing or any alterations. She did need a special, ahh strapless restraint for the top part.


It's amazing, it was bigger at the top but it's worth the price. Looks fabulous. I'm wearing it fit my sweet 16 Great Gatsby themed party


Great fit, does fall down if you don't have boobs like me!


This just didn't fit me. And it will chew up the sides of your arm from friction from the sequins. Still pretty, but not going to keep it.


It's very pretty
