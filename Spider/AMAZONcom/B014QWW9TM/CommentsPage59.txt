Fits pretty true to size.


Love it gorgoues such a top of price


The dress was great.  The customer service was fantastic!


Poor quality won't order again


Very beautiful gown, but the sizing was a bit off.


Everything was good


This dress was so much more beautiful and exquisite in person than on the website.  It's stunningly beautiful and so unique and to top that off with the reasonable price for such a well made dress was the most wonderful trifecta for a fashionista.


I love this dress and will be wearing it after my wedding for the reception.  It's bound to be a show stopper!!


This dress was all around perfect


The fit was good except that it was too short. I am 5'8. It was also scratchy and itchy so if you have sensitive skin, this may not be the best option for you. However, the seller did an excellent job dealing with the issue and reimbursed me 2/3rd of the price of the dress without having to ship it back.


Perfect
