Bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it. It fit her as expected size she got. Dress looks amazing beautiful according to her.


I needed straps so it didn't work for me.


Absolutely LOVE this dress!! It fits perfect, and hangs perfectly!! It will definitely make me feel like the "belle of the ball"!!


This is a wonderfully beautiful dress! The gold pattern on this dress is so intricate and well crafted. Customer service was also top-notched! This seller is definitely a true gem here on Amazon! I will continue to buy from them!


I absolutely love this dress! Iâ€™m wearing it to my daughterâ€™s wedding and itâ€™s absolutely gorgeous! So glad I got it!!!


I'm shocked at how it looks exactly like the picture and the quality!  Great fast shipping! I'm a little on the short side so I'll need some alterations but this dress is gorgeous!


I bought these dresses for my bridesmaids for my upcoming wedding in June. They fit all of my girls so well even with their vastly different body shapes and I have girls across the whole spectrum. I could not be more happy with this purchase and recommend 100%!


Dress was a little big in the chest but nonetheless fabulous! I read many reviews about how people wanted a "Great Gatsby" look but I just wanted really nice, glamorous dress and that's exactly what I got!


This dress came in a timely manner and fits as described in other reviews. However, it does kind of scrunch in the mid section and I may need to add straps for my event.


But I was expecting this as others explained how it is not very 'structured'.


Had a rip in the seam. Have to take it in to get it fixed
