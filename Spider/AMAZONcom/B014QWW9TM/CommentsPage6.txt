I like this dress/it just was a little under uncomfortable


Surprisingly pretty!! It will need some minor alterations to secure the fit as the sweetheart bodice has not much structure.  It arrived quickly and unwrinkled.  Excellent value, great quality for the price! We will shop this seller again!!


I bought this dress for my daughter's winter formal. It really does photograph beautifully. I was a little apprehensive because I was unsure of how to fabric would be. Especially knowing that the price was so reasonable. 2 days later we received the dress. I really liked how to dress as a lace tie up in the back so that you can fit it to any body type. My daughter will be wearing this again to some other event later next year.


From the other reviews I expected it to be a bit less costumey than it is.  I also expected it to be long from the other reviews.  So much so, because I'm 5'0'', that I bought a trumpet underskirt to go with it but I think I just wasted money on that purchase now.  I would also consider the colour of the sequins on this dress to be COPPER rather than gold.  The top of the dress is lined with sequins and they are not comfortable underneath your arms.  I ordered after reading the measurements carefully and had my measurements taken by a seamstress so I know their right.  Somehow though, this happened to be a little bit too small. I'm going to try to deal with the sequin issue, maybe sew something soft over the armpit area. I'll leave with one good comment.  The bra area is actually pretty comfortable.


I was looking forward to wearing This dress for an event and I must say I am very disappointed. The dress looked beautiful on arrival but the sequins started shedding as soon as I attempted to wear it. It did not fit quite right as the sequins started feeling really itchy so I attempted to take the dress off. It took me a good 15 to take the dress off without damaging my skin as it was scratching on my skin and itching me so bad.I almost had to cut it off.  Very disappointed.


This dress was much higher quality than expected! Well-made and held up well through the evening. The dress arrived very quickly and was packaged well and wrinkle-free. However, I had a few issues with the size. I was in a rush and did not have time to have the dress altered. I am in between sizes according to the size chart and went with the bigger size, it was a little too big. I ordered the XL. My bust is approximately 40 in, waist 36 in, and hips 48 in. The dress fit my hips perfectly, was way too big in the waist, and was slightly too large in bust. I suggest that you do not order a size up, possibly size down. If you have an hourglass figure like i do, you may want to go with another dress as it ended up bunching around my waist and sliding down. The color and shimmer got me plenty of compliments despite the bunching!


So with a last-minute invite to a 1920s themed party, I was worried that this wouldnâ€™t arrive in time or it would be god-awful and the reviews were a lie. Luckily, it was neither of those!! It came on time and was just as described. The dress was properly lined so it wasnâ€™t see-through and it is a zipper as well as a corset tie so it can be adjusted. I am 5â€™6â€�, 120 lbs and ordered a size small. There were a couple of loose sequins and a small area with what looked like extra sequins but honestly, nothing I wouldâ€™ve noticed unless I was looking for something wrong. The color of the sequins is more coppery than gold but that isnâ€™t an issue for me...just something to keep in mind.


The corset top isnâ€™t very structured, looks like it is just lined with interface so no boning but I am an A cup so I donâ€™t need it to keep much intact.


Overall, I am very pleased and it is a great purchase! Hopefully there arenâ€™t too many other people at the party who thought the same thing and also got this dress!!


UPDATE: I wore the dress to my event and I have to knock off a star. It received tons of compliments but the sequins donâ€™t lay flat so I have tiny scratches and abrasions all on my arms and my dÃ©colletage from where they would rub against the dress. It was stunning but Iâ€™m scared to wear it again because it stung afterwards.


I can see why everyone gave this dress 5 stars! Super classy dress! It was lighter than I thought it would be but it came super fast with the expedited shipping The size does run a little big. Over all the dress was super cute, very classy and elegant and I would highly recommend it!


Beautiful gown. WAY to small after ordering it in an XL, I am normally a 10/12. The sequence are quite scratchy under the  arms. I tried it on and after 5 minutes I broke out in an itchy rash where the dress scratched me. I could not wear to the 20's party after all. I was very disappointed.


Shipping was outrageous! BUT it did arrive within a day and a half which was impressive. I am hoping to return it if the price is decent.


Stunning dress! Ordered a Large. I was a 34i cup wearing my wedding bustier and the dress totally fit my books! I'm almost 5'9" and the dress was long enough to wear 2 inch heels. If I wear the dress again, I will add some kind of hook to the panel behind the lace up portion because the panel slipped up multiple times during the night. It's also difficult to Slip on and I required assistance. The shipping was faster than expected but I live in the Bay Area and the dress shipped from China. Received tons of compliments! Worth every penny.


NOTE: make sure you have someone with you to lace up the back - and perhaps more importantly to take it off! After a night of dancing and sweating this dress will be almost impossible to take off (especially if you've been imbibing).
