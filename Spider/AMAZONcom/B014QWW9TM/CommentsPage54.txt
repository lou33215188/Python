Looks beautiful! Size chart was right on.


I purchased this dress as a last ditch option for my wedding. It arrived very quickly, and once I tried it on, I fell in love! It fit a bit large but only because I wanted to be safe since many dresses tend to run small. I decided to wear this dress to get married in, and got many, many compliments. Photographs very well, and lights hit it perfectly. The only draw back to this dress are the sequence along the sides which tend to scratch your inner upper arms quite a bit. I suggest a shrug, long gloves, or removing the sequence on the sides. Other than that, this dress is absolutely beautiful!!


Got two of the same dresses. Looks different. Need help


Exactly as advertised


I am absolutely floored!  This dress is exactly as it is shown in the photo.  I am 5'6, wear a 34DDD bra, and wear a 12 Jeans in American Eagle jeans.  I got the Large and it fit perfectly.  Unfortualy, the A-Line style is not flattering on my pear shape body.  I will be returning it, but the dress came in less than a week, packaged nicely, and dress is exactly what you're looking at.  I gave 5 stars because the dress is beautiful, the seller is prompt, and on the right body, this dress would be amazing!


It's absolutely beautiful but for it to be an extra large it feels a bit small.
