Beautiful !!!


The dress is beautiful, but it wasn't silver as in the description, it was white.  But the return process was fast and satisfactory.


I loved this dress! It was gorgeous and well made, just too large for my small bust :) Angel-Fashions made my return so easy and I will definitely order from them again!


This was such a magical find.  We needed a dress quick and it came really fast and not only fit perfect but looks amazing!  Would definitely order from them again!


was cut smaller then expected


Love it, can't wait to wear to my 1940's Gala!


Very small in size.  Not for bigger busted ladies.


Looks elegant


Pretty dress but to short. I'm 6 foot tall and thought it would work. Plus the sequence is extremely scratchy.


My wife was happy with this dress.  She will be wearing it for a Fall Festival.  She will also consider wearing on a cruise.  It is a little too flashy for most settings.
