I absolutely love this dress looks exactly like the picture.and it fits perfect!!


It's beautiful and I loved it however, it was hard to get into I had to have my hubby do up corset for me and the sequin and sharp they scratched up my hand pretty good.  The hip are was a lil tighter than I liked.  Unfortunately this beauty had to go back.  But the seller was very nice and made the whole process easy.


I ordered this dress to wear at a costume ball. It's lovely, if gaudy (but the occasion called for gaudiness). However, it was way too large for me. I ordered a size small because they don't manufacture this dress in a size extra-small. So if you wear a US size 4-6 and are at least 5'8 (or wearing shoes with heels that make you at least 5'8), a small will probably fit you. I usually wear a US size 0-2 Petite. I'm 5'3.5 and my measurements are approximately 31.5-25-35 (my bra size is 28C or 30B). This dress wouldn't even stay up when I wore a padded bra and applied heavy-duty fashion tape along the top. Additionally, the dress was too long for me even in four-inch heels. If you're shorter than 5'8-5'9 (in heels) and/or wear a smaller size than a US 4-6, don't buy this dress unless you have an excellent tailor and are willing the spend the money to have it altered.


Besides the size issue, the dress does not have a zipper and putting it on might pose a challenge for some people. I didn't struggle too much with putting it on because the dress was way too large on me, but I think it would have been more difficult if it had fit me properly.


Beautiful!
