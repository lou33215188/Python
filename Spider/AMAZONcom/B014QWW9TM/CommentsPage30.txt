It fit well. Love it


Gorgeous dress. My daughter wanted something that looked vintage for prom and this fit the bill perfectly. Laces in back are a little tricky to tighten just right, but once tied it stayed and she looked great.


Beautiful dress. Perfect fit. I am 5'3'' and 110 lbs and it fits perfect. Thank you.


Very pretty dress I was complimented all night I just wish the corset would have allowed to tighten up bra area just a little loose on top but beautiful dress and more than what I payed!!!


So unflattering. Returned it immediately.


Beautiful dress! Great for the price. Iâ€™m heavy set 5â€™4 dress was very flattering. I ordered an XL but have a wide back so had to undo tie up in the back with my own ribbon but fit ok everywhere else.


It is beautiful in person, and it showed up very nicely in all of my photos. I had to get it altered (the dress was shortened and the tulle layer remained the same. I am well endowed, the bust lining would come up sometimes. The next time I wear this I will have dress tape/etc to keep it in place. I got many compliments all night! (And after in all of the photos!)


Everyone loved my dress.


Beautiful but probably need a size bigger for my big bust


Beautiful fit
