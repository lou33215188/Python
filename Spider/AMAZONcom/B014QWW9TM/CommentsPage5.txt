Two things are causing me to give this dress a three star review. First of all, the sizing shockingly runs very large. I'm a solid 12, therefore I ordered a large, and it is huge! I have to wear a padded bra and safety pin the inside. (FYI - I'm 5'11" and have a 36D bustline). However, my main complaint is that on one side of the dress, there is a split in the design of sequins. It's awkward looking and unfortunately our party is this Saturday, so there is no time to reorder a fixed dress and size medium. That said, for the money, barring the defect and size being too big - IT'S GORGEOUS and a good deal for the money.

I bought this and another dress for a Gatsby event last weekend. The dresses arrived in 4 days, but I didn't allow myself enough time to get another size if these didn't work. I bought larges, which were too small and I was unable to wear either dress. However, the customer service was great, and rather than sending back the dresses, they sent me a couple of replacement dresses in XL that are lovely. They were very helpful and communicative, and worked very hard to make sure I was happy with my purchase. I'm also very pleased with the quality of the dresses. I would encourage anyone to purchase from this vendor.


The dress was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I ordered a 2xl because i thought it would be slightly smaller since i was ordering online but i would recommend you get your regualr dress size. I wore it to my prom and I was the only one going according to the other half of our theme (A 20's Masquerade) I got lots of compliments. It came it arrived earlier than the expected date. I got it for a good price. There is nothing better i can say about this dress! Absolutley loved it!


This dress is ABSOLUTELY stunning.


I purchased this originally from another seller because it was, but the other dress was poorly made so I returned it.


This dress is so gorgeous and with every penny. Buy it a size up if you're a bit curvier. I normally wear an xl, but the XXL fits perfect.


The corset back makes it hug your body perfectly. I seriously can't imagine someone this wouldn't look good on.


Length was perfect for me, but if I were wearing heels instead of flats, it might be a bit short. That being said, I am 5'8 with a booty and larger hips. It would probably be fine with heels if my bottom half wasn't so curvatious ;)


So happy with this purchase and the seller. Will but buy from again!


I felt like a Princess in this dress! You couldn't tell me nothing! I actually bought this as a back up dress for a Great Gatsby themed party I hosted. Good thing I did. Not only did it come fast, it looked amazing! The pictures don't do it justice. The back is a corset style, so you might need a little help to bring it in and give it that snug fit. It fit all my curves just right. It wasn't too tight and I could maneuver with ease. It is long, so you will want to be sure you are out the way or people are out of the way as you come through. It actually folds up nice in the bag for storage and when taking it out, it does not have any wrinkles. Great buy for the price!


Sizing can have you a bit nervous...but it does stretch a bit and again, corsets in the back.


I was absolutely blown away by this gown! I expected it to be cheapely made or be somewhat disappointed (from past experience with sketchy amazon sellers). The dress is pretty good quality and is exactly as pictured. I thought the sequins might look cheap or weird since there are none on the sides. It actually looked super trendy and flattering!


I usually wear a Xs-small and the small fit me pretty perfectly.

I ordered this dress as a last minute Mardi Gras Ball gown. I couldnâ€™t believe such a beautiful dress was so affordable!! I received several compliments, and felt like a queen. I am 5â€™3, 125lbs, 34B and the medium worked perfectly for me (with a little assistance sliding it on lol). The corset back allows you a little wiggle room to adjust it as you needed.


My only complaint lies in the fact that THOSE SEQUINS HURT. My arms are red and irritated from rubbing the dress all night. I had seen another reviewer complain about this, and I decided to risk it anyways. Just really, beware.


Itâ€™s not bad enough to prevent me from wearing the dress again, but just know youâ€™re arms will be a little raw the next day.


So the dress did fit a little snug but it was stunning!!!! I wore this for my great gatsby bridal shower and it turned heads!! It looked amazing! I was so happy with it. I made it work because thank goodness the back is a corset type back and i was able to adjust the strings. Iâ€™m 5â€™10, size 16 clothes so I guess you can say Iâ€™m plus size length and width wise lol but i was able to make this dress work perfectly. Iâ€™m a double DD so the top fit perfect and did not fall like i thought it would (i even purchased bling straps just in case it fell). The part that hits your underarm area did rub against my skin and did hurt but nothing that ruined my night or anything. I wore a foe fur wrap and tried tucking it under my arms which blocked it most of the night. I might even wear it again for my wedding night to change into as my second dress so i can party easier as my wedding dress is on the heavy side lol. Definitely recommend!!!


The dress is perfect for the Halloween costume I bought it for. Iâ€™m 5â€™3/130 and the medium was REALLY hard to get on and off but once on, fits great. Iâ€™m gonna work on loosening the corset part and see if that helps any. Itâ€™s a heavier weight and better quality than I had expected.
