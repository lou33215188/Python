just a little snug in the waist but it is fine and gorgeous


Great product - Well made but i had to return,... it was too big for me.


Wrong dress!  Not even strapless like stated.  No time to return as I need it for an event in a couple of days.  Very disappointed.


Too small and the fabric was cheaper than expected. Didn't wear it.


Beautiful!!!!  This fit well, I did however take the dress in at the top. The area was a little to large. I went to a 1920's Mardi Gras ball and received many complements. I was very happy with this purchase.


Did not like it' it looked old and dirty.


Fits great


I love this dress! Unfortunately it was too small and I didn't have time to re-order before my event.  But it is a beautiful dress.


I don't recommend is dressed to anybody  it came very big  I don't like it at all but want to give my money back


Love this dress. Fit like a glove. Everyone at the holiday party was stunned!!!...
