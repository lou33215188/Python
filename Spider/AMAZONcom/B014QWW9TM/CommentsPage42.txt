Beautiful dress. Loved everything about it. Got lots of compliments on how elegant this dress was on the night that I wore it.


absolutely beautiful.  The sequin work is exquisite.  Even prettier than in the picture.


Beautiful dress! It's stunning in person and well made. The inside lining is surprisingly soft and comfy. The sequins will scratch your arms a bit but other than that the dress feels great on. While the top would accommodate a much larger chest than mine, it doesn't work well for pear shaped bigger girls. As a size 20 on bottom, the lining fit, but not the sequined top layer that doesn't stretch. I'd recommend size 16 or smaller for this dress to work. (You might be able to squeeze in as an 18 but I wouldn't push it) the top is corseted though so if you're busty rather than pear shaped you should be good.

This dress is amazing. I did not need to hem the bottom like I usually do with other dresses ive owned in the past. I have not gotten to wear it to my event yet but I am dying to go out on the town with it.


Love the dress. Fits greats .


I love my dress but I'm going to have to have it altered to fit a little tighter


Stunning for the price


All day.


Gorgeous dress and incredibly comfortable. My dress arrived in 8 days which is very impressive since the eta was two to three weeks out. The price is a steal for how wonderful the dress is! I love it!


Loved the dress. Beautiful material. Unfortunately did not fit. Loved how quick the seller was able to respond to my return request.
