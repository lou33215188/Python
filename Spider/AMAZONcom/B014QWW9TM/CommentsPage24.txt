Love love LOVE this dress! It was just what I needed for my baby shower and came in handy after the dress I originally ordered got lost in the mail. The large fit me perfectly (with a little wiggling to get over the 8 month bump).


My daughter picked this out for prom and we were nervous buying it online. .but it fit perfectly and she got so many compliments. .


I loved the dress. But it fit a little snug on me. When I realized that it wasnâ€™t going to work it was after the return policy. I sent an email to Angel Fashions. Not only did they send me another dress. It arrived way in enough time for my party. The size up fits beautifully.  I LOVE IT!!!!


Beautiful dress seen perfect I ordered and received within approximately a week & half . This picture doesn't do it justice it's an excellent purchase will be purchasing more from seller in future.


Fits as expected. Better than my expectations. I really wanted something affordable but not Halloween costume quality and this was perfect.


Bought for prom and looked wonderful.


Hurts under arms as all the sequins are scratchy. Very cute and fit well after small alterations.


amazing!


Beautiful and nice but it's not that smooth touching like others dresses


Ordered an XL was too small and returned for a larger size (XXL).
