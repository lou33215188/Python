this was a great dress


Just perfect !!!


Beautiful dress!


Very nice


This dress is a stunner! I'm 5'8, 145lbs and the small was perfect! My husband had to help get it on and off and lace up the corset-like back, but for the price I was thrilled with this dress!


absolutely stunning used as my wedding dress and got endless compliments from friends family and strangers! Everywhere I went I got complemented over and over at how beautiful this dress was I could not be happier with this purchase I felt beautiful in this dress and very happy with the quality of the dress the sequins did not bother me as I read in other reviews very comfortable I wore it all night long!


I got married in this dress, so many compliments!!!


Love it, dress came in right on time. Dress a little big, nothing that can't be adjust. 100% on the dress.


it does not fit to the measurements


This is like a costume sent it back right away! This is a piece of junk. My daughter thought this would be the perfect prom dress boy were we wrong. I went to the dress shop and paid the 300.00 like I should have in the first place. Should explain it's a costume.!
