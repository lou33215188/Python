Great price and fits perfectly! Why spend $300 for prom when you can spend $40?


This dress is absolutely beautiful.  It looks even better in person.  It fits true to size.


This dress is an incredibly great quality for the price. However, I guess it's the curse of the hourglass but it is very very baggy around the waist and I would be afraid it would be too small if I went down a size (I am 5'10 150lbs and ordered a size Large.) Regardless of the bagginess around the waist, it is a beautiful dress and I am very happy with my purchase.


(The sequins under the arms can be quite uncomfortable as well but beauty is pain right? haha)


It's pretty
