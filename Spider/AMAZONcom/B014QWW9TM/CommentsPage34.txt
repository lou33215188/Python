This is an awesome dress. Beautifully made and wears well. It is much prettier than the photo. I was complemented the entire evening. You won't believe the dress you are getting for the price.

Size is way smaller than measurements they post. I even had a seamstress cautiously measure me. Dress looked like picture and good quality. So order 1-2 sizes larger.


Gorgeous dress for the price


Beautifull dress the strap on the back is great to adjust it tighter or looser on your bust!
