It was better than everything I expected. I chose this as my dress for my Gatsby Themed Formal and I fell in love with it I soon as I saw it in person. DEFINETLY RECOMMEND.


This dress OMG it was a last minute order but when I opened the bag I was in love I needed it for a Mardi Gras ball everybody loved it! I didn't want to take it off


Simply gorgeous!! Fantastic quality!


Love it just a little large! But would order again maybe in blueğŸ’¯


The dress arrived on time and fit as expected based on the sizing chart. Lightweight and very pretty.


It was pretty, but much too small


Extremely beautiful dress! Perfect fit! Ordered a size larger than normally wear! Looked and felt like a princess!!


Love this dress! I ordered 6 and they fit each girl as expected. The sequence may scratch arms, other than that the dress is what we hoped for!


Pretty dress for a ball or evening event


The dress was even more beautiful than expected.
