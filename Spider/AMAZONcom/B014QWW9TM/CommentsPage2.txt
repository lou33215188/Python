This dress is a steal!! I attend the military ball every year, so spending 300+ dollars on a gown each year gets pretty spends considering I will only wear it once. I received SO many compliments on this gown! The only reason I didn't give this dress 5 stars is bc after ab 2 hours of wearing the dress the lining on the inside of the bust area began to show (I'm busty and it is a $50 gown so naturally I was not surprised lol). Luckily the exposed lining was still gorgeous and barely noticeable! You'll notice in the attached photo what I am referring to. All in all a phenomenal gown for one or two evenings! ( I am 5'5, 150 lbs, 36DD)


The moment I got the dress I was very excited. I tried it on at the doorway. I'm currently 5'1 (i have really high heels on in the pic) and 141 pounds. I ordered a medium and tried it on the same day. It lace up find and I love the lenght of it. Felt like an elegant gown for a princess on me. My husband kept complimenting how great I loved in it. It was a little large in the bust area for me. And I'm a C cup. I would have kept it and sewn in the sides myself but there was a BIG defect in the dress!! So mad ğŸ˜ !! It had a 2 inch width across and from armpit lenght row of sequins missing on the side of the dress (see pic). I was so upset!  The dress is suppose to be symmetrical on both side and even my great sewing skills would not have been able to fit it without ruining the dress and making it even more obvious there was a problem with it. So I had to return it the same day I tried it on. I also used up my 10% discount and free shipping on this first order just so I can send it back!! Now I had to pay full price plus 2 days shipping just so I can get another dress delivered in time for my birthday, which is in a week!!! I would have given it a 4 or even a 5 ğŸŒŸ bc it's a beautiful dress and I'm still in love with how it compliments my dark skin but it's the inconvenience that is pissing me off and right before the last of my roaring 20s birthday party!! It better get there! Hopefully the small fits better when it gets here.


I hope this review help someone but still a great dress for the price. I will update you about the new dress of it gets to men in time. Sorry I ranted on so much.


The dress was definitely fit for the theme. The sequins under the arms hurt a lot and I actually ended up with very light  bleeding on the arms by the end of the night. However, I received many many compliments on the dress. Nobody could believe I purchased on Amazon.  I'm 5'3 160 pounds and I got the large. But it was too big around the waist. I would've definitely gone with the medium and it probably would've fit better. I feel like they run big by just a bit. For the price, this was definitely a good purchase


I bought this dress for my prom themed birthday party. I was hesitant to buy a dress on line because I was afraid it wouldn't fit or it would be delivered late.


I'm 5'1 220


I got a xxl and it fit comfortably. This dress got me a lot of compliments. It is a beautiful dress.  Very few sequins fell off. There are a lot of sequins on the dress but the dress is not weighed down. It is floor length and I didn't wear heels so I had to pick it up to dance or when I was outside.  The only thing I didn't like was that by the end of the night the sequins under my arms started to irritate and scratch my skin. I just took a piece of cloth and folded it over the sides of the dress.. Was not going to let a sequin ruin my night.  Anyway,  I opted for the 1day shipping.  I ordered on a Sunday evening and got my dress Tuesday around noon.  I looked beautiful,  felt great & had a awesome birthday.


Purchased this for my daughter's school pageant. She won best dressed and was also crowned Queen. She is petite (a size 0 -2) I bought a small but it easily fit me as well and I am a size 4. It has a corset back, so its adjustable. I bought the shoulder piece separate. It complements the dress well.


The dress is beautiful but it will not fit a big bottom woman. I had to get mine alter so it could close but otherwise the dress is BEAUTIFUL.


I love this dress, it's absolutely beautiful. I received so many compliments. I would definitely recommend this dress. It looks like the picture and fits perfectly.


This dress looed amazing on my daughter for her Great Gatsby themed Prom..I cant begin to tell you how many people commented that this dress was "divine" and amazing!!!


My daughter purchased this dress for a prom and it was gorgeous; there was nothing like it there and it reflected her personality well. She got tons of complements. She is 5'4" and 95 lbs, so we got it taken in and shortened, and also took in the back where the ties criss-cross. Spent more on altering it to fit her than she paid for it, but even then it was still cheaper than buying a normal prom dress. It definitely scratches the inside of your arms so it looks like you have a rash. The side seam split as she was walking out the door for the prom and had to duct tape it closed from the inside!!! But it could have been something the tailor did that messed it up. I'll never know. Anyway, it is a beautiful looking dress, albeit cheaply made (it is for costume purposes, as far as I can tell). One star off for the scratchiness on your arms.


This is a gorgeous dress and I got tons of attention all night long. I wore it to a 20s themed party and most everyone had on short dresses- wear this to stand out! The dress fit true to size and can be tightened and loosened using the corset type back. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is because if you do not wear long gloves- it will cut up the inside of your upper arms. The sequins are sharp and it would be impossible to remove them all. All in all- amazing! Get gloves!
