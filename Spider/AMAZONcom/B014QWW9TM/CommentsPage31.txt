The gold is super cute and I LOVE it. It is very itchy around the arms as the bling rubs against your arm (not the best for dancing). also my heals tore a hole in the mesh on the sides. So it is delicate. The dress is still quality and I do not regret buying it.


it's a beautiful dress but fits somewhat large even though i got a small size.


The dress was everything receive lots of compliments. I bought a small I was getting scared when reading the reviews but it fit perfectly l. I'm 4ft 11..150 pounds


Nice dress, good design. It did fit a little big on me, but there are straps in the back so you can lace it up to be as large or small as you need it to be depending on your frame.  It gives a nice hour glass shape which I really liked.


Beautiful dress - it is exactly as pictured. Came with an extra little scarf thing to match which was a nice surprise. The shop owner is the perfect definition of customer service. I recommend this shop to anyone and everyone. Thank you so so so much for fast shipping, beautiful product, and great customer service!


I love the dress...but I am too short-waisted. Having it altered would ruin the beautiful bead/sequin work on the dress. I have "hips" and this dress showed the hourglass figure off nicely. The size was perfect for my size 10/12. The seller worked with me on the return request.


Loved this dress


Can't beat the price! Love the sequined detail. I'm 5'9" and 140 pounds and the small fit well!


good


I received the dress shortly after ordering but unfortunately, the dress scratched my arms so bad while trying it on (less than 5 minutes) that I cannot imagine what it would do after wearing for an entire evening.
