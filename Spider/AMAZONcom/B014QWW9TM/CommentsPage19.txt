Gorgeous dress! I got it fast and it came with a little then shawl. No one else had anything similar at the adult prom I attended. It was a hit with so many compliments received from other attendees throughout the night


Beautiful dress!  Just a tad too small for my curves and bust line.  38DD and ordered a large.  Needed the dress right away so did not exchange.  Looks very expensive.  You won't be disappointed!!


I absolutely love this dress!!!! Wore it for a masquerade ball I had last month and I heard all night "I love your dress" it's definitely worth buying but it's a good idea to buy a size up and maybe get altered it was a little snug around the middle


This is a gorgeous dress. A bit too long for me (5'3")


Really sexy. I wear a medium. And the lace in the back helps.


I ordered a small. I'm 5'2 and wore 5 inch heels, and I weigh 110 lbs. Looked great on, but it was way too long and had to be hemmed even with heels. A little bigger than expected... I liked the lace-up back look, but I had to pull it in so much for it to stay up that you couldn't even really tell it was supposed to be a V-shaped lace up pattern. The edges almost touched at the top and were touching at the bottom with still too much slack around the waist.


my daughter wore this to military ball and it was beautiful.  what a great dress.  looks amazing on.


I am looking forward to wearing this somewhere.  A bit over the top for me but I like how it flatters my shape, which is a size 14.  Probably for New Years' Eve!


Beautiful dress, color and shape are exactly as pictured. Order a size up.


very impressed with the quality of this product - great value for the price. the sequin detailing is beautiful and I was afraid the fabric would be thin and see-through but it's not at all. My only complaint is it's a small in the chest area but it's partially my own chest being too large. Corset allows for plenty of adjustment. Came in just a couple days.
