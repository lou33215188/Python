I am 5'4" and 145 pounds. I normally wear a size 8 dress and I ordered a size 8. It fit perfectly.  I won't be able to wear very high heels, maybe a kitten heel, but the length is OK .


I bought this dress for my maid of honor and it is PERFECT! The only down side is I ordered a size 8 and they sent a size 10 so its a little big in the breast (36A) So if it can't be altered I will have to exchange it.


My bridesmaids looked amazing. You canâ€™t get any better for the price.


This looked awesome on my daughter-in-law; she wore it for her cousins wedding as a Bridesmaid and she was the prettiest one


Runs about a size or two small, but great value and quality.  Wish they had plus size options for further selection.


Buy this dress! I'm a 12/14 (closer to a 12) bought this dress for a wedding I was in, it was perfect! It comes folded and very wrinkled, took an hour on low heat to iron, but it came out beautifully. I would recommend this dress over and over again. If I find myself needing a formal dress this is where I'll get it. Shipping was fast.


The only thing was the strap slipped off, it was big but I never got around to pinning it. My husband threw it in the washer after the wedding and it came out fine. I'll stuff it in my closet and hopefully wear it again one day. The sweetheart neckline is so beautiful.


I got these dresses for my bridesmaids and they are very nice and good quality. Back zipper part is hard to zip if you don't get the right size I recommend go a size up. But I really loved these ğŸ‘— dresses.


I wanted to like it, but the bottom is completely see-through so expect to wear a slip.  (ordered in white)  Also, I have a bust of 42, ordered a 14 per their size chart and it's still too large.


Very pretty dress.  We ordered dress too small and have to have alterations done but looks great on.  Would recommend having larger sizes available.


Im Very surprised of this dress for the price! I was worried it wouldn't look like the picture but it does. Very pretty.
