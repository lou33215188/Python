Dress is nice but the material for the flowers is floppy making it look tacky and it's not true to size. I am typically a 14 16 in dresses I ordered a 16 and it doesn't zip around my bust and comes to my lower calf instead of being floor length like the picture


Great quality for a good price. The fit was great, except for the length. I'm 5'7" and will have to get 3 inches taken off the bottom. Other than that, I'm happy as a clam!


The dress looks nice in the picture however it is EXTREMLY poorly made!! The floral shoulder strap broke 30 minutes after being in the dress


Beautiful dress!!! I love it! I'm a size 4 and it fits me perfectly!!!! Can't wait to wear it in the Carribean later this month on our cruise!!!


about 2 sizes to small. wish it was avaibable in a larger size. really pretty and well made


The product was exactly as I expected, gorgeous! The fabric is good quality for formal wear.  Very prompt delivery!


Beautiful dress! Wonderful quality


The dress is beautiful and the same as it looks, but I have problems with closing, it does not work very well and I have to force it.


My only complaint with this dress is that it came pretty wrinkled, other than that, it was perfect!


I am under 5' 1" and weigh about 115 so I purchased the smaller size. This dress was too long but I hemmed it and took the shoulder strap up to make it fit. Loved it and people had no idea I got it cheap! Great purchase!
