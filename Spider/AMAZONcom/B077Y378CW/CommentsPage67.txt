Absolutely love this gown.  Great fit and very comfy. Got it as for a New Year's Eve Ball.


My jr brides are in high school and needed a dress FAST since the other amazon retailer from China failed to send their dresses. And they LOVE THEM! Excellent buy!


It was larger in the bust than stated. The sweetheart neckline is sewn pretty cheeky and won't lay properly.


It needs boning and to reset the neckline, but not too bad for the price. Know you'll need to spend an additional  $75 to 100 on fixing it but that still makes it a kind of cheep dress.


I love this dress, since I'm busty I decided  to go up a size just to be safe and it was good that I did! I still had a little wiggle room but enough that I could slip in and out of the dress !


Fit exactly to size chart, is beautiful and excellent quality. Love this dress. Thank you so much!


QuedÃ³ perfecto.
