Perfecto


The dress is very think and somewhat see thru, the flowers are not attached strong enough so even by the time it arrived some fell out. I have a special event that I need this color for, otherwise I would return it.


i will not wear it until July for my sister wedding.


I looked very pretty in this dress. looks like an expensive dress


This was a great dress as I was in a pinch to find something! My only complaint was that some of the flowers on the strap fell off after wearing it only a few hours. If you buy this dress I would recommend putting a few extra stitches in those embellishments before wearing.


How it fits....


I'm 5'9, 220 pounds and wear a size 16 or Large shirt/XL bottoms. Bra size is 38DDD or 40DD. I had to pull up the dress often and the bust area was a tad loose, but not enough to go down a size.


I suggest having it altered if you're in a wedding party.


I ordered 2 other dresses, one a size up and one in 16W(rather than 16R) and I did not like those. This one was just better all around, and I don't think I would have like the other two even if they were the right size


Here are the other dresses I ordered:


I am 5'5 and I normally wear a size 14.  I had to order a size 12 in this style.


Excellent dress for the price!


Once they actually sent me the right dress it was wonderful! Fits great looks beautiful! It looks exactly like the picture.


It was everything as expected.


It's nice.
