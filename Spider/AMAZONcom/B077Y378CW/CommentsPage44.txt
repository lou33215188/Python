The dress is really nice.  The only thing was the upper part of the dress it was a little to big. I based my size on the size scale and it was a little too big. But regardless the dress was beautiful, I received many compliments on the dress.


Beautiful


I LOVE this dress. The size 8 is the perfect fit for my 5'4"/148 pound frame. Built in bra in bodice area. Comfortable and flattering. No need for tailoring as the length is perfect. I am taking off one star because the dress, from just below the bodice to the floor, is entirely  sheer in the white color I purchased. You will need to wear a full length slip if you want to retain your modesty.  I also purchased in the royal blue and that color is not sheer so I will be wearing the blue. I love the floral strap. It brings a ladylike flirtiness to the dress.


You get what you pay for.  I am tall (5' 10", and of course will wear heels) and just wanted to test this brands length.  I had to return the dress because it was way too short for me.


Beautiful dress! Bought this as a bridesmaid dress and it fits well (a tad large in the bust but nothing that is the dress's fault ;). Color matched great with picture shown, very happy with quality, purchase price was right in my budget so I couldn't be happier!


Beautiful dress! Will definitely buy from this seller again.


Loved it


Gown fit like a dream! I just needed to hem it


The dress fits exactly as i t should and looks exactly like the picture. Very flowy and lightweight, double layer dress. The bodice has some structure to it so it sits well on my hips and I don't think I will need to wear a bra under it.


Love it, it fits perfectly and looks amazing. Used it for my baby shower.
