Beautifully made, just 2 sizes too small.


Tight in back area and not enough bust support and extra long. Would have to have it altered.


Beautiful! I couldn't believe the quality of the dress considering the low price. I wear a 10/12 in jeans so I ordered the 12 and it fit perfect! Would highly recommend it.


First off the dress is gorgeous!! I am 5'8" and 130 with a 36 bust and it fits great!! Fast shipping and seems like a great company to do buisness with.


  I gave it 4 our of 5 starts because I ordered the vermillion color and it seems more red than burgundy that the picture depicts. The tag and order check out so I am not sure why it appears more red in person than the picture. I am still going to wear it and dance the night away in it... in comfort! :)


Beautiful dress, fits as expected. Dress is a little long, (I'm 5'1) and with heels I was still stepping on it all night.  Otherwise the dress was perfect.


Dress was absolutely beautiful.. But to small. So sent back for refund.  Will purchase a different dress but get one size larger.  Sizes tend to run small.


Dress fits great. Fabric is great quality and comfortable to wear. My only negative is we ordered them for bridesmaids dresses and it appears that some sizes are made in different shades of blue. I am 5â€™2 so the dress is about 8 inches too long for me.


Now that my bridesmaid have flown in and tried on the dress it is way too big.  Can it be returned?


The material is very good but the color is a bit too dark. I return the dress after my friends think the tone make the dress looks old. Zipper is almost impossible to use.


160 pounds athletic build ordered size 10. Fit good. The quality is great.
