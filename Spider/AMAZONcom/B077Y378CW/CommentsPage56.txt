Fit slightly big but a size down would have been too small. Shipped quickly.


I overestimated the size, but still like the dress and it can be tailored to fit.


Just as pretty in person!


It's very pretty on me! It fits well in the waist. I may have to wear a padded bra to make sure it stays up on the one side.


Shipping and the dress was excellent


I love it.


For my GF, got this as a bridesmaid dress. How can you beat the price? The fit is perfect for my size, YMMV. It comes all wadded up in a tiny bag, so its ridiculously wrinkled. But less than 10 minutes with a steamer, and it looks like a million bucks!


I like the dress but it is too small. I think a lot of clothes now days are Jr. sizes. Will be sending it back.


This was a great purchase, the dress looks the same as on the picture, its a very nice dress for a wedding.


The fit was great too.


The dress is so beautiful. The color also. Is just a bit larger than me, but I'll fix it. I loved it.
