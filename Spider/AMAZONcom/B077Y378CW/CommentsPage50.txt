Wore this to my friend's outdoor wedding. Definitely a spring/summer dress. Nice and flowy. Steam on low heat with an iron. Follow the size guide. I'm usually a size 12, but got a 10 based on the size guide and it fit great!


Great dress excellent service

Really pretty. Color is great


It was way too small


Great buy. It's a lovely dress.


It arrived as promised & it fit perfect & it's beautiful. Thank you


i like this pretty dress but it's too small for the sizes. this is really for petite one most specially on the bustline. price not bad but I'm running out of time for the event so I'd rather exchange it.
