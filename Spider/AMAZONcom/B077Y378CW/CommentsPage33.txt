This dress fit to a T! It is exactly as pictured. I would definitely order from this seller again.


Perfect fit and exactly as it looks. I love how well this dress looks and how well put together it is for the price! I would order it in every color if I had somewhere to go that often.


I ordered these for my bridesmaids and we love them. I tried one on as soon as I got them and it is very comfortable. They are very long so I will need to get the two altered since my bridesmaids are very short.


Fit perfect - ordered for a last minute wedding gown.


At first I thought this would be a scam dress (lol whatever that may be ). The dress is perf! the only thing is the strap is a little loose but not wear it falls down my arm or anything but its a great dress and I'm happy I purchased it. This will enhance your beauty ladies, wonderful dress


Love the dress! It's a gorgeous royal blue. I'm 6' and it hit the floor perfectly to wear with flats (which was my intention).


Great quality for the price. Dress is exactly what is pictured.


It fits perfectly and I love the color.


It's perfect! Feels like snow white :)
