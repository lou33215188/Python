It's a pretty dress, and flattering, but the bra is huge.  I am using the dress as a second option for a different dress that is too small.


Flower strap too long and not enough support in bust.  Pretty for the price.


Love the dress! fits and it is pretty!!!


Perfect! Wore it with a veil and it was great!


This dress I love it so much it fix me really nice


It was a long dress (needed heels) but absolutely stunning.


Loved the dress and how fast it arrived. It did run big in the chest though


Too much padding on the chest area.


Is beautiful, it just didn't fight right on me


I'm hard to fit, but this dress was a great find.  It was comfortable and really cute.  It hid all my imperfections and flaws. I'd definitely buy it again!
