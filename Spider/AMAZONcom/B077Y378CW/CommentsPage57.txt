Nice dress and fit well


It's so beautiful but it was too big so I had to return it.


Beautiful dress. Sizes run bigger than expected.


This dress is gorgeous.  My daughter decided to change her wedding day that had been planned for summer, to February, giving us 4 weeks to plan!  She scaled back the wedding party to just a maid of honor.  This dress came quickly & is made better than any in the bridal shops that we had seen and it was just a  fraction of the cost!  The color is a deep, rich plum - just beautiful!!!  Definately a great find!

Very pretty! I love it


These dress is cute. it does however run a little small. I would say it runs one size too small. So whatever dress size you normally get go a size up.
