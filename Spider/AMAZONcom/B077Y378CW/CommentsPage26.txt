Amazing dress for my bridesmaids. Wish it was brighter or richer in mint. Overall great material, very well padded, extra layer to prevent being transparent. Long dress but it can be shorten, since I am having a summer wedding. I will post pics!


My daughter loved the dress, nice quality. I went by the size chart and measured my daughter but when it arrived it was way too small. Luckily I was able to return it very easily and ordered the next size up and it was perfect.


Great dress, very pretty and looks good on.


I ordered this a bit to large one thing to take in consideration when ordering the waist is free so you can order a size down seeing that the dress is an empire line, overall the dress is lovely.


We purchased this dress for my daughter to wear to homecoming, as she's pretty tall and not into the really short dresses that are in stores.  This dress fit perfectly, was at a perfect length for her 5'9" height, and was extremely comfortable.  I can't believe the value of this dress and would highly recommend it.


My daughter got great reviews about the dress ...she and others were extremely happy with the results. Way to go Amazon!


I am a size 16 but wear a size 36g bra so I ordered one size up for the bust. it was too big so i would order a 16 because it is true to size in that respect. I am also 5'9" and this dress is too short for me before I put on any sort of heel. I will be returning it.


It is a beautiful gown for the holidays.


Love this dress. i was a bridesmaid in a wedding this summer. this dress came in fast and it fit perfect. i would say just order a size up to be safe and the dress was beautiful


Quality of the dress is nice but the sizing is WAY off I wear normally a 2-4 (first time bought a 4 then an 8) and I'm buying for my third chance a 12.
