Absolutely beautiful! Bought these dresses last minute for my bridesmaids after having problems with Esty. They shipped very fast, came on time and my girls looked absolutely beautiful! The dresses are soo comfortable and they all kept them and plan on wearing them again :) Also, they were very slimming!!


I bought this for an army ball. I was 5 months pregnant. Only complaint...breast fit on the large side. Baby bump made it an ankle length. Color was amazing. Will save it and have it taken in for next army ball!


Fits perfect, it looks just like the photo, true to the color in the picture. Great dress and great price, it looks much more expensive than the price.


Got a size 6 at 5'8/9" 135, and it fit well. I wore 3 inch heels. If it was longer it would have still been okay


Great dress, especially for the price but order at least one size bigger than you need


This is NOT what I ordered! I’m not sure if they thought I wouldn’t notice the difference but clearly what’s being advertised is a one strap dress.  Buyer beware.


My daughter picked this dress for me to wear at her wedding, almost same dress as the one I tried on in the store. Took a chance on buying online and glad I did.


I like it!


It's fantastic! It fits perfectly with my bust and then drapes wonderfully. I'm shorter than average, and it only hangs a little bit on the floor; this may be trouble for a taller person. The shoulder strap was a bit long like other reviews mentioned.


Fast shipping! Good quality! Just as pictured
