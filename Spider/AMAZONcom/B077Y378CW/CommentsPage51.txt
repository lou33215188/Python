Fit nicely and material was great


I went by the chart that was shown with the dress, and when I got the dress it was to small.


This dress fits perfect. The size I ordered is absolutely amazing and I'm even left with wiggle room to be comfortable. Love love love it!


Beautiful dress! My bridesmaids love them and so do I! Will definitely order again and recommend Ever Pretty!


I bought this dress for my daughters high school military ball and it is beautiful!  The dress fits true to size, and the pic does it no justice.


Beautiful dress:) well made. I typically wear a 14 but got a 16 and with a few alterations this will be a great reception dress.


Wonderful dress material looks a bit cheap though.


The dress is very nice and loved the color, I chose a size that would fit my waist, and it end up being too big on the bust. Had to return it, but otherwise the dress is well made and beautiful. Ordered another model that is more flattering on me but fits me better. Just received it and really like it.
