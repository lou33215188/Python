Dress as pretty as it looked online, I was impressed. Color as shown online also..... Love it.  Dress was delivered earlier than expected ğŸ˜Š.  Fabric and made was not top but good, esp. For the price... Can't beat that!


It came sooner than expected and it fit perfectly.


I had my bridesmaids order this dress for our October wedding and they were beautiful! They do need some alteration,  but that's pretty normal for a wedding.  The dress is a bit see through,  so you will need a slip. It is a great price for a bridesmaid dress.  Overall,  I was very happy.


Needed this for a gala I volunteered at. It fit pretty true to size and looked great! I have ordered several dresses from Ever Pretty since this one and continue to be satisfied. With Prime they get here fast and many are free returns.


Overall it's very beautiful dress~ I am 5.5 " and 117lb I bought a size 4 , it fits me well . The color is pretty as I expected. The only thing makes me give a 4 star is the flower on the shoulder is not standing up~ I would just use my hair to cover a little bit!


I wore this as a bridesmaid dress for a friend's wedding and it was lovely. My only comppaint is that the strap wasn't attached too securely and almost ripped off the front of the dress. But that was easily fixed. It's a really great dress at a nice price.


Didnâ€™t fit as sized.


I normally don't write reviews but this dress deserves it! Fit my bridesmaids as expected! Very happy with this purchase!


This dress fit just as expected according to the measurements given in the chart and is made very well. Given the price I half expected it to be cheaply made however to my surprise it is made very well and even better then dresses two and three times its price. I would highly recommend it.


Zise fit me ok, but too long Im 5"4.


Ordered zise 4, good quality of fabrics.


Im happy with my it. Recommended
