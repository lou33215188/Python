Beautiful Dress


I had to have the strap altered because it kept sliding off my shoulder but other than that I love love the dress .. Got a lot of compliments


Dress is beautiful and would love to wear but it came with a huge ink stain. will have to return


Loved it! Yes-it was a little to long but the specs had the length detail. Really happy with the quality and fit of the dress!!!!


I purchased the purple dress for a formal ball. I ordered Thursday evening and it arrived as stated by Saturday even in the awful snow storms stalking the northeast. The color is SO rich and beautiful; exactly as pictured. I used the provided size chart and the dress fits PERFECTLY. Not as long as I would like though. I'm 5'9" and usually wear 4" heels however without shoes this dress is just barely touching the ground. For once I'll wear short heels. I have a small chest (36B) and I can wear without a bra yet still look kinda busty. Overall I am very pleased!


it's long for me, but it's a beautiful dress, very elegant. the color is exactly as the picture.


totally worth it


Beautiful dress just to big in the bust area, love the strap and the lightness of the dress and the flow
