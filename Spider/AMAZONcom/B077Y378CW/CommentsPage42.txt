It is actually really great for the price and it came in a plastic bag!!!


Love the dress it is true to size. I am disappointed in how it was packaged. It came extremely wrinkled.


Bust area is smaller than expected


Nice dress, but not true to size. Had to order 2 sizes bigger than my actual size.


Love this dress fits like a glove. Came early also !


I ordered this dress on a whim for my beach elopement. I was skeptical at first to order it because of the cheap price.  But I am so glad I did because the dress fits and looks stunning!


The material is sheer so a slip is needed.


Everything I was looking for!


I love it. Fit in me perfectly!!! Happy.


Very pretty dress and the colors are spot on. The size runs a little big but just a little. The ony complaint I have is that from the waist down is very thin which makes is see through. You definitely need a slip under it. Hope this helps!


love it the colour just right and I know it will look good for the perfect occasion am wearing it for


Thanks
