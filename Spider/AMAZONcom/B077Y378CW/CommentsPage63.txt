Fits perfect. Bridesmaid dress, we love it! Beautiful in person!! We just have to hem the bottom and it is exactly what we asked for


Too big for me


Beautiful dress.


Great dress very well made


The fabric was more stretchy than anticipated, & the zipper a little weak, however with a padded bra & gentle handling, it will work great!


It's to small over all it's a nice dress.  is there a way send it back?


Dress is lovely, but the bust was too large.


i love the dress color


I am very unhappy with this dress. B I will never order another one again


it is really beautiful dress and can't wait to wear for my best friend's wedding...
