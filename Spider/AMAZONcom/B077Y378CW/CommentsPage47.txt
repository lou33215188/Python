its lighter than the color of the pic


Loved it!


Up


Ordered the size according to measurement chart for bust only since free waist and hip.  Fit perfect.


Dress was more than I expected very pretty well made. Would buy from vendor again


just not very impressed with the quality of the dress.


true to size


Love this dress! Great material and fast shipping


It's beautiful! I am 5'9, 145 lbs and I got a size 6, it fits just right around the bust. The length just grazes the floor so sandals will be a good choice for a more casual look as I have no one particular event for this dress. The coral color is summery, And I can't wait to wear this to dinner with the hubs!


Fit perfectly. However, cut it off above the knew.
