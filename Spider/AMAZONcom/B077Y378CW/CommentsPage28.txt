Very comfty and the color was exactly as espected. I love it!!


I have to admit I was nervous ordering a dress online, but I couldn't pass up the price on this dress. I took my own measurements and compared them to the size chart given by the company and it was perfect all the way around!


Great for what I needed it for


Happily surprised with the quality and fit of this dress, considering the price. Quality is great, color is true to color as pictured, and fits like a glove. Very flattering on. Great product.


It was perfect for the even used, The size was just as it was suppose to be.  It was very thin, so in the quality you get what you pay for.


Beautiful


Returned it.  Was too large in the bust for me;  needed a size smaller.  Fabric was pretty and color was as described, but I didn't care for the flowery part;  just didn't flatter me.


Excellent quality of fabric for the price, however.


Wonderful dress to wear!  Perfect fit and perfect time for a wedding.


True to size and fits like a glove! I'm 5'7" and ordered this in a size 4, I won't need to get it altered, taken in, or hemmed. Good quality, flattering, and a well made dress! Highly recommend it! Shipped and arrived within 7 days!


I got a 10. I'm 5,5ft. It fits perfect. Good Quality.
