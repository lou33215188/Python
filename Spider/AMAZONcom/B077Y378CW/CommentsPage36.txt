I got so many compliments on this dress. My photographer thought I paid a lot of money for it, said it looked really expensive!


Good value n cute dress


My maid of honor was very pleased her dress was affordable and fits her perfectly


I'm so Happy.  These dresses are gorgeous and I couldn't be happier.


Gorgeous dress. I usually wear a size 10 but this dress runs a size small. The 8 was perfect!


Love the fit everywhere except the bust. I'm a size 8 but had to get a 10 so I wasn't falling out.


Great dress! Fits just a little snug but I like when my clothes are fitted. Very flattering and seems well made.


Love the dress for my bridesmaid


Perfect for prom and fit perfectly.  The quality was wonderful for the price and the dress arrived promptly - love it!
