I had to buy a size ten when I have a size 6 or 4 because they were not available.  Otherwise a pretty dress on and seems to work with any size body.  Purchased for a bridesmaid dress


bought this for my MOH as my bridal theme was eggplant, she looked beutiful in it!


I had previously ordered a dress from a different online website and the dress arrived late and was badly sewn. THIS company however saved my ass. Thank you so much. I cannot express to you how happy I am. Thank god for Ever-Pretty!


Very pretty dress


Material is good and dress is really pretty but runs too small


This dress is amazing , I'm am 135lbs and 5'2 this dress is not extra long so being short that's great ! It got here so fast . But there is nothing bad about this great price perfect dress true to size and color !â�¤ï¸�


Ver y elegant


Fits me perfecty! I'm 5'2 and a bodybuilder so my I'm on the muscular side. You don't understand the struggle that is formal wear when you a short female bodybuilder. I'm not huge (I compete in the smallest division of bodybuilding for women: bikini).


Wore for a bridesmaids dress loved it!!


I measured EXACTLY for the size 10.  But when I tried it on it was so big at the top that I wouldn't even be able to take it to be altered.  I'm exchanging it for a size smaller.  Other than the size being completely wrong with the measurements, I really do love the dress.
