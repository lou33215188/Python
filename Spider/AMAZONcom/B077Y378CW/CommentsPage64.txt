I was highly disappointed! After five minutes of wearing this dress (MY WEDDING DRESS) the strap pops and the flowers fall off! On a day that is already intense and stressful, I had to worry if my breast was going to pop out while I'm walking down the aisle. I demand a refund for this terrible made dress!!!
