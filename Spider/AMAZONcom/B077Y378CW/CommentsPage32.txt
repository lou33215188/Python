True to size! Beautiful dress! Inperchased this as a bridesmaids dress and am beyond happy!!


i love it!


Stunning!!


It is see through but other than that it is a beautiful dress.  size 14 is about a size 38 D bust.  I am 5'5" and the dress is a bit long but I have heels that solved the problem.


Well worth the money. This is a high quality end dress for a fraction of the price.


I absolutely loved this dress. It did fit a little tight so be sure to double check the measurements.


Fits beautifully. Definitely made for tall women but doesn't bother me. :)  love it!!
