fit perfect. a bit too long but expected as I am only 4'10".


It is very beautiful and elegant dress. Plus the price is fair. I loved it


Here's my daughter's review: Ladies here's the real deal with this dress. It's well made and the top is especially charming and flattering to the figure. The bottom of the dress is see thru especially in White so be prepared to wear a slip but that is no big deal at this amazing price. I have worked out the size issue. If you are small busted order the dress in your size and it will fit. If you modest bosom size( c cup) go by the size chart use the chest measurement. If you are VERY VERY busty and a 38inch or more go two sizes up and just prepare yourself to have the dress altered a few inches, better too big than too small. I wear a size 12. I initially ordered the 10 based on reviews that the top was bigger on most. Well my girls(38 D) would not fit at all. I exchanged it for the 14 and it fits (almost) I will need to have about 2 inches taken off for a perfect fit. I might have to take off more if I lose more weight before my beach wedding. Terrific dress, if it needed no slip it would be 5 stars for me. I feel like a princess!.


Nice dress exactly as the picture..


Pretty dress, sizing was somewhat difficult. Loose on some parts, long and definitely needs to be altered. But minor problems that could be fixed easily. Still a great dress for the price.


The dress was for my mother who uses size 6-8 I bought size 8 and it didn't fit her. The dress it's pretty and well made. But you shoul go a I size  up just in case.


Worth every penny. Fits great..
