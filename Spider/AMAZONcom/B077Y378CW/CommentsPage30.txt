The dress is well made and fit well except for the bust where I found it to be a bit big on the strapless side. Otherwise it was true to size. I ended up returning it though because the pale pink color I ordered was a bit too see through for me. I'm sure it would be lovely in a darker color.


Material looks cheap, so rerurned the item.


But I guess for the price paid, it's not too bad.


It did fit as expected. It was just too large. My height is 5' 6" and it is also some heavy, but it is nice. Well made.


Good material color is correct but at airport one shoulder is to high & right.  Not comfortable for my height 4’7””


It was a prefect dress for my friends wedding. It is very long for my stature so I had to hem it but it's gorgeous


It fits as expected! Very pretty dress. Will use it for my cousin's wedding. The only problem for me is, it's much too long. I am however only 5'2


Beautiful dress! Does run small order it 2 sizes up!


Very small on me. Was extremely disappointing since it was such a cute dress


Built in support sales this dress for a formal evening. If you need a nice formal but don't want a major investment look into this line. I will be back if I need another dress for a different season.


I only followed the bust measurements because the rest is loose fitting, ordered size 12 because I wear a 36/38 bra and it fit really well. I am 5'7 and it is a couple inches too long, perfect for wearing heels
