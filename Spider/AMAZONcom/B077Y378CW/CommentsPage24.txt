I loved this dress, I got this for a very important party and the dress looked very good on my shape. I have hips but it flowed over and hung just right and I didn't have to hem it at all. That is a plus


My granddaughter's prom dress! She was SO pleased, excellent quality for a small price!


Much better quality than I expected! Fits perfectly--follow their chart. Great look for bridesmaid's dress. Length may be a bit long for 5'3 size 6, I may have to get it hemmed.


5ft, 4inches. Ordered a size 8. A size 6 would have fitted too. Long, flowing dress. Beautiful design. Falls elegantly. Ordered in the color vermillion. Beautiful, rich, red color!


Received this dress within 5days. The color is exactly the image displayed. I ordered a 6 and it fit perfect. I wear a 36/D so I'm a little broad for the top to zip up but it still works. Comes with great support and built in bra. My waist is a 29 and it sits nicely on the waist. I'm 5'8 with heels on and the dress is right above the floor.


This dress was for my mom, and it fit her perfectly


LOVE this!! It fits great, and is beautiful material. It is going to be perfect for an upcoming wedding.


These were the dresses that my bridesmaids wore at my wedding. We ordered 3 altogether and everybody loved the shape, color and fabric. The length is a bit short, so if you're taller than 5 ft 6 in, it's probably going to fall around your ankles and not floor length. My bridesmaids didn't really mind this though.


LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS FIT PERFECTLY can't wait to wear at my lake front wedding ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�
