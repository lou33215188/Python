Love the color and fits perfectly. The size chart is legit! ğŸ˜‰


I am 5'2" 196lbs and 6 months pregnant. I ordered a size 14 and it fits fine. I love this dress and it was affordable for my intimate wedding ceremony.


I like the dress, is good quality and the color it is strong vibe, the picts provide are for bridesmaid with different shape


I had somewhat low expectations for this dress because of the cost and not being able try it on/see if beforehand. But I was highly impressed with the quality and sizing (true to sizing chart). I highly recommend this dress for bridesmaid dresses, prom, or military ball (what I purchased it for)!


This gown is just that!  I didn't follow the instructions when ordering and looked at the wrong sizing chart so the dress is too large for me in the bust.  I think I will order the smaller size instead of going through alterations.  But back to the dress.  The purple color is lovely, the draping is very slimming and the length will be fine with heels.  Thank you!


This dress is gorgeous for the price you pay. It's perfect for prom, a formal, or even a bridesmaid. But! Measure yourself against the chart provided. I had to jump up three sizes to find the right fit.


Also I want to let you guys know that if you select size 10 and it says Junior, disregard that. It's a typo, it's a women's size 10. I checked with the seller.


I am a size 16 and it fit true to size!! It is absolutely gorgeous and elegant. I felt like a goddess in it! The nude color is very classy


I love it so much I bought a new one in a larger size. I think I maybe was too positive. I am usually size 6 or 8 and I bought a 6. But it is way too small. I bought a new one and it's 10. Hope this one fits.


They dress is beautiful. However, it fits too small. I would get a size larger than your normal size.


Definitely size up, but this dress was actually really beautiful! I wore it to a wedding last month and got so many compliments that I'm wearing it to another one this month because it is with different people. The material and fit were great, especially for the price. Only thing is that it is a little long, so you might want to give yourself enough time to possible get it altered before you wear it.
