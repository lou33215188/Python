Excellent fit, this dress fits true to size I'm definitely using this vendor again...


Perfect and at an amazing price!


Love it!


Beautiful, nice fitting dress. Comfortable material. Item delivered on time and was as described.


Nice dress but tooooo small


The dress is really pretty and fit very well.  The top gathered bust area was a little bit off but nothing that isn't fixable I hope.


I found the size 6 to actually be the measurements that the seller said were for the size 8. The size 6 fit beautifully. I normally wear a 2 or 4, depending on the brand.


Lovely dress I brought it for my bridesmaid and she loved it.


Perfect


Perfect dress for my wedding.  Dont hesitate to buy it at all
