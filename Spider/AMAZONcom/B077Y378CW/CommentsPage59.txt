Very pretty


This is a beautiful dress and it was a great fit.  I purchased this dress in size 16 for my niece to wear to the prom.


It is a nice dress.  The only problem is you can see through the dress.


The dress is beautiful, A little dissappointed, I put the dress on and some of the beads fell off the dress


A little see-through. But really pretty and really good value for the price!


Beautiful after alterations for resizing


I ordered this dress at the last minute for a wedding. I figured if it works great, if not I'll wear a standby.I'm 5' 10" and was worried that it might be a little short but it was fine. It fit well and was beautiful! I got so many compliments the whole night. I purchased this dress at $59.00 and two days later the price dropped to $39.00 (not sure why). In any event, I loved it so much that when I saw the price drop I bought two more in forest green and the sapphire blue!


it was too big for me


I really love it !!!


Really nice dresse for my bridesmaids!
