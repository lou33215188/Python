i choose this rating because we measure the body and with those measures we choose the size, but the dress is bigger


Beautiful dress! Love it especially for the price.


Beautiful dress. I loved it, just waiting for the size 8 to see if it fits perfect.


I ordered this strapless dress and got a completely different one in the mail. Very disappointed


Very beautiful dress for the price! I am 5'1 and weigh 105, and the size 4 fit perfect. It was a little long but with heels it turned out fine :)


Wrinkly, cheap, ill-fitting


Great dress for the price. Great quality! Fit true to size


Dress very pretty and well made, great price. I thought it may be too large and it was which was the reason for the return. Return process very easy and refund came quickly. Very satisfied with process of ordering and returning.


The dress is beautiful and will be perfect for the wedding renewal ceremony


After ordering 2 other dresses and returning them, this one finally fit.  It is still a little snug for a size 10 though.  It is very pretty but VERY LONG.  I had to alter it so that I could wear it.  I am 5'2" but still I must have cut at least 6 inches or more off of it!
