IT really is a beautiful dress! Great price as well! :)


the shoulder strap kept falling off my shoulder, but overall a beautiful dress. Got lots of compliments. Wore this to the Mom Prom ( a mother/son dance).


It was beautiful!


The dress is nice  for the price even the fabric is beautiful. The problem was In have to fix the length for my hight and to adjust the bust a little bit. I usually wear size 6 petite, the dress was 8, but again, for the price it is OK


Dress is very beautiful


This dress is gorgeous!  Very well made, doesn't look cheap at all. And true to the size! Would Definitely order again if I had another special occasion for it


Very beautiful dress! Color came just as expected! Love it!! Very fast shipping.


Beautiful color, sheer thin however it fits as I expected. I have ex large hips and a small waist. The hips are "FREE" which allows me to wear a smaller size. Will take a picture and post later.


This dress was amazing!!! It fit perfectly and I received so many complements!!! Everyone told me I looked stunning!!! I am a bigger girl and this dress is very slimming! Couldn't be happier!!!


Make sure to grab a size or two smaller because this dress runs big. I usually would wear a 16, but the 12 fit perfect!


It was the color that it showed and that I was looking for and wanted! Fits just I thought it would and am looking forward to being a bridesmaid in it!! :D
