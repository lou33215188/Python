Gorgeous dress. Perfect fit. We'll made.


Very lovely drees am satisfied


I can't believe how high quality this dress was for how much it cost. I am 5'7" and 150 lbs and the size 6 fit me perfectly. It was the perfect length to wear with flats. You do not need to wear a bra with this dress. It was completely opaque and the cut is very flattering. The green is a very pretty dark emerald color. The dress was very wrinkly when it came out of the package and trying to steam it in the bathroom while I showered didn't help. I had to iron it on a low setting.


My one minor complaint is that the fabric is pretty static-y.


Love my dress


I'm 5'7 - so I wish it was a little longer. Material is thin, but it worked perfect for me. I actually wore this as my second dress on our wedding day. Got married on a beach in key west. Changed into this dress later in the evening. Wrinkles from shipping came out easily with a hand held steamer.


Fit well


I found these for my brides maids and they were true to color and close to size but still fit a little small.. remember you always want to order bigger and always have it taken up to fit perfect


ALL IN ALL A GREAT DRESS FOR THE MONEY


Very Pretty but the flowers on the strap started falling off the first time I wore it. I can fix it, no problem, but it was annoying! The dress is still beautiful!


I bought this dress for a charity gala in white size 2. I am 5'4 and 110 pounds and length/fit were perfect. I purchased this dress with the intentions of removing the strap as it is not my style. I had great success removing it and sewing on lace ribbon on each side of the dress for straps and it turned out great.  I recommend this dress, especially for the value.


After the alterations in the bust area because it to big  the dress looks great. The dress was cool light weight perfect for all your summer events
