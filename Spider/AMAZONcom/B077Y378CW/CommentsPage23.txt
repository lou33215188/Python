Beautiful dress!


Dress was purchased for my daughter who is in a wedding.  Style and color chosen by the bride.


Great fit. Got a size larger and fits great. It came super wrinkled but was able to get it wrinkle free.


I bought this dress (size 8) to wear to my cousin's wedding. It blended perfectly with her theme. I had to do some adjustments (take in) to the bust, nonetheless, the dress was gorgeous and flattering. It is exactly as depicted in the photo.  I really like how it fits, and


I would recommend this dress.


Beautiful! 2nd dress I bought from Ever Pretty. Super long but then again I'm 5'1".


These look like they are floor length, but they aren't. they really go to above your ankle, so we are having them hemmed above the knee. Other than the length, they are very pretty and good quality.


Fits as expected and looked beautiful on my daughter


Love this dress! I'm older and I wore it to a high school prom as a chaperone. The students dug it and my co-workers did as well! While I was walking to the prom from my parking spot, I received a lot of compliments from strangers! It was a little big ( I ordered a 10) I should have ordered an 8 or 6.


Email dress maker to ensure proper sizing.  Wore for a wedding. Perfect. Cheap and cheerful.


wow! too amazing and so cheap! love it!
