It was a little late but it fit perfect very true to size!


I ordered this dress in coral for my six bridesmaids and they are perfect


Love this dress!!


The dress was too small for me. The 3star was a combination of the next day delivery and the quality of the dress.


I used it for a bridesmaid dress, I am 5'7" and typically wear an 8-10. I was nervous about buying online but this worked amazing and the color is beautiful. Got a size 10, it worked well but may have gotten an 8.


Beatifull


Fit perfectly. Very beautiful dress with good quality.


Poor quality, didnt fit, poor customer service and impossible to exchange since they charged over $50 just to ship back. I now have two useless dresses in my closet.


Nice and sample, but darker.


The dress is PERFECT. I NEED TO ORDER 4 MORE DRESSES
