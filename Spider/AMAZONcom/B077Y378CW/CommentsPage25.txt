I am 5'7 160 and this size 12 ran large in the bust and shoulder strap- the bottom was great and just touched the floorI had it altered and it looks great!


Love this dress the quality is good


Gorgeous dress!!! My size is 8 and it fits perfect! This is my first time to comment on the Amazon bc it's soooo impressively beautiful!! The dress is kinda long so you might need to wear high heels


Made the mistake of ordering too large thinking it runs small. But no, the chart is accurate. The look is elegant and amazing. Nobody will believe the price. Simply outstanding!


Loved it good quality


Very nice dress fit great.


Very nice quality dress for an excellent price! Was purchased for Jr/Sr prom and was perfect! Well made and a beautiful fit and flow.


Not top of the line quality - but for what you pay it's great! I have a shorter torso so the shoulder strap was slightly loose, but I was easily able to sew it a bit tighter. Looks great, very flattering if trying to hide unwanted stomach bulge.


I really love this dress! I never bought clothes online before, but after opening my package it amazed me with the quality and simple it is. We were looking for bridesmaid dresses and we would recommend these.


It was cute, just wasn't what I'm looking for
