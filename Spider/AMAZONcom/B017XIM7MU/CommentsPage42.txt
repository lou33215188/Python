Arms are a bit small and it bunches in the front over your chest


Beautiful dress. Love it !


Perfect!  I ordered one size larger and it is perfect.


Beautiful!!! Great price.


The color was not purple it was wine or burgundy. The purple does not look the same in person. The dress is great, I was sent the wrong color.


Quality of the material is fabulous but the top was way to tight. I ordered an extra large and normally wear a petite large.


Fit perfectly! I'm short and chubby, so that's hard to find in long dresses. I wore this to a wedding and got a lot of compliments.


Like the dress.


I love this dress! I followed others advice and got a size bigger than I normally wear. The quality is surprisingly good and keeps you warm.


Will order a smaller size. It's a bit long (I'm 5'4") so I may have to hem. This dress is beautiful!!! Lots of material! Very dressy especially for a seasonal concert performance--it is perfect!
