The neck is not as low as depicted, but that is fine with me.  Gorgeous color and well made. Slightly tight in arms.  Flows well I got many compliments.


This dress is very well made and fit perfectly


I bought this in berry as burgundy is my favorite color. It looks great! I may have it hemmed a little. I'm 5'2" so that's to be expected. I feel like it will be perfect for a semi formal event I have coming up.


Just love this dress

WHAT A DRESS IS LOOKS PERFECT

Beautiful dress for the cost. It fit my daughter perfectly.


Clothes fit well on me, Asian sizing was so wrong! Went three sizes up, still too tight. Returned.
