Amazing quality! It's luxurious material, sizes match well. I ordered a small, 5'5-135 pound. I have a bigger chest (36DD) so I reordered the medium. If your tata's are averagw size for your body, go with your regular size


I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't exactly look like the picture here.  It looks like it has satin around the neckline, but it doesn't  Neckline is higher than expected.  But for the price, I will keep it.  It is pretty and soft.


I ordered a size 2x, because I knew from other posts that the sizes run small.  I would normally take an extra large in misses' but the 2x fits well, and I am glad I knew that before I chose a size.


Problem #1:  I ordered this in black and instead was sent the bright royal blue.  Problem #2:  my daughter says it looks nice if I want to play a Disney princess in a movie.  She's right.  On a positive note:  this is a really comfortable dress and I think it would work well on a lot of body types because the style and fabric are forgiving.  So give it a try!  I am returning this bright blue dress but I think for some people it would be a great dress at a good price.


Would have given 5 stars if the sizing would have been correct. Beautiful dress! I'm a xxl large and the sleeves were too tight. Was able to return for a full refund.


I mostly liked it, but it didn't seem to 'hang' quite right. Plus it was a bit too large. (I'm 5' 9 and 170 lbs)


This is a beautiful dress. The velvet is beautiful and washes well. The fit was perfect. I ordered it in two other colors.


Beautiful green dress.  May order in wine.


The color was wrong bought for daughter's wedding. The size was somewhat small, very high waisted. Dress was very soft but returned it.


I really wanted to like this, but its very long and felt like a night gown when wearing. I'm 5'2" and it dragged on the floor even with heels. Pretty dress and soft material, fit well otherwise. Sorry I had to return it.
