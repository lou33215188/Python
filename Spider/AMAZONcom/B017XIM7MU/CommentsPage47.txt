It's a bit too large. Material is great.


Came when said.  Looks beautiful. Very soft velvet.


Love it!  Fit me well all over!


Great dress for that right occasion


The color was beautiful and it looked exactly as I imagined from the photo! Very comfortable too.


Runs VERY small in the top and arms.  Ordered the XL.  Bra size 38DD.


Great quality and very slimming.


Beautiful color and quality. - little large. I am 5'5" 145Ibs and I ordered a medium and it was big in the waist, otherwise it was great!


I love this dress, I'd ordered the Royal Blue & the Purple, I was expecting less but (WOW!), sizing is perfect, color is perfect. Thank you!!


DONT BUY! Looks like a dress from my grandmothers closet,
