Beautiful


I went up a size, and it fit very well. I received many complements, I can't believe what a good buy this is!


I didn't like the dress. The dress was delivered with a big hole in it.


Beautiful dress for the price. Soft and stretchy. Very elegant heavy velvet with a wonderful sheen.  Very excited to wear it to a semi-formal Christmas party.


The dress was a bit small in the bust for me and much to heavy for an Oct. wedding. I did have to return it.


Fits well in shoulders and arms, but the waist was waaay to large.


I am 5'2'' and 130lb bought M size fits perfect


Ordered XXL usually size larger than I normally wear, still a little snug, but stretchy material make it okay. Beautiful color great for holiday wear.


Very nice dress and beautiful color.  Just a suggestion... wear only in temps below 40 degrees as it will keep you very warm.


Soft and Flowy!!!
