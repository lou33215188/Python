I like its classic and classy look.


A little small buy will fix with a zipper, in order to make it easy to put on.


Arms wayyyy too snug for size of dress.


This is a beautiful dress.  Runs somewhat small.  I ordered a Medium, I normally wear a small.  But the other reviews mentioned it ran a bit smaller.  I can put it on, I can and will wear it, but it's form fitting that is for sure.  Probably would get a large and be more comfortable.  I'm not going to send it back.  The color is a royal Navy blue, a much darker blue than in the picture.  But still very pretty.  So I'll use it for the wedding after all.


Love the dress, it was perfect


beautiful dress fits great but the color was off. it was way darker than showen. still love it though


I really like it. It fits fine.


snug but it worked. look nice


The price is great but it didn't fit correctly


Beautiful dress, but size runs small.
