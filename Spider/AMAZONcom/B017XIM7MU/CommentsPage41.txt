Very pretty, but way to big.  Urban CoCo runs large to begin with.  The dress is lovely but I need a smaller size.


Love the quality of the fabric, and though it was a bit tight in the arms (I have batwings due to weight loss), I have some time before Christmas to get in shape.


small fit, pretty dress


She said she loves it and will enjoy it. Thanks


This dress is amazing especially for the price. Very high quality. It hides all my flaws. I absolutely love it! Stretchy and comfortable and fits perfectly. Don't pass it up!!


Before dress, wish I would have ordered a size down, but I can get it tailored.


Warm, eleagant, wonâ€™t wrinkle and very comfortable. .

Looks fabulous, I bought it for my girlfriend to wear at a formal dance and she looked absolutely stunning in it!


This dress exceeded my expectations! I am a photographer and always looking for easy on dresses for clients that are gorgeous!
