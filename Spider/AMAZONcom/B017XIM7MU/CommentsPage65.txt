Amazing !


Arms are a little tight. But rest of dress is fine.


Best winter holiday dress ever! I got the dark blue. In the sunshine it has a bit of plastic sparkle, but indoors the depth of the velvety texture sucks all the light from a room in a very good way.


Love itğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


Fit as expected.


I was pretty leery because of the the price and true to be true...but this dress is exceptional!  Fit is amazing!  I do have to get it hemmed but I am short..what is new.  If you love velvet and elegance this is for you!  5'1 105lbs if that helps.


Absolutely gorgeous dresses! I am so happy with my purchase! I got the red and black. I got XL, sizing up from my normal medium and the dresses fit perfectly. The dresses reach the top of my feet. I am 5ft 5 1/2 and 118lbs.,. The velvet is high quality and has a bit of stretch. Love my new holiday dresses!


The dress is absolutely beautiful, it looks exactly like the above image. As far as sizing, I'm 5'1, 119lbs with a large chest ( 34 DD by modern bra sizing ), my measurements are 36, 27, 36, for those in need of reference, and I went with a size Medium and it fit perfectly.  There's about an inch or so of the dress near the bottom that touches the ground but with heels it won't be a problem, and it can also be easily hemmed. All in all I am very pleased with my purchase and I can't wait to wear it!


I am a size 18 and this dress is GORGEOUS! I ordered the red dress, I'll follow up with pictures. Beautiful swinging skirt, the arms fit great and the top is pretty and conservative. I wore it to one Christmas party already and everyone commented on how gorgeous it was! I was not expecting "great" quality for the low price and I was VERY pleasantly surprise! Great dress, highly recommended!


The dress is a little big around the waist for me, maybe because it is heavy? I ordered a medium because a lot of times small is just too small in a lot of cases. I'm 5'7'' and 116 lbs. The solution to the problem for me is a nice belt around the waist. I have a white corset belt that really pulls it all together. The quality of the dress is great, I love the color as well. In the winter it will keep me warm and stylish!
