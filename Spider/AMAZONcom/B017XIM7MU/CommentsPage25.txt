This is a lovely dress and looks wonderful on the recipient.


Beautiful rich green velvet. Disappointed that dress wasn't true to size. Too small.


Ordered for my daughter. She LOVES it!!  Looks great on!


I saw reviews saying the dress fit small, this is not the case as the material is stretchy and the dress is beautiful.  It is the first dress my granddaughters take out of me closet to use for dress-up.


I love the stretchiness of the material. Dress is elegant, yet very comfortable. It fits as expected.


Beautiful material and fot well. Too short for me so I returned the dress. A little frumpy, subdued event dress.  Could likely have accessorized but since I returned it, I canâ€™t reallt say how that would actually be.


Awesome product. I bout for a costume for theme party at a national level pageant. It looks wonderful. That's for fast shipping


Can't wear it and got sick so I couldn't return it..


Beautiful, soft, well-made dress! I'm 5'2" @ 117lbs and the small is a bit too big.  The dress hangs down to my ankles, and the sleeves go to my wrists but for the price this dress is awesome, and I'm sure an X'S would fit perfectly. (:


This dress is beautiful! It's heavy and sooo warm. Perfect for winter months. Very flattering.
