Runs 1 size small


Beautiful and comfortable. Exactly what I wanted.


Beautiful dress


Fits as expected and good quality item.


Beautiful dress!


Hideous. Ugliest thing I've had on my body since my last boyfriend. Cheap material, color was off, fit is atrocious, sleeves too short, skirt an awkward length, terrible waist line and neck line. AVOID.


This dress was absolutely perfect!


Very good quality just ran a little small through the chest.


Love the dress. Fits like a dream


This dress is exceptional . Loved this in mulberry color and the Velvet is gorgeous . It's ankle length as shown .
