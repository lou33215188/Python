Is exactly  like the picture !  I  love  it


Good


material is way too heavy and stretchy and has an odd nap  the skirt part of the dress has a lot of fabric


Ordered larger size. Looked good on and was very comfortable.


First size too small. Returned and next size perfect


Nice dress


I like the fabric.  The dress is well made.  It looks really beautiful on.


I love this dress! Fit quite a bit too large but it was very easy to take in the sides myself.


Beautiful! So sad it was too large in places.


Nice color, somewhat small, hoping it will not shrink when washed. Much darker than pictured also.
