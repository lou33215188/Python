Need to hem 2 inches or so for my height, 5'3".Nice color, fabric and fit.


The color is beautiful but it is just a little too small. I love the fall of the skirt and the fabric.


Fit perfectly and had many compliments from others!


This  dress is gorgeous! Beautiful fabric with a skirt that moves. Unbelievable quality for the price. I will buy more from this company!


The dress was a good fit, sizes range small so I ordered 2 sizes up & it was perfect


Very pretty.  I got lots of compliments when I wore it and the fit is flattering.


Very lovely dress! I’m 5’1, 120 pounds, size small was a little big and I would not be able to wear without very high heels.


Love it. Looks great even on people without the perfect model figure.


beautiful dress but was HEAVY


Very comfortable.  This dress is long on me but I am 5’2”.  Besides that, it fits great, is comfortable and has a classy look.  Love it!
