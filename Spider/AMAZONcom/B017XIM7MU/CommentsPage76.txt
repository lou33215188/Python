Love it!  The design is flattering!  I'm on the heavy side at 5' 2" but the way this dress falls hides my imperfections.  It's a bit long, I plan to wear shoes 3 inches high and it would be perfectly fine, no hemming needed.  It's made nicely and fits comfortably, perfect for fall and winter weather.


The velvet is beautiful. It does not show wrinkles, or where you have been sitting. It hangs nicely and is just right for ballroom dancing. The material is slightly elastic and this makes it fit well. I am purchasing it in another color. This dress looks expensive. I have no qualms wearing it to our ballroom dance club dances.


Runs short. Heavy fabric with nice movement, but the stitching and fit aren't the greatest. Wouldn't expect anything more out of the price.


The dress looked prettier in the picture  But it still was pretty.  It fit a bit too big for a small that I ordered


Love dress so much ordered a second one


Looked nice when I sang at church musical


It is a very heavy material so if it is too large, it will really hang. I returned it because it was just too large and baggy. It would be a great costume dress, though.


Very nice dress, smaller in chest


Dress fit well and looked great.  Was comfortable wearing it to a function on a very cold evening.  The review would have been five stars except the dress arrived later than originally stated and made it just in the nick of time.


5'8".  Size 10.  Bought a large.  It's a little loose in the waist, but a smaller size would have meant smaller arms and chest.  The dress hit me right ab out the ankles, so I didn't have to hem it.  I received many compliments on the dress.  I haven't washed it yet though, so I'm not sure if it will shrink.
