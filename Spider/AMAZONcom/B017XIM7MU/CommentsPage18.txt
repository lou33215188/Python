Love this! Looks beautiful! Very flattering on my hourglass figure. Does attract cat and dog hair like crazy, but totally worth slipping a small lint roller in your bag.


This is a stunning dress. I am 5'4" weigh 125, 34D bust. I ordered a small and it fits beautifully. Actually, I can comfortably eat a full course meal and not worry ğŸ˜‚


I bought this for my Mother's Funeral Service and she loved so beautiful! Thank you for this dress.  I couldn't have found a more gorgeous purple velvet dress.


This is a high quality dress. I wasn't expecting it to be as nice because it's so cheap. It's super soft, elegant and exceeded my expectations. It's also super comfortable. It has stretch to it to fit all body types. I'm 5'9" and a size 16. I ordered XXL and it fits perfect.


Beautiful dress! Impulse buy for a concert I sang in and it is a very flattering dress.  Color shows up great on stage and material is nice and comfortable.


Lovely dress.  Purchased a medium for my 5'5" daughter, normally a size 8.  Fabric has a little give to it, so it fit her very well.  Length came almost to her ankles. Soft fabric feels nicer than you'd expect for the price.  Good value.


Very off size, likeLarge to X- Large for the Small size request. It doesnâ€™t match the pictures for the fabric quality. Even the color looked cheap. I ordered one months ago was green and it was perfect.


LOVED this dress. The velvet material is so thick and you can twirl in it. The royal blue color was gorgeous. The fit was extremely flattering. After showing it to others, they wanted to buy it too. I now have the problem of wanting the other colors. Highly recommend this beautiful dress as itâ€™s my favorite clothing Iâ€™ve ordered online and the price was extremely reasonable.


Very pretty.  Nice, soft velvet.  Great price.  I had to return the medium for the small as it ran big.  Don't go by the size chart.  I am 5'1", 125 pounds.


Lovely dress.  I simply love it.  I am 5'2" big busted.  I ordered a XL.  It is of course too long for me so  had to have the length adjusted and added a slight train.


  It turned out beautifully.  For this price, you get a stunning outfit.
