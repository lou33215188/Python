Perfect!


Wearing this to a gala and it is all I wanted! I love it! I am 5'4 and it is a perfect length.


I love this dress. It fits beautifully and has a lovely weight.


This dress is so lovely!!!


But I can Not use it because the upper arm/biceps are way too small !!!


Every other part of this size XL dress fits Great.  Nothing wrong with the chest, tummy, bum, shoulders or lower arm of sleeves but that crazy Small upper arm/biceps makes it Unusable.


It was $13 to mail back... Very sad me as it was so nice looking.


I'm 5.2" - 175lbs.  Ordered an XL.  Just brushes the floor - so I won't have to hem it!  Hoorah!  HOWEVER - the cut or sewing around the bodice into the sleeves is weird.  I can't put my arms completely down!  I'm keeping the dress because I'm using for a concert - where I won't need to put my arms down, and I don't need to hem it!  Two major pluses.  But . . .strange.


Lovely velvet fabric - it is a bit heavy.  But not impossible!  It will be interesting to see how hot it gets!


This was a good choice


Perfect!


I ordered this dress to wear to a holiday party. It arrived severely wrinkled in a plastic bag. When I tried it on the wrinkles remained.  It smelt and looked like a cheap Halloween costume. It's also sized very generously. I'm size 8/10, I ordered a medium and I was swimming in it! The velvet is also of poor quality and the color varies throughout the fabric. I promptly returned the dress! This dress would work well for a witch or gypsy costume.  You get what you pay for.


Fits wonderfully.
