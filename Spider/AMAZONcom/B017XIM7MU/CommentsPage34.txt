Love it but wish it was just one size larger. The top of the dress runs small.


I'm 5'9" and about 200 pounds. I bought a large and it fits great. The color is beautiful and the length is perfect.


elegant


This dress was perfect for my Waltz Showcase performance. Beautiful in stage lights, and flowed so prettily on turns..everyone was complimenting it after the performance :D


very beautiful....love it!


Love this dress!  Best part no zippers to break or buttons to loose.


This is a nice dress.  I bought it for my niece's wedding. The wedding is in Utah so this warm, soft and stylish dress will be perfect.  And the price was right!


Love this, fits as expected, nice not have the neckline too low, perfect neckline


Totally love this dress.  Normally wear a large or x-large and had to get a xx-large for it to work.  That worked and looks great!


Had to return it because it was just too tight in the arms.  Ordered the next size up.
