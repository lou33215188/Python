For the first time an online dress shopping has matched and exceeded my expectations. Generally the material or the quality of construction is pretty bad if we are buying from unknown brands.... but this was a lovely fit and quality! Thank you guys.


Love, love my beautiful Christmas Dress... although was advised I look like Princess Fiona by my kids... ! But at least they both said BEFORE she turned into an ogre...! ğŸ˜‰ l will definitely buy another...


too small in the bust for me....didn't like the fabric either


Not as form fitting in the torso, but was great for my purpose of purchasing. It was lovely for my college dance with my husband. I got lots of really great compliments.
