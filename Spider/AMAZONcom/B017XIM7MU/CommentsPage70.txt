It was a bit smelly when it came, but it fits nicely and the color is as expected.

This dress is absolutely gorgeous. I was a little apprehensive about the fit, since I've had some major disappointments with clothing from east asia that I've ordered online, even when following their size charts and/or sizing up a bit, but the XXL fit me like a glove. I'm normally a 14/16 in womens, with a generous bust, shoulders and bum with a little bit of a tummy and this dress is super flattering.


The fabric is great with just enough stretch to be forgiving, but also very dense and luxurious. My one complaint is that, because I'm relatively short at about 5'3" or so, this dress is a bit long on me. Wearing flats, the bottom does hit the floor just a bit, so I'll need to get it altered just a little to prevent it getting tattered and dirty since I don't usually wear heels.


I ordered this a little over a month ago for a thanksgiving day party. I just took it out to steam for tomorrow and it has a large hole right in the front! ğŸ˜¢ It seems to be a factory hole as there was nothing wrong with the packaging. It is also a little larger in the waste than I expected- but that could easily be taken in. Im very disappointed as it is a beautiful dress.


This dress was nothing like I expected even after reading the reviews.  It was not at all flattering.  I expected a thin, flowing, velvet material and it is much more like a bath robe.  I sent it back


Don't fit me well
