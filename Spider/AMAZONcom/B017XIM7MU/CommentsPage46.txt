Get a size down I got a medium (normal size) and it was huge on me. Very comfortable and flattering.


love the dress no flare though , will have to get a under garment to flare it , also im 5'4 so a little long , will have it hemmed. the color is gorgeous.


Perfect for the purpose I bought it for. Nice long floor length. But it is sized big. I usually wear a medium in everything. I should have bought the small in this!


beautiful - very elegant


Bought this for a Game of Throne cosplay party and it turned out great! I’m 5’3”, 120lbs, 36D, and the small fit perfectly.


It's terrific! Too too too beautiful and elegant! A must buy


Gorgeous, true to color, and comfortable


Color is pretty


dress is ver long


Not low cut


Not sure if I am keepin


Once you put the dress on nest not show the elegance of the picture


not too small but way too short. I am 6 ft tall.


The color, sheen, texture of the material were spot on. It is acutally more modest than I thought it would be.  Overall a very nice dress for the price.
