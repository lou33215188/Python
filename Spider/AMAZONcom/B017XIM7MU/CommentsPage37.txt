This dress is good weighted material, makes one feel very regal.


This  dress is beautiful. Daughter wore it to a mascarade ball. It fit in her suitcase. She pulled it out. No wrinkles. Ordered Monday was here wed.


Amazing dress,  got lots of compliments ,


I love this dress! It fits perfectly and the color was exactly what I expected. The reviews were very helpful and the description was completely accurate. I’m 5’7 and I normally wear a dress size 12 so the large was perfect for me!


very nice


it's great


Nice Dress but it does run small. On the fence about keeping it.


From the waist down it drapes nicely but the bust and arms are small in comparison to the bottom.


This is a really ugly and tacky dress. I purchased it for my grandmother who was planning on wearing it for Christmas. We both hated it. It was just huge and the color and material is very tacky


BEAUTIFUL***** I purchased the Wine Red "Stunning" in an XL for my 5' 9 1/2" H - 36D/31/37 frame and the fit was perfect, the length on me goes down to just above my ankles (like on the model).  GO BY THEIR SIZE CHART - NOT AMAZON and you will be fine in selecting the right fit.  The velvet is soft, deep color and rich looking.  I plan on wearing for a Valentines Ball and this will be stunning, with 2 1/2 inch ballroom shoes the length will be perfect.  This is a lot of dress and it felt heavy coming out of the package but once I slipped it on the dress flowed beautifully and has a great skirt that fans out as you spin around.  If you are under 5'9" I would be prepared to have it hemmed.


Very pretty dress. Good quality and price. My teenager is going to wear it as part of a Halloween costume......Merida, Brave Disney princess. :)
