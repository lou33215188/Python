This dress is super cute! I ordered a size up just to be safe and it was too big so I ordered a size down. Other than being too large the dress is awesome ! Very soft and stretchy fabric. I am 5 foot 9 and the dress came down to just above my ankles. The dress is also very breathable.


I returned the dress because it was to big. On me the dress looked like a a fuzzy bathrobe. Did not fit like pictures.


I normally wear a size 6 and and am 5'4"ordered a small so it is floor length on me.  We live in a very active senior community that hosts a lot of snowbirds and this year we are doing a "senior" prom, this dress will be perfect.  The quality is very good and color is a true sapphire blue.  Can't go wrong for the $.


I just received my dress and it is beautiful. The fabric is a good weight, the color is black and lush. I'm very excited about wearing this dress.


Terrible, Halloween-costume level quality.


My wife looked absolutely stunning in this dress!


going to a wedding in the fall will be perfect....


Perfect stylish nice dress I loved . Fabric is very nice color style is great.


Love this dress and everyone who sees it, loves it too!


Like so much about this dress, which is a very dark green velour - almost looks black.  Just wish the sleeves had a bit more room.  They're quite tight and I bought the dress to use performing on a musical instrument that requires holding my arms up.  Not quite sure if it will be comfortable enough to use for a concert coming up this weekend.
