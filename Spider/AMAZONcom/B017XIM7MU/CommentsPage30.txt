Too small


Great inexpensive dress. Bought for my daughter to wear during concert season.


Great dress!  Perfect fit.


I got a ton of compliments on this dress, which I wore when about 6 months pregnant. It was perfect for a holiday party, and super comfortable too.


Dress fits well and is comfortable but it has stained absolutely everything it came in contact with, my couch and pillows and Afghan, my bedspread and even my skin!  I washed it and the stained items and the stain did not come out.  Never had a dress stain like this.


Comfortable fit with regal look. Great for a winter event. I would need to hem but I'm only 5ft 1in. The sleeves are a little too tight for me but that's due to my body shape.


This dress fits perfectly and the material has a wonderful weight.  It hangs fabulously.


Nice fit and hides bulges!  Thank you


Fits perfectly.  Gorgeous sheen.  A perfect "twirling" dress for the holidays.


It fits perfect! I based my size on your sizing chart. The velvet is good quality and the price unbelievable. I am sorry I did not purchase another one in black.
