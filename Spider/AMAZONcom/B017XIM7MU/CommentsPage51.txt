Absolutely wonderful dress - amazing quality!!!! Might buy in every color! :)


It was too short. Very nice cut.


I like color, I like color blue.Fit perfect and very soft and comfortable


The photo looks better than the real thing. The dress was well made of a nice thick velvet that sort of looked like a mix between crushed velvet and normal velvet. The dress was a bright Christmas red unlike the scarlet/burgundy color in the photo. I am pretty busty, but I felt there should have been more room and stretch in the bust of this dress. Also the waistband was not very flattering on me. It just looked like a big block in the middle of my stomach. The length was good on me (4'11") just brushing the ground, but it might be considered too short for taller women.


The dye is not good. I was holding my son and his white shirt became pink from my dress. Other than that it is a superb dress


The dress is BEAUTIFUL! The fabric is a thick velvet! It looks like a very expensive, elegant gown!


too long, had to cut off 5 inches.


The best dress i wear that fit me so elegant...So much compliment in a day.I am happy i purchase this dress.


overall good fit, neckline comes up very high. sleeves fit arms (no rolling). nice weight for winter clothing. very warm


I love this dress, slightly stretchy material and soft feel. Very comfy dress
