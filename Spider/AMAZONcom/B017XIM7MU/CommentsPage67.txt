Ordered this according to the product description sizing and it was still way too big so I will return.


Overall dress fit as expected with the exception of the long sleeves. They fit tight, so consider ordering a size larger than you expect if you want to keep the sleeves as is. If not, alterations may be needed.


I bought this dress for my daughter, who is 5' tall and about 100 pounds. The dress was a bit long and fit loose in the waist.  I took it in and shortened it and it was perfect. If the dress had come in extra small, or petite size, it probably would have been a better fit.  Otherwise we're very happy with the quality and price of the dress.


This was my present to my daughter, who has the same dress in a different color. She loves this new one.


This dress fits exactly as I expected it to.  I read lots of reviews on this dress and others I were considering, which was a great help.  I am 5'4" tall and around 178 lbs.  The dress is very comfortable and the length is perfect.


Such a pretty and comfortable dress. I bought both smalls and mediums in black and wine colors. I am 5'4" and 105 pounds. I lift weights and thought by the reviews I read that the arms would be way too tight if I bought a small. However, I found the small was perfect and the mediums were too large. For me being a true small, I felt the dresses were true to size.


Loved it; will buy more in different colors; Fits very nicely!!


A little bit small but fits close enough for my liking.


My lady looks simply marvelous when she puts it on
