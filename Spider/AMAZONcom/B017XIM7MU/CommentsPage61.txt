super adorable.


We ordered a little small for this one, but mom wants to keep it


I'm keeping the dress. It's very pretty and will give me incentive to get into it.


I love itğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


the dress part was fine but the sleeves were way too tight


Not bad..im 5 8" 128lbs so I expected it to be a little short and a little baggy but not as bad as I thought it be. Doesnt look cheap either.  Shipping was FAST.


Great value


JUST RIGHT!!!


Great winter dress!


Fits
