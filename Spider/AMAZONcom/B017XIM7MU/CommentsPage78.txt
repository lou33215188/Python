The sleeves were tight. It did not feel like the size I ordered. Other wise the dress was beautiful. Needs to explain sizing in 2x would be a 18-20 and I cannot recall if,it's a women's size.


Mine came in the mail yesterday. I was a bit nervous about the Medium size I ordered. It fit like it was made for me. I love it and so glad i purchased this on impulse. I will be buying more in other colors.


Arrived in a timely way, packed well, nice weight to the fabric. For me however, the dress was ill-fitting and would cost me much more to try and get it altered than I paid for the dress. I am returning the garment for a refund and purchase a different outfit.


Quite impressive.


This dress is beautiful. Wore it to a December wedding and it was comfortable, festive and elegant! Fits small. I'm 5'2" and size 6. Needed a large in this.


I am 5â€™3 and 150 pounds I ordered the small one. It fit perfectly!!


Very elegant. No one believed that I bought it for this cheap.


It came in and fit beautifully!!!


I love it ! Great quality. Would love to see more from this company.


this dress is only fitting to be worn as a Halloween costume
