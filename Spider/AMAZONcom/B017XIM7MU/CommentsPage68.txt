I purchased this dress for my niece who passed away on Christmas eve. She looked so beautiful in her favorite color and I found purple Isotoner slippers to match. She was 36 years old with 3 children.


I love this dress,  the color was as expected. I normally wear Large but based on other review recommendations, I ordered an XL and that fits perfectly. The length is also perfect.I am going to get it in another color and I would recommend this dress!!!

Thank you


Gave it away/


This dress is lovely and very affordable. The fabric is lovely, and it is very comfortable. I am very happy with it.


Have no idea how it fits and I hate that I cannot review a clothing product without answering this. Instead of velvet, I received a horribly ugly lace dress with a bow at the bodice.  Nothing I would ever wear and not what I ordered. The material was so awful and cheap I opted for a refund as I would not want anything that company produces.
