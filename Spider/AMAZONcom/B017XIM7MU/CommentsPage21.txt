I totally loved it!!! Itâ€™s cute and classy at the same time! The color is amazing and the texture is really good.


I didn't like it because it was too big, it made me feel like I was wearing a bag, and because I'm not a fan of velvet. I bought it because I was looking for a long sleeve, long dress and I was hoping I would I be surprised and actually like it. It didn't work for me.


Beautiful blue gown.


I am very happy with how it is made and the fabric is rich in texture and color.


I was asked many times if I could be touched because they wanted to feel if the dress was as soft as it looked.


Beautiful dress but not true to suze chart. I ordered large but I should of ordered medium


This is a great bargain.  As others have mentioned, the sleeves run tight.  I wear and 8 and this worked fine for me.  It is quite warm-so if you plan to dance much-yours going to need to take breaks to cool off.


Love this dress. I ordered a medium and though it could be an inch smaller in the waist I never know when pms with hit. LOL the construction is lovely and definitely better than I expected for the price.


This dress was so elegant I wore it for Christmas Eve and I wear to church especially when itâ€™s cold outside itâ€™s very feminine and I felt like a queen wearing this dress it is beautiful and I wear a full slip which makes it even prettier


I read all the reviews before purchasing this dress.  I was very pleased with it.  It is so pretty and soft.


I really like this dress..  The style and the fabric are lovely.  It was just a bit too tight across the chest for me.


This dress is beautiful and fits nicely; skimming my bodice and flaring out slightly. The fabric gives too!
