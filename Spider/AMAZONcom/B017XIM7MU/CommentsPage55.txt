This dress is beautiful. I ordered a size larger and I'm glad I did! It's fits great! I can't believe what a fabulous deal this was! Great quality.


I love this dress and it fit perfect. A really great dress for the price!!!!!!


Loved this ! Runs a little short but perfect to show off a cute heel


I love this dress, fits well and is easy to wear.  I am 5'6" tall, though, and the dress is almost to the floor on me.  If you are more petite, in terms of height, you may have to have the dress shortened.


It's a beautiful dress. The fabric is heavier and of a higher quality than I expected. I wear a size 16-18. The XXL fits well. Wonderful deep green color.


Got it so quickly and was wildly flattering. I felt like the bell of the ball for $30
