I read the reviews about the dress and they were good. The velvet fabric is very nice however its too long & I have to wear high heels or have it hemmed.


It is amazing product with good quality and nice design. The fabric is very soft and stretchable and comfortable touch. Shipping is very fast. I bought one green color and going to buy Wine color.


Love the color and fit! For petite girl love the long length.


Fast shipping. The dress was beautiful for our Christmas gathering.


Incredibly beautiful dress!!! Very well constructed and flattering.


Not velvet, more like cheap shiny velor.  Looks and fits like a bathrobe.... extremely unattractive.


Nice dress, pretty color!  Very comfortable.  Perfect for the winter wedding that I wore it to.


So pretty I wore it for D&D and everyone loved the whole costume, plus it was super comfy!


Fine dress. Quite big for a medium. Did return but nothing terrible about it but the size.


The dress was small in the arms. The color is great. The length is perfect.
