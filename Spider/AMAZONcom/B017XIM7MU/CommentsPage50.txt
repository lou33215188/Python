Love it!  Wearing this to a wedding in January


This dress was more than what I expected. I purchased this dress for a special occasion, and I couldn't been any happier with the look and value. I would recommend this dress to anyone looking for an elegant yet inexpensive dress.


Cheap quality. Not as expected


Nice quality, fit and drape.  Friends impressed when they found out how little it cost.  Beautiful with glittery black shawl, heels and pearls


Very pleased with this dress. Fit as expected. I am 5’ 5” at 160 lbs My dress size is 12 . I ordered a size large. Perfect!


The dress fit as expected. It's beautiful, I got so many compliments.(And such a great deal!!)I would definitely recommend this dress.


Fit perfectly.


Length is too long for someone under 63 inches, arms are slightly tight, and neckline is higher then looks in pictures. Otherwise for someone taller then I am and slightly thinner would look great.


Love the color of this dress. Only tried it, never worn yet. Very stylish.


Great dress!  Very comfortable.  Lots of Compliments!
