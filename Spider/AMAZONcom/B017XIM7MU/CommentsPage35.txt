Gorgeous dress. So comfortable.  Fabulous for the Holidays.!!


From previous reviews I had a pretty clear understanding how the dress would fit. I'm 5'4" so it is long, but with heels perfect. Bodice and arms are snug but that's on me...ordered X-lg. I need to shed the 8 lbs, gained..... then all is well. Beautiful with my southwest turquoise. :)


could have gotten away with a small but it's a very nice dress...heavy frabric and good costruction


It looks a bit different than in the picture on this site. Arrived very quickly.


I wore this for Christmas. .it was beautiful and received many compliments!


Such good quality!! It’s so comfortable and flowing! I’m just going to add a gold belt and it will be perfect for my daughters quinceañera!


Very flattering fit and drapes beautifully


Thank you !


Fit just right, very pretty.


I am pregnant and bought this dress for a outdoor November wedding that turned out to be chilly -- and not only did I feel great in it, I also got a ton of conpliments!


Order 1-2 sizes up!
