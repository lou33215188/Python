Loved it.


A Beautiful Dress.


The length is fine, I'm 5'4", but the chest is way too tight.


Then dress was beautiful and arrived quickly and unwrinkled. However the upper arm area was so tight that it was uncomfortable. Wish these clothes came in American sizes. I will be returning it unfortunately.


Stunning color in person matches photo perfectly.  Material is stretchy, soft and flows beautiful.  Made very well and was comfortable, while looking stunning.  I wore this for over 12 hours and never had an issue with it.  Mine was 2XL and made my waist look slimmer and accents the bustline.  Slight static in skirt portion was solved with small amount of lotion applied to skirt inside.


Its good. stitching perfect


Very elegant
