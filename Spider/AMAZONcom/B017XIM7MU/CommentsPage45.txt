ACCORDING TO THE REVIEWS AND SIZE CHART IT SHOULD HAVE FIT ME.  I DID READ ONE THAT SAID THE ARMS WERE TO SMALL, SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THAT ONE.  THE  TOP FROM THE WASTE UP ARE VERY SMALL INCLUDING THE ARMS.  THE MATERIAL IS STRETCHY, BUT THE WAY THE WAIST LINE IS DONE, IT CAN'T STRETCH THERE, WHICH IS WHERE IT NEEDS IT THE MOST.  UNLESS YOU ARE A TINY PERSON, THESE AREN'T GOING TO WORK FOR YOU.  I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GET THE MEASUREMENTS TO PUT IN THEIR SIZE CHART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO BY THE INCHES THEY PUT IN THERE AND YOUR MEASUREMENTS AND IT SHOULD FIT, BUT IT DOESN'T.  I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE IT AWAY TO MY FRIENDS 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.  DON'T EVEN WANT TO DEAL WITH EXCHANGES.  LUCKILY IS WAS NOT THAT MUCH MONEY TO BE OUT, THAT'S WHY I TOOK A CHANCE.  OH WELL.


Loved it! Looks great! Bought it for my daughter, she felt pretty and comfortable, loved the drape if the fabric and the flare of the skirt. We plan to get more in different colors.


I am 5'7 and I weigh 120lbs, I bought the size small blue dress and let me tell you that I felt like a princess. It's such a beautiful dress! Totally recommend it :))


Sizing was off, but, material was lovely.


The only complaint I have is that the line that come at the waist are too high on me since I have a longer torso. Quality is great, keeps you warm, and looks gorgeous.


Can't wait to wear it to the ball!


It's a keeper, even if I have to wear a foundation garment.


I ordered a large for my mother because it figured the xl would have been too big and long. The dress was beautiful the only issue she had was that the sleeves were too tight.


I'm giving this dress 5 stars even though I had to return it.Its a beautiful dress and a great price. It just didnt fit me quite right. The material that should have been under my breasts was halfway over them. It just didnt flatter me and I'm disappointed.


I bought this dress for a friend a size bigger than her original size. It ended up being a little tight on the arms and waist. But it looked very nice.
