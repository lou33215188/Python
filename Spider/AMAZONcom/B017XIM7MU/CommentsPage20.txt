I'm 5'4" a 38 DD and about 150. I bought a medium and it fit beautifully! Very nice for winter and very flowy! Probably going to buy more of their colors :-)


Size medium fit me very nicely (150 lbs, 5'8"). It was so comfortable and I received many compliments. The mulberry color is beautiful.


This dress is very comfy. It’s warm and soft. It also works great for breastfeeding. At 5’9” and 190 lbs., the size large works well. Will probably still fit well after I lose some baby weight too.


Gorgeous and beautiful and fits true to size.  Go with the smaller than the larger size if shes in the middle of the two sizes.


Beautiful dress!  It is a snug fit (especially in the arms).  V-neck is high enough that a camisole is not necessary!  Very flowing and elegant.


Pretty and comfortable! Fits well enough. I'm 5'5" and 115lbs, the length is perfect but the waist is a little lose. Still looks great though! Very warm. Will work well for the Renaissance Faire with a cloak!


The size I usually wear is 6 and this fit - plenty of room in the dress but the bustline was too small by a couple inches.  Needed the next size up.


It fit kind of wonky and it was too big. I sent it back. Definitely didn’t seem like a formal dress fit for a formal event.


Like the dress, but there was a tear in the waist.  Also, am 5'8, so waist is sadly a little high.  But nice dress over all.


I returned this dress. I was looking for an elegant velvet dress for a winter wedding. This is not that dress. I am 28 and this dress said “Merlin the wizard” when I put it on which was not the look I was going for, obviously.
