Beautiful


My daughter wore this for a winter formal,  we ordered a size up and ended up taking it in. It was beautiful,  received lots of compliments.  Very classy dress!


This dress was exactly what we were looking for. We modified it a bit to use as a costume for Merida (the main character from Brave).


Perfect! Heavy material, sleeves aren't too loose, I'm in love!


Nice stretchy. Iâ€™m 5 feet and busty.  XL fits snug and with slight heel no need to hem. I think 1x would be too big. Very happy.


Beautiful dress.  I can't wait to wear it at Christmas time.


This is a beautiful dress. I have one in black as well.


Love it!!


Love the dress.  Easy to wear and elegant.


Fit was great just too heavy for a Florida Christmas. I debated returning it and holding onto it until next year. This is a great dress for a cold Christmas.
