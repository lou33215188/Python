Love this long dress. The large fits  snug over rib cage but will be fine. I am a 10-12.


ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! WORE IT TO XMAS PARTY,  A HIT WITH EVERYONE!


Does not fit like a true size small, was baggy.


Wow!  This is a great dress for so little.  Fits well and nothing hangs out.  I usually wear an 8 or 10 and ordered a medium.


Sleeves were small


Love this dress. Beautiful, opulent color. Stretchy velvet, so the fabric is not too heavy or stiff. Very long...which I want. Dressy casual or very dressy, depending on shoes and accessories.


the dress looked very nice on the web site, but not at all once I received it


So soft and comfy. This looks so great and fits great.


Gorgeous dress, fits perfectly. Skirt is swingy and hangs well. Well made considering the price. I'm going to order more of these in different colors!


Absolutely beautiful! I bought four different colors in the same style. They look elegant. Can hardly wait to wear them over Christmas. Fantastic price!
