The dress was beautiful but the sleeves were way too tight for me. I returned the dress as there was not enough time to get a bigger size..


This dress is beautiful. The fabric is lush. The fit is perfect. I had it hemmed to mid-calf length. I love it.


This dress is fabulous! Bought it for Christmas and no one could believe how cheap it was.


Soft, elegant and just perfect.  I thought it was a bit small so be careful with sizing


Very nice dress


Fantastic dress at a great price.


stretchy, long and beautiful.  Love this dress


Beautiful dress - well made, attractive on. Sent it back because I decided on a blue dress.


BEAUTIFUL dress but the wrap v-neck doesn't seem to want to sit quite right in the shoulder area.


Bought for Fiona dresses for our production of SHREK.  Just beautiful dresses.  Very happy
