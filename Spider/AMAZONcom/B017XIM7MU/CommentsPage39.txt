I just tried the dress on today. I have mulberry.  Runs Slightly small but that's ok with me as it looks form fitting now. I love it so. Much I just ordered green as well.


Arrived on time , was a gift, fit her perfect, she loves it, thanks.


Love it, fit perfectly!


Very heavy - would be warm in winter weather but I wanted it for an indoor occasion and it will be too heavy for that.


This dress is very warm. It makes the wearer look very conservative. The Material is velvity and is very heavy.


Love this dress, perfect for Christmas and other seasonal outings. Very flattering and comfy.
