Love this! I bought this for A new years wedding in Canada. Plus I bought a faux fur scarf to wear with it! Lots of compliments!


Love the fabric and style.


Good quality velvet, very soft, like how simple and elegant it is. I got a small and it was a bit too big for me in the bust and arms (however most dresses are a bit big on me), just wish they would add an xs size.


This is a very nice dress, at a good price.  My granddaughter wanted it for her prom dress and she loves it.  The fabric is nice, it fits well and she looks and feels beautiful with it on.


After reading all the reviews on this product I felt confident to buy it and I was NOT disappointed. The fabric, color and fit (I'm 5"8 and 174 lbs) is just as described and I wore this dress for a Winter Ball and it looked very elegant. Highly recommend.


I love this dress!!  It is beautiful!  The color, material, and design are all perfect.  Unfortunately, it is one size too large for me, so I must send it baxk.


It was very well made and looked great for a holiday dress


runs small with a gal that has boobs.


She loved it. First simple yet formal winter-ready dress sheâ€™s had. Comfortable and elegant.


Beautiful dress.  Will buy again in a different color.
