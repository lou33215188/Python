Fits perfectly, very comfortable, & well made. Thank you!


Great concert dress. Great price! So comfortable since it's stretchy.


Two long.  A little outdated.  Going to hem it and add something to it to update it.  Colitis beautiful.


My only complaint is that the top is too conservative.


I like it very much! it feels really comfortable because the fabric is very soft. It fits me very well! I look thin with that dress! I would highly recommend this dress to my friends.


I love the look and the compliments. It's soft,  the weight feels rich and drapes very well.  A tiny bit smaller than I wanted but very happy with my purchase. Great for the holidays or a special event.


Loved it and I carry most of my weight in my stomach area, this was definitely flattering. It was warm wouldn't recommend for summer or warmer days for sure.


Beautiful, flowing.  Felt good to wear.  I am tall and it was cocktail length which looked great.


The arms are a bit tight and the bodice is higher then the image shown.


Wonderful dress but runs very small. I had to send it back.
