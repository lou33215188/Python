Really nice outfit! Wearing to an evening party.


too long


It fits snug around my arms but that normal for me. I received a lot of compliments on the dress.


This dress is awesome! It's great material, fit wonderfully and i received many compliments on it. I suggest getting this one


Dress is very pretty but made very small. I ordered a size above my own and it still did not fit!


Perfect Fit!


LOVE the dress; look and feel of it. Fits just like expected although too long. Other than that it's perfect.


Love the dress. Would like to exchange for size small


This dress is beautiful! Don't hesitate to purchase. It's heavy and fits perfectly.


Nice quality for the price. It is longer than I expected, and I hope it is very cold when I where it. It is warm.
