This dress is so elegant, I thought it might look cheap but its made very well. I also was hoping it would be the right royal blue and not too light and its perfect, Its a nice dark blue. Im in love with this dress. Im 5'1 and it comes to my ankles with no heels so its perfect. Im also 155lbs and dont normally get dressses that are fitted around the waist but this dress is so flattering. Lol some of these pics arent that great but they are funny.


I love the dress but didn't receive the color I ordered. I ordered purple but received the mulberry color which is more of burgundy. Will keep but would like to have the dress in purple. Fit is a size smaller I wear xl but ordered xxl fit is perfect. Would like to have the dress in purple too not sure if reordering will get the color I want.


The PERFECT dress for a Mardi Gras Ball!. Very luxurious. I'm sensitive and it was soft inside (some velvety fabrics can be itchy).  Highly recommend it.


I read the reviews on the dress posted from other ladies and it is true order up a size for the best fit.  The dress is gorgeous and flow well.  I received many compliments at a formal event.  Machine washing is definitely a plus. probably will order another one in a different color.


Beautiful dress! Sleeves are too tight and bodice length is too short.  Otherwise a five star dress.  Material is beautiful.


 I agonized for hours searching for something appropriate for a 60 year old overweight short lady!  Iâ€™m 5â€™2â€� 170 lbs 38C and short waisted. This dress is absolutely great! I bought the XL and I couldnâ€™t be happier! And the price is great!


This V neck velvet dress is amazing. I could not believe how great it looked on me. I bought the mulberry in large. It is a beautiful deep ruby-ish color.  I am 5'10 and 145 pounds.38 B.I'm either a 10 or 12. I got the large. The top fit perfectly. I would guess if your bra band width is much larger, you size up. That is wear the first seam is.There is plenty of room for a larger cup size. There is plenty of fabric for larger hips. It's the top you need to be careful fitting, There is some stretch that makes it forgiving and comfortable The listing, photo 2, shows the waistline better that the pictures of the dress. I usually can not wear high waist, but this waist gives a lot of definition.. This is perfect with a wide cinch belt between the two front waist seams. On me the length is as pictured high ankle. If you are much shorter, you may have floor length.I'd buy it and hem it. I was going for a more formal and vintage look. I bought a long black petticoat which is flat at the stomach (you need that) and then holds the dress out a bit and looks fabulous, Otherwise two much fabric to dance, ballroom style. With the petticoat it looks more the the picture of the model turning.. I also used a very decorative belt and shoe clips to dress it up for the vintage themed dance I was going to.. I paired mine with the E-Clover Fashion Floral Rhinestone belt. The big and flashy belt worked and a slim rhinestone belt worked too.  It's a very elegant look.I'm going to get a second color. I can dress it up or down.


I gave this dress 4/5 stars only because I had to order one size larger than normal. Beautiful, rich velvet fabric. Sewn great. One thing- I did fold and pin the fabric in on the chest area to open the dress up more. This was perfect for a November wedding guest. Dress this up or down, it's truly great for any event. I'm so happy with my purchase and will be ordering other colors!


This dress is so comfy yet elegant at the same time!  I wound up purchasing a second one in black!


 Not the greatest picture for I don't have dress shoes on etc..


I am 5.5 and weigh 150/ 34 B bust and bought large


Just got in the same dress but in Black and its so pretty !  Glad that I got both colors in this dress !


I ordered blue one and the color is gorgeous. I received so many complements when I wore this to an event. I am only 5'3'" but with high heels on, the length was perfect. Only wish I have is they will make one more size bigger. I ordered it two days before the event and it got here on the day of the party.  Thank you to Amazon too.
