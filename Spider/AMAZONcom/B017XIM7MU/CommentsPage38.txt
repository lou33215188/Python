Great weight of fabric, lovely fit, grazes my ankles


So beautiful


The dress fits and looks wonderful. I love it!


Absolutely gorgeous dress for the price! Is was slightly large but nothing that couldn’t be solved by a few pins (purchased a small). For reference I’m 5’2” and the dress just slightly hit the floor on me without any heels.


Everything I hoped and more. Beautiful fabric, nice weight, color is vibrant and fit is true to sizing. Very pleased!


Wore this for my maternity pictures. Beautiful dress!


This dress is well made.  The sleeves are pretty narrow, but I don't lift weights so my arms are average size.  I got alot of compliments, and no one believed this was an inexpensive dress.  A simple design and good fabric.  I just might buy a second one.


I'm 5'2" and dress was a bit long for event I was attending.  It was floor length.  I had it hemmed and it worked perfectly!


Beautiful dress flows nicely


Nice fit
