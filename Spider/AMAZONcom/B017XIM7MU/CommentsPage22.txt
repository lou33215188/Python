This is a beautiful dress for the money. Really well made and the material is really luxurious for the price. I bought it for a fall wedding. It fits really nice and looks elegant on.


Cant believe this dress is as great as it is for the price.  Soft and flows well.  Looks expensive on.


This is a gorgeous dress, I'd buy it in every color it fits and feels that nice.  Great item.


Wish the V neck was as shown in the picture. I'm a modest person, but this is cut so high, it's practically to my chin. Not very flattering, just so much extra fabric on the chest. The dress is WARM, perfect for a holiday event. Wish the inside was soft and not as scratchy.


Very pretty and soft.  Stretchy so fits well for lots of sizes.  Nice evening gown length.  Draped neckline is not too low.


Very comfortable, flattering, feels good.  Great for the price.  Bought for a Halloween party but could wear for a dressy occasion.


This is a gorgeous dress for the price.... fits exactly as expected. I wear a size 16 dress and the XL is perfect!


I am giving this a 5 star! I actually ordered this as a 3rd maybe 4th choice because the one I wanted was sold out. I wore this to a Christmas party, and I recieved so many compliments, the dress was so very soft, felt very nice,  and warm. would recommend this dress to any one.


I felt it was heavy. The large fit OK but the fabric is a heavy faux velvet. Very pretty but I didn't like the way I looked in it.


It is more formal. Would be great for wedding parties.


beautiful dress.....order a size larger
