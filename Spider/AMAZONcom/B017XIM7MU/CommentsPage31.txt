Beautiful dress!  I love the color and feel of the dress.  My only complaint is I have to cut and hem it.  Way too long.


This medium fits me just right. The velvet does not look cheap though it is pretty thin. A gorgeous dress.


I got a larger size than normal but the dress is gorgeous! The material is thick and shiny! I wore it New Years Eve and I got complimented! It was much more becoming than an expensive dress I bought at a department store.


Wore it to Christmas party. Very pretty.


Very beautiful and comfortable to wear. Elegant too in the royal blue color.


great for the money


Nicely made. Modest!


This is a fabulous long Valore dress. It fits true to size and looks absolutely exquisite. I cannot believe the cost of the stress. The quality is outstanding. You will not be sorry.


Nice, good quality material. It's a pretty dress but the arms are a little snug. I'm a size 12 and got an L. Everything else was fine.


Loved the dress.  Response was very fast and accepted return very quickly.  The dress just runs small.
