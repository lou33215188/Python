This dress was really beautiful in the Mulberry color. The material is thick, but not too thick and it fit well. I'm usually a size 12-14 in dresses, and an X-large fit perfectly.


However, it just looked too much like Christmas and didn't fit the event that I had bought it for. It's going back.


I really like this dress.  Because I am full busted, I thought it would be too small but the stretch on the fabric is great so it looks nice on me.


Gorgeous, elegant


very nice.


Beautiful Fit. The fabric felt and looked luxurious. I put it on with silver accessories and I looked so regal!!! I'm ecstatic with this purchase.  I will buy again. Thanks


XL  is about a size 8


She loved it but it was to large in the torso.


The perfect dress to wear for Christmas and/or to a New Year's Eve Party. I wore it for Christmas Eve to church and communion. It was comfortable enough to keep on all day. It fit me exactly as the picture shows.


FITS PERFECT AND NICE DRESS. SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST.


THANK YOU
