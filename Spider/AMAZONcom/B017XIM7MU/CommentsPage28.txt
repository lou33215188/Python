Dress is ok. Not even close to a 2x. It's about an average extra large. If you have very small arms, shoulders and chest it will be fine. Seems like decent quality and it would look nice, if it fit.


My sister loved this dress. It's elastic and so has a very forgiving fit.


I bought a large based on reviews and dislike how it fits in my waist area. For the price I think it's a fine dress. I will either wear a belt with it or take it in a few inches so it fits better.  It's hwavy


I loved the rich color, the regal feel and look and the fact that I didnâ€™t have to deal with any cleavage showing. I have gotten countless compliments!


I bought this for a murder mystery dinner but now I'm quite in love with it.  My son kept saying I was a princess....which who doesn't love that!  Very well put together.  Very comfortable and I didn't feel the need to adjust or make sure I wasn't being indecent.  I am definitely going to buy this in a couple other colours.


It's not true too size you need to go up one size larger...other than that nice material ..


very nice quality, had to take in a bit


I bought this dress because I always wanted a velvet dress for the holidays.  I have worn it numerous times from holiday brunches, events, and on Christmas.  Each time I have worn this dress I receive compliments even from strangers.  The dress is very flattering and fits jus right.  I bought a medium my size 5'8, 140 pounds.  I might buy another in different color.


I was surprised of the quality for the price, this was simply a beautiful Christmas dress. I looked like an old Hollywood star on Christmas! I might even purchase it in other colors!


Great find, great buy.  I want more colors!
