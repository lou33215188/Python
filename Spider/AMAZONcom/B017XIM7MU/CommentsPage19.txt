baggy arms.  Will try to hem it but who knows how it'll turn out.  I do have a smaller frame, but it's a stretchy material..  doesn't need to be baggy.


I love velvet and this is no different.  It's soft velvet. I got a large.  I wear a 10/12 in dress.  It is a long dress.  I think the medium will give a more snug fit if one prefers this.  Overall, the dress gets a 5 star.  I got the red.


This dress is BEAUTIFUL! I ordered a size up and it is a little loose in the waist but not so big that it looks frumpy. I got the mulberry and it is a gorgeous deep purpley red. I'm planning on getting this dress in another color because it is so perfect.


I purchased this dress in wine. I never write reviews, but I had to this time. This dress is absolutely gorgeous in person. The quality for this price crazy. I was in shark it's nothing less then perfection. This color is rich, I would get it in black too. This dress is everything ğŸ˜Š  Oh I wear between 12 I purchased an XL. I could have gotten a Large. Either size would fit well. This dress does have stretch.


I would have given this 5 stars if the sleeves didn't fit so tight.  I bought the dress in 3 different colors and they are gorgeous!  Love the way the skirt part flares out and the length is great, as is the material.  Just wish the upper arms weren't so tight.


Although the dress came to the floor (I am 5'3"), I was expecting it to be the length shown in the picture. But it was not. It was very pretty though and fit well...but it will be very warm wearing it as we can expect velvet to be. So,. plan to wear it when it is COLD outside and you will be toasty warm in it.


This dress was beautiful.  It fit as I knew it would and the quality is nice. I think large fit fine but I like to order the next size as my stomach is not completely flat so I don't like dresses to grab me unflatteringly but this worked well.  I like to order the larger size on person but I think it is pretty true to size.


This dress has a very nice style and good quality to it. I'm rather skinny(5'5" and 113 lbs if that helps) so the dress was a tiny bit looser around the arms, an signifigantly looser around the waist. The loose waist can be easily fixed though with a pin, belt, or mattress clip. The material is rather elastic though, so I can see it being forgiving if you're on the upper end of your size.


It fit great and wasn't too long. My only concern was it shed these little fuzzies that got EVERYWHERE including in my nose!! Be careful when taking off the dress. It also left some of the pile wherever I sat/whoever I hugged. Definitely wash it a couple times (separately so you don't ruin your other clothes) before wear.


I'm wearing this as a guest in a wedding. I love the way it feels. I love the color. I love the way it fits. It is attractive and helps slim a larger waste line!
