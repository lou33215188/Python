Really great dress it's cute and fits and is a great value, though it will attract cat hair from a mile away


This is a beautiful dress for the price.  Good quality velvet.  Very nice.


I ordered the XXL in spite of the size chart indicating that I should wear the XL.  It's tight in the chest and shoulders/arms and I am not especially busty.  Otherwise it's fabulous.  The material, cut, drape and swing are amazing.  It's a true make you feel like a princess dress...


This is a fabulous dress for the price.  Lovely color and construction.  Highly recommend.


Color is gorgeous (green). Wore it for church on Christmas Eve to sing and I felt like a million bucks! I’m 5’5” and 210 lbs and generally wear a size 18W. Got the XXL and it fits great! Long enough to wear heels and yet I could wear flats without it dragging the ground. Will probably order it in other colors because I love it so much!


Beautiful dress, fabric looks and feels nice and the dress fits beautifully.


Really great dress for this price - I was surprised! Fits beautifully.


Feels like wearing fuzzy plastic. Odd lines, odd drape -- but pretty color blue.


It's a great dress. I used it as a costume in a play and other than being a bit full of static electricity, it was great. The colors are deep and vibrant.


The price was right and it will be just the thing for the "murder mystery" that I'm in.
