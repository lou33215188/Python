Perfect! I havenâ€™t completely tried it on yet but it appears it will fit with no issues. Love it!


Such quality and beauty! Wore to a funeral.


Nice!


Very cute, but it made me feel like I was going to a funeral so I sent it back.


Love it!


It is somewhat big in the skirt and waist area but fits great in the arms and chest.  I ordered a small so I am surprised it doesn't fit a little better.  Still trying to decide if it is worth taking to a tailor.


The fabric is a little cheap, the sleeves were so small I couldn't button them, best if you have skinny arms.


I tried to return the dress but the seller refused. Amazon eventually handled everything but not impressed with the seller at all.


The left sleeve feels  tight and twisted as if it is on backwards. I do not have time to return it because I need it for this Saturday. The dress itself is cute and fits fine elsewhere.


Really beautiful, good quality and fits perfectly! I'm size 14-16, ordered the XL and it's great. The bottom part looked like it might need some ironing when I got it, but after I hung it, if was OK. Looks elegant and not short, which I love!


Great dressy retro stretch lace top dress with full skirt! True to size! Also purchased Vintage net petticoat to fill out skirt! Love it!
