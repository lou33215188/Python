Good material, lots of room, if you want the slim fit, go a size down. Great for work or week night out


It feels nice and it fits right. I like it


I don't normally leave reviews unless I'm super impressed or extremely disappointed. If you are at all on the fence about buying this dress, BUY IT NOW!!! I'm 5'2", 180lbs, and 38DD, normally an xl but after reading reviews I decided to go with a Large. Everything about this dress is amazing and beautiful. It's so comfortable and fits like a glove. I wish I could buy them all. You won't regret this purchase, I promise!!


Pretty, but fabric is a little hot and itchy.


It's okay, but this still did not look very nice on me. I have wide hips and butt, so the fullness stood out quite a bit.


Very flattering, but the length of the bodice is very short.


I LOVED THIS BEAUTIFUL DRESS!  However, I am 5'2 and it was too long.  I wish I was taller.


It's beautiful dress, but runs little bit small and short. I thought it's gonna be a knee length, but it's 6-7 inches higher. I am 5.6"


I received so many compliments on this dress! No matter what your figure is it will flatter you. Everyone was shocked it came from Amazon.


it was very pretty but ran small. I returned it but have not repurchased
