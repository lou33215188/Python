Great dress - fit was perfect and received many compliments!


I love it...


Absolutely love this dress!! Fits as expected.


I'm 5'4" and 140.  It's a bit short wasted for me and the sleeves are a little tight but I still like the dress.


very cute, vintage looking.  Definitely not for short people. I purchased for a friends wedding but had to make too many changes before it fit right. Very comfortable though.


Fit awesome. Material seems good quality. It does look really nice.


It is just like the picture and fits perfectly! I highly recommend this dress for almost any occasion. I was worried about the quality but it turned out to be high quality (especially the lace!!) Love it ‚ù§


little tight in the top part and the arms also, its good that it stretches i give it a 9


BEST DRESS I EVER GOT!!!


Got lots of compliments about it and it fits PERFECT!!!!!


it's kinda hard to get into but I love the look.
