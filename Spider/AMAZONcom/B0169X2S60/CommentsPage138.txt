Great fit. Heavy fabric. You will need to press it or have it pressed before wear. I had it pressed for $6 and it looks awesome.


The bottom is too long & full. I'm 5' 4"


The dress is nice.  The packaging makes the dress come very wrinkled.  No care was taken.  I think the majority of the other comments revolve around sizing.  You need to use the sizing chart. It's accurate.


Beautiful!  Fits as expected; well constructed.  Totally happy!


LOVE this dress. I wore it with a petticoat. Received so many compliments.


The material is really heavy and the dress it's self is hot. I believe it's perfect for winter but any other occasion not so much.


loved the look of the dress but I wear a size 10 and the medium was way too small. Dress has to be hand washed and it said the color may transfer.


Got it for my mom i loved it on her but shes on the shorter side so she felt like a preschooler so she said


Love this dress. I followed the size chart and read the reviews. The dress fits great.
