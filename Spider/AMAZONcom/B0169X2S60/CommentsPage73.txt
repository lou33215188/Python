I ordered what I thought would be a little bigger dress but I couldn't get it zipped up. It was much smalller than expected


I love this dress. I'm 5'2", about 110lbs. This dress fits great and feels wonderful. I wear a pedi coat under to give it that vintage flair. I get so many compliments on it.


The dress is exactly the same as it is shown. I am size 6 small US and ordered small which fit perfectly.


I love it. It is a beautiful dress. Well made. I received many compliments on this dress all night. People thought I paid much more for it than I did. Love, love, love it!!!


The material is really cheap and didn't look nice when I tried it on. While the photo looks great; it doesn't look as great in person. Also the material for the skirt is really stiff and uncomfortableâ€‹.


Love this dress. Fits very close to size.it's very heavy material but very well made. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Just beautiful.


beautiful dress!!! great quality!!!


This dress is beyond beautiful. I cannot wait to get paid to buy more from this company. I was blown away with the quality of this dress considering the low price. I would definitely buy again.


I ordered this for a funeral and had a TON of compliments!!!  I wish it had pockets - then it would be perfect :-)


Many compliments on this dress - it's a darker blue than the picture (true navy I would say), it looks very rich for the price.
