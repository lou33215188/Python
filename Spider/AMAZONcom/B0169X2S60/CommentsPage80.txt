Beautiful sexy black dress. I love it


I love this cute dress,  is very stretchy and as other reviewers, I will suggest get your right size, I'm not sure how durable will be but so far it doesn't look that's is made with a bad material.


Beautiful dress! I'm 5"2, 135 lbs and normally wear a size 4-6 and the small fit perfectly! The material was heavy and quality...received several compliments! Highly recommend!


It's a beautiful dress! It fits as I expected. I am 5'7 and 126 lb. and I ordered Small size, that is perfect. The materials are strong and have a great quality. I am planning to order in a different color, too.


Amazing dress! Wish it came in different colours.


Beautiful party dress. I'm 5'8 and 130 lbs and a size medium was great.


This is one of the most beautiful dress I have seen. Material shimmers, the lace top is elegant. It made me look like a Barbie doll figure. I got black which is my taste in color. Reasonably priced with a good return guarantee.


This is a great dress and does not feel cheaply made.


This fits me perfectly, I am 5'6" and weight 150 I got a medium. It took me a minute to figure out how to get it on comfortably but once it is on it is the perfect fit, will be my favorite go to dress now!


such beautiful material. I love it
