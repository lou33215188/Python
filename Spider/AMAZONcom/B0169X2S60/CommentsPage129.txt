I'm 5'9 and 137 lbs.  It is the perfect length.  It hits me at the knee which is pretty hard to accomplish with how tall I am .

dress fit very nice i love it


It's perfect, hugs the body and the material is very comfortable! It is stretchy so that's Always a plus! It arrived a head of time so that was great!


Love this dress! Fits a little large for me. If you need medium, might need to go small, still looked great!
