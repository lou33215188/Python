I like the dress.  Very classy.


I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress. It fits great.  Stitching is nicely done.  The fabric is heavyweight with stretch to it. Im 5'5" ddd and 170. The zl fits perfectly and hits right below the knee.


Runs large and the build is too stiff.


I'm very happy with the fit and look of this dress.  It's comfortable and flattering.  The fabric has a little stretch to it.
