Size runs a bit big, but other than that the dress is beautiful and material is great!


Looks great and wears well! It is breathable and semi-flowy.

Thanks to everyone who previously posted reviews.  The feedback convinced me to take a chance on this dress for a recent company function requiring cocktail attire.  The dress was well made and looked very nice for the price. I did have to take it to the cleaner for a quick professional press, but it fit my body type (pear shape) great and I had many compliments at the party.  I'm 5,1' and about 145lbs so I ordered a large.  The fit was great and hit right at my knees.  I was worried that it would wrinkle in the car, but it held up well and looked nice all evening.  I honestly did not think the dress would be as nice for $35, but I highly recommend buying this outfit if you are on the fence.  Worse case, you can send it back.


I like the stretchy material the dress is made from it make the dress very comfortable.  I also like the look & style of the dress.
