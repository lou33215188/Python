This dress is beautiful. Love the navy. I took a chance an ordered a size up.  Glad I did, I usually wear a 10, but ordered a 12-14.  Fits great.  Very well made and amazing that this structured dress is also stretchy everywhere. It is so comfortable.  So glad I saw it on Pintrest.  A classic for years to come.


It's actually made in a material that's not polyester


it is very nice for the price


The quality of cloth is not so good. The package in which I received the dress was wet and smelled.


The dress is beautiful and looks very professional, but every time I wear it a stitch starts to come out in a different place.  I'm afraid to wear it again.


do not buy this dress.. very disappointed. Poor Stitching.. not what I expected to get .. fabric is hard and not appealing..bought this dress to wear for a wedding and now need to look for something else .


This dress is absolutely stunning!  The lace is comfortable, not at all scratchy like some lace can be. The skirt has a nice weight to it. If you're wearing it out on a windy night, you wouldn't feel nervous about it blowing around. I'm so happy I bought this dress.


Very comfortable and beautiful. Quality of material is amazing. I feel so pretty in it.


Love this material (soft and stretchy and so flattering!!)!!


Beautiful dress and well made.
