Beautiful dress looks very classy. I'm 5'7 185lbs. And ordered an extra large and it fit perfectly.


I love this dress.


Beautifully flattering and comfortable dress!  I can't wait for a chance to wear it again!  Just make sure you have time to do lots of ironing after it arrives.


Beautiful dress! It fits very nicely and is comfortable to wear.  The skirt part was very wrinkly upon arrival so I needed to have it dry cleaned prior to washing it.


Lots of bang for your buck.


Boy did I get compliments when I wore this dress!  Very feminine and quite comfortable!


Nice print, size runs about one size bigger than ordinary store department sizes, I got a Medium and it fit like a Large.


Pretty dress, just not the color I needed for the wedding.


Perfect and very good quality


I wore it to a New Years Eve Party and I got so many compliment.  It fit beautifully.  Thank you.
