So cute!


I was very pleasantly surprised with this dress!  I didn't think it would fit as well as it did, but I am very pleased with it and the quality of it... Especially for the price!


Cute


This was the first time I ordered clothing online and I was very surprised that it fit so well. The dress fit like a glove but also hid all of my problem areas. I am 5'4", 150lbs and ordered a Medium. I will definitely order clothing from this company again.


I mostly adore this dress, but there is one detail that I find disagreeable. The little belt detail in front is not removable and makes the dress look cheap. I'm disappointed and will be returning  the dress, unfortunately. Fits as expected and all other aspects are wonderful!


I couldn't be any happier with this beautiful dress, it fits like a glive and the quality you get for the price is unbelievable, I love this dress!


I'm 5"1 and bought this very skeptically. Every time I wear it I receive compliments- it's a winner.


I'm 6' tall 170 lbs.  This dress fit like a dream and hit right at my knee.  I was a little nervous buying from a company I didn't know and it being such a reasonable price, but It was perfect!


Looks better in the picture


So much too small - I can't even get into it. I feel that the sizing was way off.
