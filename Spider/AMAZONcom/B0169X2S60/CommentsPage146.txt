This dress is beautiful! So comfortable and so high quality, it's even better than I expected. I can't wait to wear this for an upcoming wedding! I am between a 10 and a 12 and I ordered a large, it fits perfectly.


Fabric is much richer than I expected.  I also like the give in the garment.


Absolutely beautiful dress! Does seem to run a tad big. The quality of the dress is excellent. And you can't beat the price.

Beautiful dress, elegant. I'm 5 ft 5, 180lbs, bought Large size and it fits like a glove. Love it.


This is very fabulous for the price. If ordering you have to go a size up...I normally wear a large and I ordered XL...the fit is perfect... Going to purchase the black.


Nice dress. I like the lace top.


Love it! Material is so comfortable. I'm usually size 16, so I order a size up just like what most post sugest, fits great. Wish it had more colors to choose from.
