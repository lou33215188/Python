I love it but it's a little big I should have got s small


I love it! It fits perfect. I'm 5' so it goes pass my knees but I like that it doesn't hug my pouch and comfortable.


I hope my GRANDDAUGHTER will take care of it


Really love this dress. Wasn't sure what to expect but very happy witht the quality and the fit for the price.


Very nice dress.  A little tight in the bust.  I'm 5'9' and usually wear a size 6. But, overall it was a very well made, nice dress.


material was thin and poor quality...dress to small


Love the outfit


Beautiful dress, I love it!


I loved wearing this dress for an occasion I had go to.  The dress is very beautiful and I had received a lot of complements on it!


Got for my mother, good quality
