This dress was perfect! I have never had so many compliments in my life!


Bought this for my wife! She loved it!!


So much thicker and heavier than I thought it would be.


Beautiful dress and fits perfect!!!


Looked great


Fits perfectly


Fits very loose in the waist compared to the bust.


Cute dress but not for me.  The skirt part was stiff and I'm not used to that, I like swishy but it's a well made dress.  The fabric seemed to be on the heavy side which I thought odd for a dress but you definitely need to go at least two sizes larger than what you normally wear, at least two sizes.


Nice dress
