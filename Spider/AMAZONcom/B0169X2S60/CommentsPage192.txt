Loved it


Very good quality. Lace was better than I expected for the price.


The fit was perfect but the fabric was not the greatest quality.


This dress is amazing and so flattering.


❤️ It!


Not even one star. This dress is a joke. I ordered an XXXL and it won't even fit over my breasts. So disappointed I wasted $40.00.


Sizing on these are very inaccurate. I ordered this dress by the seller's sizing guide. The XXL came and was smaller than the XL of the same exact dress. The XXL had a US size tag that said it was size 12, and the XL had a US size tag that said it was a 14.


Cheap dress. The zipper is total crap!


I simply love it! It makes me look really elegant and beautiful!


I like the dress it's just a little too snug.
