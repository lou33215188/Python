I absolutely love this dress!  Some places are tight,  but that's just my body.  I'm transitioning from an 18 to a 16, so I'm sure I'm about a couple months,  it will be perfect.


Dress looked nice and fits as expected. The only thing I didn't like was that the navy blue is a lot darker than I thought it would be and under certain lightning, it almost looks black.


This dress is gorgeous, well made, and a steal at this price!


Beautiful Dress , i love it! Im 5'1 and 130lbs and i got a size small, the only thing is that the lace in the top of the dress can pull. It might need to be wash by hand.


Very nice tailoring, color and fabric. I normally wear a size 10 on the bottom and 14 on the top. The size xxl fits perfect.


Such a pretty dress it is.i just love it


This is my favorite dress, so beautiful!


Way too long I look like a nun but very beautiful comes to mid shin


I was extremely pleased by the fit and quality of this dress.It did arrive wrinkled but once I knew that I would be wearing it I brought it to our local dry cleaners to have it pressed. This will be one of my favorite go to dresses the little black dress with class.


I was iffy about buying this dress even with all the great reviews. I'm so glad I did! It fits well and looks beautiful! I'm going to check out all of the others made by this company. That's how much I love it!
