Beautiful dress and well made. However, 2 sizes too small and I am returning for a refund.


I love this dress. It makes me feel pretty and confident when I wear it.


This dress would be very long on someone under 5'7" or for someone that had a short torso and long legs. The waist of the dress sits naturally high which works to the advantage of someone with a short torso, but the skirt is so long it does not fall like in the picture. It would go much further past their knees. Also, I would think this dress would not look that good without the petticoat. It seems to be of high quality though, very sturdy thick fabric and the lace upper is very forgiving. As others have stated, it is quite wrinkly out of the package, so make sure you plan ahead for that if you need to wear it quickly.


I was pleasantly surprised in the material. Very nice quality!


Just as described! Can't wait to wear to Christmas Party!!


I love it!
