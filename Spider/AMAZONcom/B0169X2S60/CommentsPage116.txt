Ordered blue got black fit excellent just not the right color


Love this dress!!!


Love this dress! I'm 5'3 about 200 lbs and ordered an XL and it fit perfectly. Definitely recommend.


This is a gorgeous dress and so flattering!! I am 5 feet and 220lb. This dress made me feel very confident.  I got so many compliments on it. Highly recommended


Love the top. Hate how the bottom puffs out in front.


I was worried this might be too long waisted, but it fit my 5'1" frame fine.  The stretch in the fabric helped.


I love this soo much, just that I should've gotten a size smaller...except that there isn't one!

Love this dress very sexy gave me a smaller waist.


Fits great, looks great at distance, up close much of the lace came damaged with lots of snags.


Beautiful dress, quality material. Would order from this company again.
