Dress is fabulous! You just can't find clothing as unique as this in stores. I would normally never taken a chance and bought dress on line for special occasion but if you measure yourself and order according to size chart you will not be disappointed. I've not been this excited to show off a purchase in a long time.


Very cute, classy and surprisingly confortable


I don't often write reviews, but had to make an exception, this dress is perfect fits better than expected, love the material, to be honest I love everything about this dress, wish they had it in red I would order another one.


Gorgeous dress. Felt like a 60s girl. The skirt wrinkles really easily, so iron really well.


love this dress!  Make sure you use the size chart, I had to order much larger and it fit perfect.


Ran too small and was too short.


Great buy! The dress fit well and wore well. I felt lovely in it!


I ordered the medium. I am 5'8'' 130. It fit, but not as well as I would had liked. the waist of the dress was too big, as was the space under the arm pits. I really like the dress though in terms of style and quality, so I returned the medium and ordered a small. Hopefully the small fits better.


fits well, i'm 5'10 and ordered a 14.  It's a cute dress, heavy fabric, for the price it's a good dress


Absolutely love this dress!  Very well made and the style is beautiful.
