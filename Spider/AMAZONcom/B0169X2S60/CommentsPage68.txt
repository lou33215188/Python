ran about 3 sizes to small. returned.


Beautiful and looks like a million dollars (not the incredibly inexpensive price I paid)


Great quality and even better price. Very stylish. The fit is perfect


I wore this dress to bartend a wedding and it was amazing! I got compliments all night long! I ordered a medium dress and was a little skeptical because my bust is so big I usually have to order large dresses but the medium fit prefect! Definitely gonna order through this company again.


Originally ordered the XXL, but it was much too big. I got an XL and it fits as if it was made for me. The skirt material is much stiffer than I had expected, but it's gorgeous and looks well made.


I usually wear a size 14 dress, and am an hourglass shape. GET THIS DRESS, you will not regret it.


This dress is really nice.  The lace is a good quality and it fits as expected.  I do have to return it just because it is not a flattering fit on me.  I knew that was a possibility in advance, but gave it a shot.


This dress is beautiful on! I wore to a Christmas party & Christmas Eve church service. Multiple comments.


The item was also very wrinkled upon delivery.  More care with packaging would have been appreciated.  Highlight the material that the dress is made out of.  The picture of the dress on amazon.com is beautiful, but when I receive the dressed I was disappointed.  I expected better quality.  Hopefully my next items will arrive in better condition.


This is my new favorite dress! It was very comfortable and we'll made. I loved how heavy the fabric was for the skirt. I highly recommend this dress!


I just want say I love this dress. Thank you to all those who left very detailed reviews. My husband and I went to a wedding today and I received many compliments. Great fit for all body shapes, great price, and great fabric.
