OMG I love this dress!


I am thick in the midsection so never wear belted things - this dress looks awesome on me! I worried about the lacey stuff - but it is soft - read the reviews - they are all spot on - so happy I bought this!


Wife loves it!


My daughter loves her new dress.  It fit's perfectly on her and the quality and material is much better than expected.


My daughter got this for her birthday and looks fantastic in it. It has some give, a little stretch, so it fits her perfectly.


Purchased this dress for my daughter, who is a 0-2.  It fit her beautifully.  Really gorgeous dress.


DO NOT FIT AT ALL!


Beautiful dress


I need to wear a tank top under it because I don't like to show my bra in public. It's very comfortable. I ordered a larger size because of reviews and I am glad I did. My husband said it is beautiful on me.
