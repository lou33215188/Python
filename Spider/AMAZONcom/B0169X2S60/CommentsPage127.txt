Awesome dress fit me like a glow got so many compliments I love it


What a beautiful dress....hard to get wrinkles out of dress form packaging...otherwise I love it!


A little snug as your putting it on, but once it is it's wonderful to look at.ğŸ˜Š


Best dress ever!


It's a beautiful dress, I am Apple shape, heavy on top, 5'4, 160 lbs and 38D. After reading reviews  decide to get large. It was PERFECT! Really happy with the dress!


Huge! I ordered a medium and I am 5'3", 130lbs. It looked like bad curtains. The shoulders could have fit football pads underneath and the hemline was mid-calf.


Runs small, especially the sleeves.


Dress fit perfect.....beautiful dress


I get so many compliments when I wear this dress!!  Love this piece!


my mom loved it
