I was a little disappointed in the fit of this dress but it may be my body, who knows


Very comfortable and flattering dress


I love this dress, it fits great and looks great! I usually don't have great experiences with buying clothes online so I'm thrilled that it fit well. I'm 5'2" & ~180 lbs with a 36" waist & the XL was the perfect size. I also have rather bulky arms and was a little concerned that the sleeves would be tight, but they fit perfectly & comfortably. The chest might be snug on anyone larger than a C but it looks great when mostly unbuttoned anyway. The skirt material is sort of cheap feeling but it looks good & none of the material bothered my sensitive skin.


I didn't have time to dry clean so I dampened the skirt with hot water in the shower & gently pulled around the bottom of the skirt to loosen the wrinkles, then let dry on a hanger. It worked out well for me. :)


This fits tight/snug bug the material has more give. The skirt is quite full. It comes quite wrinkled in the packaging. I have to give it a second look. It's somewhat classy and sexy.  The wrinkled packaging has thrown off my opinion.


I really love this dress! I am around 110 lbs, 5 ft. and the small fit perfectly. I purchased the royal blue color dress. The length fell just below my knees. I got a ton of compliments as well!


It was cute, but did not fit my long torso. Returned with no problems.


Delivered on time, nice fit, quality construction and material.  Care instructions are a little confusing, dress label says to machine wash, tag included with dress advises no machine washing.  Will hand wash.


Very cute.  If you have "junk in the trunk" don't bother with a petticoat.


Exchanged the dress for a larger size, is still a tad small but totally wearable. It's gorgeous.


Loved it.
