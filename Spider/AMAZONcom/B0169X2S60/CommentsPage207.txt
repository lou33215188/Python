I love this dress!!! Great quality!!


Very very nice


This dress is worth getting! I was afraid the lace would be stiff and scratchy, but it is so soft and stretches easily. And the material is thick and lays nicely. I received a lot of compliments on this dress when I wore it to a dinner function. It's timeless, classy, and I felt beautiful in it. I'm 5'7 and 150 lbs and I ordered a medium. I highly recommend this dress.


It's a good fit


Love it...


I love the dress.


This dress is great! Stretchy material and comfy. I got a lot of compliments on it. I'm 5'4, 150 lbs and got a Large and it was a bit too big on me but still looked good.


I read the reviews that it runs a little big so I ordered a small over my normal medium and it was perfect! I'm 5'3" 135 lbs athletic build. Be careful with the iron though and you will need to iron it as it comes out very wrinkled from the packing. Came very quickly though! I melted the collar a bit with my iron on steam setting. Take your iron off steam. No one would notice though. Otherwise seems like it will be comfy. Can't wait to try it for the Bridal Shower event I bought it for!


Love it!


Beautiful dress.
