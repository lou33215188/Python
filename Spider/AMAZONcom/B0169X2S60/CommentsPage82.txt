This was my first online clothes purchase in a long while and I couldn't be more satisfied. Thank you for that. I will purchase more in the near future.


This dress was a little on the big side, but still really cute.


I am 5'3' and 158lbs, I purchased the large.  This dress looks great on, fits great and does not feel cheaply made. The material on the skirt is thick and heavy, not cheap feeling at all.  Perfect!


I absolutely love this dress! It is adorable. I love the fabric and the lace is very soft. Also in can wear a normal bra with it so yay!


For the price this dress is absolutely worth it. I ordered a large, which I normally wear, it's a bit snug. The length is just below the knee. The skirt is not lined, but thick enough yoy don't need a slip. Seriously for the price buy the dress


The material is of great quality and I love the slight stretch. I purchased the dark blue just to get out of my rut for black. I'm wearing this to a casual country wedding this weekend, maybe with a pair of cowboy boots! Lol..


My husband wanted me to get it, he loved it and so do I! It fits great,  classy and classic! The stretchy material is a definite plus!


Love this dress. Comfortable. I'm 5'11", 165lb. 38 C cup. I ordered large. Fit well, not too short. My only complaint is it was snug around my breast & made the buttons spread apart. I sewed them together. Material stretchy so that fixed the problem.


This dress was beautiful.  Unfortunately, I wore it for a police funeral, but I got a ton of compliments.  I am 5'3, 34C, and about 130lbs.  I got a small and I fit perfectly.


I absolutely love this dress! I bought the navy one and every time I wear it, I receive so many compliments from all ages (my coworkers and my students).
