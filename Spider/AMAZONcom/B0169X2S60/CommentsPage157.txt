The color is a bit darker than on the picture, but other than that it's a nice dress.


Love this dress. You can wear it to any occasion. I'm petite, 5'7,120lb and order a size medium


I love this dress! It is very flattering and comfortable. The material has some stretch to it.


You met my expectations ' Love the dress '' fits just right!! And pretty fast shipping.... Would definally order again.

Beautiful dress


Love this dress absolutely gorgeous for any occasion really worth buying


Totally love this dress


The fit was accurate. The lace top was really cute but I didn't expect the bottom part to be really stiff. Almost like the top and bottom weren't supposed to go together.


The dress was nice but the sizes run small.
