Beautiful dress and the sizing chart is correct. Also, the customer service was great!


I could not love this dress more! it slims my waist and has such a retro flare. It fits fine (little tight in the elbow area, but it unbuttons)


This dress is so cute!  Love It!  Got a small for my daughter who is 5'2" and 103 lbs. And it fits her great.


Love, love, love this dress. Fits comfortably, and held up all night. The skirt is full and has some poof to it. You could wear a petticoat underneath for more volume, but it is definitely not needed. The top is very pretty and comfortable. Wore to a formal occasion, and was comfortable all night.


I havent worn it yet. But as soon as i put it on my husband reacted. I really like that. Not cheaply made.


I chose this dress to my wife as a Valentine's present and she loved, it fits very well and looks amazing on her! I recommend this dress!


I love this dress.It fits well and very nice stretch.


Love this dress! It fit great and looks amazing!  Like other reviewers have said, the lace part is stretchy and the front buttons are functional. The waist band is slightly high than you would expect, but it looks great! Fits true to your normal size


The dress fit my sister perfectly. This is a size two and my sister is rather skinny.


Wife loved it
