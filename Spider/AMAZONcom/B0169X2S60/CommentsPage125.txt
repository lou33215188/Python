Loved the dress. Looks really nice and classy.


Lovely dress!


Beautiful vintage style dress. In love with it.


The dress is very nice and elegant. However, I had to return it because the smallest size was still some kind of big for me. I am tall and thin, 5.9 and 114 lbs.


nice dress


Immediately as I opened the bag the quality of the material was the first thing that I noticed. It's amazing. The fit and color are perfect.


I am 5'1/ 185 ibs, XL fits me perfect


Prefect fit. Lots of compliments.  True to its size. Am a size 4 orded a small PREFECT . Material will last a life time. Black is always elergant. Brand is great.


I love my dress.
