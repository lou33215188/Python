This dress is absolutely fabulous! I got so many compliments on it. And if you're curvy- it shows off the curves in all of the right places. Great for a wedding reception or a fancy evening out!


Everything fit as expected, the only thing I'm not crazy about it the end Center of the attached belt. It is not cute at all, but this can be covered easily with another belt. As far as everything in the description goes this dress met those expectations.


Really nice, had to return it for the next size because It was a bit snug in the bust area. Love this dress.


Beautiful Dress, well made..stunning!
