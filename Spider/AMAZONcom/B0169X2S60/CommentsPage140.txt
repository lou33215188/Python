Dress material is nice but runs large for my body shape


While I loved the dress it the fit in my waist was too large...the dress looked baggy on me. Nice dress though...


I used the dress For a wedding, and I got so many compliments. Size Fitted  little big but still Look wonderful.


I truly love this dress,I got complements all day long.


Love the dress! I'm 5'4" and 147 lbs and the medium size was a perfect fit. The waist line is a tad higher so the flare of the dress hides any little tummy bulge. Can't wait to wear it on my trip to NY!


OMG this dress is beautiful. I can't believe the high quality for the price of this dress. It's very high quality. Came on early on shipping too.


Not as bright blue as the picture. Also needs to be wore with a pedicoat or will be to much fabric to wear alone.


Great fit and fabrics! Perfect for a dressier event with the comfort of cotton. Blue is gorgeous.


I am 5'4 145 lb size large, I ordered a small after reading the reviews and it fits perfect. Is a beautiful dress and really good quality.


This dress was absolutely perfect!! Fits true to size and is very comfortable to wear. Definitely happy with my purchase.
