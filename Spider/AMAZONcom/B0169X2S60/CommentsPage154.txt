Beautiful dress.  The fabric is quality and tailored nicely.  It's a dress you'd easily pay three times as much for at a department store.


Love this dress!!


Fits pefect! Wore it to a graduation and got a ton of compliments.


Cute dress. Fits as expected. The lace detail is very nice and not itchy at all.


Big girl with curves and tummy, this dress is super flattering.


It fits perfect for my wife but the dress is too puffy due to stiffness of the material. This is just me and my wife's opinion.  However, we will still keep it.


Love it,love it!!!!


Beautiful Dress, and fits great!


Soooo cute! I got so many compliments!


it's pretty, but wrinkles too easily and care seems to require a lot for the pleats...
