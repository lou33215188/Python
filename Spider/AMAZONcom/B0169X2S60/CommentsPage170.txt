A gorgeous dress.


I love this dress! It is so cute on  :) I received so many wonderful compliments on this dress.  I will attach photos later


Can't really comment on the fit as I couldn't get the dress on.  Too small to fit over head and shoulders.


Dress fits perfect! True to size chart.


I LOVE this dress! I will definitely be ordering more from this store. It's so classy!


Love the stretchiness of this dress


I give it 4 stars because I don't like the feel of the skirt fabric. Overall it is a cute dress. Can be worn to special occasions. Material is stretchy, which makes it very comfortable and easy to move around in.


My wife loves it. Very nice quality materials


I really like the material and the 1950 style. I am 5'5 and 127. the medium size fits perfectly


Very stiff fabric and though I ordered small using the sizing chart, the dress was huge. It felt like I was wearing a bag.
