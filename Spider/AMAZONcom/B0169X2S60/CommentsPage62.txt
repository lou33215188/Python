Read a lot of the reviews first and actually found a few that had my same measurements, so ordered what they did. They didn't disappoint! It fit like it was made for me. I will be wearing it in the coming week and can't wait!


Wore this dress on New Year's Eve and loved it.  Dress is comfortable.  Based on other reviews I bought one size larger and it fit perfectly.  Washed the dress in washing machine on gentle cycle and hung to dry.  Steamed the dress to remove the wrinkles and it looks good as new.


I love this dress, the belt (attached) was too big, but the top fit fine.


Based 0n the reviews I went up a size.  Fits and looks really cute on.  I am getting a few more!


Lovely.  Will be wearing this dress over the holiday season.


The dress fit very nicely and I liked it for the hour I wore it. However, I started breaking out in a rash from something on the dress and had to return it.


Another great dress. Got so many compliments! Was even able to layer a black turtle neck under it because it's winter. Looked super cute!


I'm 5'5" and 125lbs, I actually felt like it could have been a little more fitted, I was worried about going with an extra small though because I didn't want it too be too tight. But it is a good fit.


It is a pretty dress but runs small. I ordered a size bigger than I normally wear and it is a bit snug.


My wife loved it.  She said it was sized accurately.
