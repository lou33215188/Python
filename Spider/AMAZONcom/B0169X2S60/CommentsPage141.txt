Love the dress and the fit. I have a small torso so the waistband is a bit too big and I'll have to adjust it. I'm 5.8", 125lbs and I took size small.


very nice dress. my only complaint is that it needs to be iron because it came too wrinkled .


Beautiful dress


Beautiful. I get so many compliments. Good construction. My favorite dress.


You might wear this if you're going to a funeral... for your grandmother... and you want to dress like she did.


It fit me perfectly!  It is perfect for the swing dances my husband and I go to.


Beautiful dress! One of the best dresses I've ever bought. I usually wear Medium but after reading the reviews I decided to get a small and I am glad I did. Very nice!


Well constructed, nice heavy fabric, it does run a little long. Washed and lightly dried (just to remove wrinkles) - no shrinkage.


Dress looks great on my daughter and fits comfortably. She totally loves the dress! We would recommend this dress in heartbeat. Suggest that you measure and double check sizing. Purchased an XL originally but went back and got the Large for a better fit.


The dress zipper should have been the kind that zip all the way down, instead of in the middle of the dress.
