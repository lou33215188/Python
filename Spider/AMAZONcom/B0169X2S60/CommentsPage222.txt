Not quite right for me. The waistband was up on the widest  part of my rib cage. Not my natural waist. Too bad I love the dress.


My friend bought me this dress to wear to her wedding and it's fits perfectly. I am 5"5 at about 195 pounds with a bra size of about 36D. I am always usually skeptical about buying clothes online but was very pleasantly surprised!


I love this dress ! I wore it for my home coming dance and a band dance I had . Looks amazing and the fabric was soft and movable with . You would think it's a hard material for the lace part . But it's stretchy and comfortable. And I don't like dresses I'm more of the tom boy type . But if mine ever breaks (which I doubt ) I will surely buy again !


I love this dress. I am a size 8/M and I got a medium and it fits perfectly. When I first opened the package and saw the dress, I almost regretted the purchase but after I ironed it and the pleats were neatly layed and added an additional gold belt, I couldn't help but fall in love with it. I got so many compliments


This is a beautiful dress. Material is well made and does have some stretch to it. Wish I had bought a small.  Sadly it was slightly too big. I am 5'4, 130 and ordered a medium.  The top fit perfectly but it was a bit big in the waist and a tad bit too long.  If I had the time I would have taken it to the tailor to have it hemmed just a few inches.


I love this dress. Has stretch and nice in person.


I have requested a return label and ordered the next size.  the function I ordered it for is past, but I love the look and feel of the dress so much; I decided to replace it to have for the next event.


Dress fits amazing but the sleeves are too tight to be 3/4 so I ended up rolling them up to be above my elbow so I could bend it without having the fabric almost rip


Had so many complements fir as expected


It fit exactly as expected. I'm 5'0" and 165lbs. Really nice dress! The cloth was of a surprising quality.
