I love this dress!! It's so stretchy and soft, very comfortable. The lace isn't scratchy like other dresses,it feels nice.


A beautiful design and quality below the waist however the lace is very delicate and already tore as I was pulling the zipper down. Tend to fit one to one and a half size smaller then all my other dresses of the same size


The small is more like a medium.


Great buy


I loved the dress. I ordered a small. It fit perfectly.


Perfect for teenager. Can use with or without slip.


Everyone said the dress was beautiful


Really pretty!! Way stretchier than expected which is great for comfort but Iâ€™m gonna have to take in the waist a bit. Arrived early, good quality. Happy with this product!!


I bought a large and I'm not a large woman. The cuffs are about 1/2" away from being able to button and the bust gaps because apparently my 34 B's are too hard to contain. Probably still going to wear it. Just gonna tack the front closed and hope I don't pop open in church!!! The dress is very pretty and the fabric is sturdy.


Very nice dress! Like others, I wish it came in more colors! Can't wait to wear it. It fits as expected. Will definitely order other items. I'm wearing mine to work!
