Cute dress, good quality for the price. I get lots of complements on this!  Impressed.


FIT ME WELL


The dress fit just like I expected.  I received so many compliments.  The dress was made of great quality.


Excellent dress for the price. Beautiful color. It received many compliments at a wedding. One caveat, while the dress shows up in the petite listings, it is not petite. I'm 5' tall and it was much too long so I had it hemmed.


As described. Thick material.


This is a fantastic dress. Requires ironing, which I hate, but it is so flattering and comfortable that it's worth it.


I always get compliments.


What a beautiful dress! I could not stop spinning! So comfortable and flattering. I'm a big girl and this dress is incredible


Does not fit like the image, but still very flattering. Excellent buy for the money.


This dress is absolutely beautiful.  It material is lovely. Very high quality. I received many compliments and my husband loved it. I wore it to a wedding and dancing was great as it twirled beautifully.
