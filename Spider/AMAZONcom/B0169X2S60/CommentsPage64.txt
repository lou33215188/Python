I love this dress. It's so comfortable. I'm 5'10 and I bought a medium and it fit perfectly.


Fits good but glad I got a size bigger. I'm 4 weeks post partum. Normally a medium but got a large, covers up post baby bump nicely. Also it is great for nursing!


Love this dress it fits nicely can't go wrong buying it


I purchased this dress for a wedding in a pinch and I love it!  It did run a little large and the fabric is kind of stretchy so if you are right on the cusp of sizes (like I was), I would recommend going for the smaller of the two.  Truly a beautiful dress for any special occasion!


This dress is nice also. Same material as the other dress I just bought. I love it and if you had another color I like in my size i would purchase it.


This dress is stunning! Very thick durable material, very stretchy, and very comfortable. Any time I wear it I get tons of compliments- this dress really helps give that classic hour glass shape! A great dress for the price.


I get loads of compliments in this dress. =)


Adore this dress and get sooo many compliments especially from my hubby he told me I should buy one in Esch color


I  Kept ordering a bigger size there was not much different  I kept ordering because i liked the Dress..


Great price and great quality! Dress looks very expensive! If your not sure which size to go with...  go smaller. It's very stretchy! And very figure flattering.
