This dress was absolutely perfect for the wedding and I can't wait to wear it again! Fits in all the right places and I felt so freakin adorable in it!


I was worried it would be a little to small in the shoulders but it fit perfect with enough room to feel like i wasn't being squished!


its perfect fit for me. :)


Just love the way the dress fits and hugs my curves in all the right places. The fabric is stretch but perfect in weight. Would love to see other styles in this fabric and colors...maybe a fitted dress.


Wore this last night for the first time. Fit exactly as expected and looked great. Very comfortable dress and is now a new favorite!


AMAZING DRESS! AMAZING PRICE! I usually spend a lot of money on my dresses and have to alter them quite a bit.....I didn't have to do a thing to this one. Really Happy


Great quality, looks just like the picture, and comfortable material too! I might order another on in black too!


Flattering with lots of compliments.  There is stretch - get the larger size if you have bigger arms or thicker through the middle.  If you are thicker in the hips/thighs, you can stay true to size.


The dress is better quality than I expected. I never bought a dress online before. It did run a little big or I lost some weight


I chose size small based on several purchaser reviews, but when the dress arrived it was very large and the fabric was quite stiff.
