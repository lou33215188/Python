Well made.  Fabric is heavy.  Runs a little big.  I normally wear a size 6 dress and debated between a small or medium.  Glad I went with the small or it would of been huge.


I am barely 5 feet tall, so he dress hits right below my knee.  This dress is so beautiful!  Love it!


The material its made of looks legit,not cheap! I like how it fits me and emphasize my curves. Beautiful for weddings,semiformal or even funeral!


a beautiful piece of dress.


Absolutely love this dress and received many compliments on it at the occasion I purchased it for. Very pleased with quality, fit and material.


Originally got a large which I had to return for a medium. I'm usually a 8-10, so that wasn't a big deal. Great dress.


Pretty dress. Very wrinkled when it comes out of the packaging. Decent quality.


I get so many compliments in this dress. I wear a navy colored tank top under it for work.


My daughter love it, great quality. Thank you


I should have trusted my gut and ordered a Medium instead of a Large, but this dress still is so very pretty.
