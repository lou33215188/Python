Gorgeous dress! Boy, did I get compliments. A good friend even went immediately and bought the same dress! I love it, love it, love it.

Absolutely WRINKLED from packaging--hard to iron the pleats!!!


Sent back. Cheap and small


It's a great dress for bigger size woman. Very elegant and comfortable!


Too small but good quality and the style was vert nice.


Fits well, nice quality. I have not wash it yet. But it seem it will hold well.
