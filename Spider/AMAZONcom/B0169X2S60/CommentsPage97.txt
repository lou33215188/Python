I LOVE this dress! Perfect fit, very flattering! Quick shipping!


Beautiful dress. Good quality. I am 5ft1 and 130 lbs. Dress fit well.


So cute and fits perfectly. Very well made too.


Did not return because didn't try on befor discarded tags


adorable, fits a little smaller than expected


Little snug but my hubby loved it beautiful  dress


The dress is really beautiful, with or without the petticoat. The material is nice and thick and it doesn't look cheap at all. I just ordered another color. Will probably order all 3 colors. I wish they have it in red too.


flattering, has some give


Good product, arrived on time, as described and pictured.  Thank you!
