This was not at all what I was expecting.  It has a very high waste and was not as nice a the picture.  I am going to return this item.


Heavier material, beautiful lace. I'm having trouble getting the wrinkles out but it's simply lovely. The waist could be a smidge tighter but I'm so happy with this purchase. I'm 5'5" and ordered an XL.


Love this in the wife.


A little snug across the bust. I ordered blue and got black. Had to stretch the top part to get it on. I liked the pleats , the length of the skirt and the waist fit well. My husband liked the way it looked so it's a keeper.


I loved the top of the dress, but the pleats in the dress made me look huge, sent it back.


Super beautiful though and a really great quality, so I will definitely be swapping the sun out for a smaller size because this is a must-have


Bust was too large for me, really cute dress


Fit really would recommend.


I liked the style, however it fit smaller then the actual size, I guess because it is so fitted. There was no room for a bust. Also the skirt poofs out quite a bit, doesn't sit flat like in the picture.


Bought this for a wedding in navy blue.  Paired with red stilettos  ğŸ˜� it's perfect.  I'm 128lbs 5'1  36b and it's perfect
