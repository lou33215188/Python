Love the material but it was a little snug in the bust area


Considering the price this dress is made well, and looked very nice on.


The tip part was a little tight (l am a 40C) and the bottom was a little big. The skirt material is heavy and the pleading didn't flatter my figure. It's a beautiful dress, just not for me!


Loved this dress.  I got so many compliments.  Great buy especially for the price.


Very short torso and small bust


this is by far my favorite dress! Fits perfect and make me feel beautiful!


Have not gotten a bad review of myself in this dress.  Fits great, feels comfortable, looks more expensive than what it costs (way more).  I would buy this again if I could.


Poor quality


Love this dress! Fits great. Love that the lace stretches because I was worried about it fitting my arms. Beautiful dress and I got a lot of compliments when I wore it.


My wife loves vintage dresses and this is her favorite of the ones she owns.
