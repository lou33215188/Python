This was way too tight in the chest area and way too large on the bottom. Pretty dress but the material on the bottom was too much.


Thank you.


The arms are incredibly small. I cannot button the sleeves at all and the material is a bit stiff. but it is very cute otherwise.


Love this dress! But I still can't get the creases out of it from the shipping. I normally ware a 1x but got a 2x and it fit perfect. Very flattering cut for a larger lady like myself. Has a build in tanktop for behind the lace. Very comfortable. Just wish I could get those creases out.


Love this dress.  It is even better in person than in the website photo.  Classic, elegant look for affordable price. Very comfortable stretch material too.


Bought this for my daughter who is 5' 11" and 150 pounds for PROM. Got a large. It's good quality fabric and nicely constructed. I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a nice dress.


Very attractive piece but it almost resembles a funeral piece if you don't add accessories, such as a belt


Really nice dress! Surprisingly stretchy. I'm 5'6" 145ish lbs and I'd ordered a Large and the Medium. The large had a few inches of room around the chest and waist. The medium is great! The dress is well made, nice solid fabric, perfect for a navy blue bridesmaid dress. It came very wrinkled so I'll be ironing it before I try it on with a picture


Beautiful color and style. The bodice fit very well, but the skirt was too full for my body type. Very good quality construction and materials.


Beautiful dress! I love it and receive so many compliments at my cousin's wedding renewal/ 50th birthday party
