OMG! This has been the best and very-well made dress I have ever bought from Amazon. The quality of the fabric is terrific and it fits me well! I will wear this on my upcoming commencement this month!


The bottom of my dress fit.perfectly, the top wouldn even button.


This dress was beautiful. I have a pear shape and this dress worked very well for me. I got so many compliments.


Amazing and beautiful dress. I really love it.


Beautiful dress and very flattering for my post baby body.  My only complaint is that the belt is attached twisted and won't lay completely flat.  However, because it is a very dark navy it is hard to tell.  It would be easy enough to fix if I were so inclined.


Terrific, perfect with the petticoat! Can't wait to wear it! So glad I ordered it at this bargain. This is a very study dress! I will be getting more of these! You can get so many looks by changing colors with this! I am 16w and got the 2x and it fits like a glove!


Dress fit perfectly! Wore it to a wedding and received so many compliments. Love it for the price!


Perfect fit! Love it!


This dress looks and feels very cheap.  It's going back.  I don't recommend it.


Beautiful dress. I'm 210 lbs with a large chest and I ordered a size XXL. Fits perfect.
