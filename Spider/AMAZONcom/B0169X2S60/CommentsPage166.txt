I get compliments on this dress all the time!


I love, love this dress! It is somewhat heavy and will be perfect for the fall or winter!!


This dress fits perfectly and is very classy!


Beautiful and I felt so beautiful in this dress. It may be my favorite dress for now in my closet.


I didn't like the style on me and it came a little large.


After reading reviews and viewing pictures of how the dress fit others, I decided to order one size up. I love this dress. It fits perfectly.


Itâ€™s beautiful! Better than expected !!


Love it!!!!


I love it. I am 5'7' and 155 lb . I was worried about XL for me would be too big, but it is actually about right. it's just only a little bit bigger. I also like the quality of the  sleeves that are flexible.


Beautiful!
