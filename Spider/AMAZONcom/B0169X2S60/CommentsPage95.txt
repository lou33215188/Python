This dress is beautiful, classy, elegant. It can be dressed up for a party or wedding, but also can function as a work outfit. Color is beautiful and the fit is very flattering. It can hold up its a-line shape with or without a petticoat. Love it!


I love this dress!  I've washed it a couple of times and it has held up perfectly.


Love it, fits well. I'm 5'3 150lbs. Received wonderful comments.


It is a little tight in the bust and a little large in the waist. Could not have been able to get a larger size. I think I will be able to wear it.


Nice dress- loved the top half of the dress but the bottom material was a little too stiff and thick for my liking.  It also was too large so I had to return it so I recommend ordering a size smaller than you think you would wear.


The dress is even more beautiful on. Love the fit. Material isnâ€™t too thick or thin.


Wore to a funeral and it was gorgeous. Should have went a size smaller


Good quality dress and classic look. My daughter loved it and has received many compliments on it.


I really wanted top like this dress. I'm 5'6", 140lb, and I wear size 6 to 8 in dresses. The medium was way to big so I exchanged it for a small. The small for ok, but the threads were coming apart....:(


Thought it looked like an old ladies dress. ğŸ˜�
