It fits super well and I love the way it hangs. All it needed was some time hanging to get all the wrinkles out, but other wise was just perfect.


Beautiful dress and fit was just right.  Material was difficult to iron.


The dress was really beautiful but it did not fit me.


IF you can get a size that fits, it is a cute dress


Perfect fit...Love this dress!!


I am 5' 3" and weigh 135 pounds. I ordered a small and it fit perfectly! Definitely buying from this company again!


Looks very stylish, nice material


Great dress!


Love it! Especially the stretch, so that it fits chest AND waist perfectly.


I'm 5'5 and a half. 168lbs medium build. Size 12 for pants but,  very busty 38DD so I usually wear a 14/XL or XXL on top.  I like to be comfortable in my clothes and so took a chance and ordered the XXL with this dress. It fit perfect!!!  The buttons don't look like they are coming undone on top. The dress hangs perfectly when on. The fabric is stretchy on top. The dress looks fitted on top and not tight at all.  I have average arms and the sleeves are comfy. Not tight. The dress has the right amount of flare. I'm not bottom heavy. I got this dress to wear at a gala and it's perfect. Happy with my purchase.!!!
