Too much fabric for me..


I truly love this dress..I can say I would highly recommend this. It's unique yet vintage. Totally amazing.


The dress looked nice but it was so small I couldn't even button the top. I'd suggest ordering up at least one size.


Love this versatile dress! Nothing bad to say about it. I received tons of compliments. I wore it to a funeral and it could be dresses up to wear to more formal occasion too.


Looks great, but there weren't enough buttons. Everything else fit perfectly, but the bust was a bit tight and created a bit of gap.


Love this dress. I got the blue and it's a true navy. The lace part has some stretch and it's also got a back zipper. I definitely ordered up, using their size chart. Based on the chart, I needed to order an XXl. I usually wear a large-Xl (14-16). The XXL fits perfectly.


The material is nice, substantial. The buttons are functional. There is no lining in the skirt, but that doesn't detract from the fit. I'm 5'6" and the skirt falls just below my knees.


I wish this came in more colors. I love it.


I cannot tell you how much I love this dress! It fits amazing! The material is wonderful! The way it fits, it makes me look awesome! Would absolutely recommend!


Really like the dress the bright blue color is so pretty and it feels really soft on.  I ordered my actual size 2xl and it fits well with a very tiny wiggle room.  I am keeping the 2xl because the size chart for the 3xl are too big for me and I do not want to spend money in the alterations.


This dress is perfect! I get tons of compliments on it, it fits very well, and I need to get it in the different colors. :)


This dress exceeds all expectations.
