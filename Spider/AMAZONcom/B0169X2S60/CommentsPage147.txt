I loved this dress it fit really well! I do wish that at least it was a little easier to put on.


Best buy on Amazon to date.


I has to wear this dress even though I squeezed into it. I got compliments and stares. I said my body didn't do any justice to the dress but others didn't think so. Real cute dress and I had fun wearing it.


It was good


Very nicely made but it runs small. I usually wear a size 10 or 12 bought an XL and it wouldn't go around my chest. Sent it back and ordered an XXL.


Fits Perfectly.  I wore it to a wedding, and I got many great comments on it.  It's a beautiful dress.


I absolutely love this dress. Received lots of compliments while wearing this dress. I wish there are more colors in this dress.
