Oh my gosh I LOVE this dress!! Bought for my nephewâ€™s cocktail attire wedding and itâ€™s perfect. Sized up based on other reviews and it fits great! Super flattering on the waist for my full figure. High quality at a great price.


Very nice dress! I bought this dress to wear for my daughter's baptism. It was perfect for the occasion and fit very well. Material is very nice and easy to care for.


This is a lovely dress and fits like a glove.  I wear a size 18 and purchased the 3XL. I am an apple shape and while nothing I wear will hide my roundness, this dress does look flattering on me. The lace is beautiful and the buttons are sexy.  I would buy this dress again!


Amazing fit on my girlfriend ğŸ˜�.


Great quality but it was too small so I had to send it back


poorly fitting


Fabric feels nice and study unlike some lace items.  Love it!  It's long because I'm so short but I like it this way!


Momma is lookin good


This dress fits perfectly! It's very well made,  the material is stretchy enough to compliment your body and curves (even a lack thereof)!!! Perfect for work!!!


I'm 5'8" and usually wears medium for tops. I ordered a medium and it fits as expected. Material is very stretch and it falls just above my knees. However, if you are curvy on the top, should probably go with 1 size up than your usual. I'm 34D and I'll probably need some safety pins by the buttons on the top to secure it.
