This dress is beautiful on.  It fit perfectly and the material is something that will last.  Very happy with my purchase.


I could not be happier. It's always so scary ordering something new. This was perfection. The color is beautiful.


Absolutely love it. I get a compliment every single time I wear it with heels.


I was excited when I ordered this dress and absolutely not disappointed when it arrived.  It's a beautiful dress, with quality fabric and fit perfectly.  I can't wait to wear it!


Beautiful dress!!! The dress came very wrinkled, but that was an easy fix.


I am 5'11, weigh 165 and have hips and a butt. Because of my shape I bought a size Large and it was way to big.. I should have bought a size Medium. I have a wedding on Friday so kind of in a bind and will have to wear it too big.. Don't have time for alterations.


Color is beautiful. Fabric is nice, not to light or too heavy.I wear a size 18 so I bought the 3XL and it fitted perfectly.


My fiancee loved the quality and fit of this dress.


This dress is gorgeous! I couldn't believe the quality when I opened the package.  It was true to size and very comfortable. I ordered a petticoat because the skirt is full and I think it will lay better.


A beautiful dress.  I usually wear a size 10 but a large is perfect.  It is a Lovely blue color!
