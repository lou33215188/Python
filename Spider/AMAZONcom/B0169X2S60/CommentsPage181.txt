I liked a lot. Looks very good. Thanks.


Really good quality for the price. Easy to wear and looks very nice on. Exceeded expectations.


Does not fit as expected, fabric is nice quality but does not match picture in texture.  Very stiff.


excelente!


Fits a little snug but overall very happy


The dress was ok, I read comments and decided to order. Its not worth the money in my opinion. Material of the dress is really ruff and hard and the dress it self pretty heavy for a dress. My problem with this dress is seller is making it really difficult to return it, if you won't like the dress and gonna want to return it, GOOD LUCK, they are making me pay for the return label. So think really hard before buying it if you really want to go thru all the hassle try to return it.


I felt like a princess in this dress for my birthday party. Celebrating 30 never looked so classic, yet sexy!!


Perfectly gorgeous!
