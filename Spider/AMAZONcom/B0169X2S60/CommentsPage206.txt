Love, love love this dress!


This was my first time ordering clothing from Amazon, and I was very excited about this dress. It was so pretty on line.  But I was let down.  The first thing I noticed was that I ordered a Mismay dress, but I received a Miusol dress. I don't know their affiliation but that was the first thing I noticed.  I ordered the Royal blue dress, but the lace was lighter in color than the dress. According to the measurements this dress should have fit. The dress felt very awkward.  Just as others said in the reviews, the waist was very high, right under my breast.  My breast size is 40D I am only 5'1'' tall.  The seams in the arms felt like they were cutting into the back of my arm.  It will have to go back!
