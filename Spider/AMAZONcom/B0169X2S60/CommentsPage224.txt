Love this dress! It fits just like on the model very true to size. Only downside is it needs ironing before wearing so that the skirt portion looks absolutely wonderful


It was beautiful, but it was too small for me. I ordered a medium. The buttons at the front would stretch out and look like it was way too small and tight.


Love the dress. The fit was just right and the material is thick and of great quality. I have both the blue and black.


Cheaply made!


Perfect fit and very well made. Very happy with the quality.


Fits true to size and it's comfy. The lace does seem delicate so I handwash this dress


Very impressed, Fits beautifully, Good quality


Perfect birthday gift. I'm pretty short (5'2) and busty at DD and an XL fit me perfectly without the clevage flying out. Love how it looked too, it's adorable and comfortable!


This dress fit perfect and it looks great.  Perfect for any event.  Thanks so much.
