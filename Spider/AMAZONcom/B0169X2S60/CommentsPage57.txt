I love this dress. It looks like the advertised picture and fits well. It's only getting a 4/5 because I noticed a few loose threads when trying it on. Other than that I'm really happy that I purchased it.


It's as beautiful in real life as it is in the picture!! It fits amazing, so happy! I was really pleasantly surprised by the heaviness and good quality of the fabric, definitely worth it.  I'm 5'6 and 148, the medium fits great!


Sexy. But elegant sophisticated. Just love it. Fits perfect. Am a little top heavy so I had to return for a size up to fit across my chest no problem the return was fast and easy.


Perfect gift, its all one piece an is a very heavy material


Size runs small. Very heavy as well


This dress is WAY too big to be considered a size small. The skirt part is also very wrinkly and wouldn't travel well.


Very nice


I purchased this dress for my rehearsal dinner.  It came rather wrinkled, but was absolutely gorgeous!! Despite the wrinkles, I LOVED IT.  It hugged in all the right places and was loose in the all the right places!!


First dress I've ordered online. LOVE IT.  Did not expect such quality workmanship or fabric. It fits beautifully.  Has just enough stretch to flow comfortably.  It is my first retro fit-n-flare. The pleated skirt sways nicely with the just-right weight of the fabric. This wil be a forever dress in my closet. I will buy this brand agsin.  Skirt requires ironing but worth it.


It hugs the curves well! but poor quality.
