When it arrived (very quickly!), I was excited to try it on.  However, it didn't fit correctly in that the waist line of the dress didn't align with my body's waist line.  So I returned the item.


It's a really pretty dress! But it's super heavy and it's A LOT of black. There's a clasp in the front kind of looks like a belt but it doesn't come off so I can't add a colorful belt to it. But overall it's nice.


I like the dress. I wish it was a little longer, other than that it's a good buy for the money. Dress has to be pressed before you can wear it....but looks good once pressed.


Absolutely Love!!! Very Flattering! Usually wear a 16/18 and ordered a XXL. The dress fits very nicely!


Love this dress, well made for the money. The problem for me was it was way too short waisted, it fit more like an Empire. Sad, really because it is so nice!


LOVE IT!  It fit great and I got TONS of compliments.


Love this dress.  It's comfortable, classic and affordable.  I'm using it in a wedding but it fits so many occasions that I will be able to wear it for work and leisure.


The pleats in the back exaggerated my butt, which I can live with but I didn't expect.


I loved the dress and it fit perfectly. However, I took the dress off and one of the straps inside the dress came off.


The only reason I gave this 3 stars is due to the lace tearing apart way earlier than expected. Definitely looks great on and I received many compliments while it lasted.


This dress is beautiful.  It is made with high quality materials and it arrived quickly.  I really do adore this dress.
