I very like this dress but I have to return it because it is too tight on by the arm. I need to order a biggest size. This dress is make from China. So ppl from USA would need to order a biggest size.


Love the dress! Fit good. I really like that the lace was stretchy material. It gave my arms room to breathe and loved the length as well. I wear 38DD and wear large normally. I ordered large and it fit great!


Flimsy. It arrived with a seam coming apart.


Absolutely beautiful.


Wow!!! Can I give this dress more than 5 stars? So happy with this dress! Attention all curvy girls: This is a must buy! This dress looked fabulous and I got compliments! I recommend buying a petticoat for the best results. Runs true to size.


Really cute. Fit perfect.


Cheap looking I returned this item


Fits great, I ordered XXL, I'm usually a size 16 dress and it fits perfectly. I love the waist band and collar. I also have more muscular arms and the dress has plenty of room for my arms, very comfortable!


nice fit well
