Totally wrong dress and wrong size.  I did not reorder.

Love!


Because of other reviews, I bought this dress in two sizes in case one fit better than the other. I'm 5'4'' and about 140lbs; I found that the medium fit a lot better than the large (the fit was better in the waist and bust). The sleeves are not too tight and the length fits perfectly to my knees. The quality is a lot better than I expected (I'm always cautious buying clothing online and especially dresses!). It's a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone!


I received many wearing this dress.  It's not made with cheap thin material which is usually the problem I have when it comes to dresses featuring lace. It looks exactly as pictured and fit comfortably. I have worn this to work, church, date nights, etc. It's an all around dress. Absolutely love it!


Extremely  disappointed  that when ordering  the dress  the size chart is way off. Also upon  return  I have to print off return  label  and drop off at ups  unless I want to pay to have it picked up if size chart was correct.
