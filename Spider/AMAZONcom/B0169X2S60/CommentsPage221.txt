Dress was very low quality material, only resembles pictured item. Cheap course cotton material that is stiff as a board and doesn't flow at all. Picture makes you think it sits well and flows, but that is not that case at all. Returned immediately.


I love this dress - it's beautiful, it's comfortable and bonus for mamas you can nurse in this dress - only problem I had there was when I filled up someone could see skin if they were standing to my left side (just because of how it buttons.) no biggie though I just where a black under nursing top. I would recommend and I would buy from this company again. ğŸ˜€


Great fit!!


This dress is absolutely amazing. Material is great quality and it fits very well. I am 170lbs and 5"6 and I ordered an XL.


Nice dress, well made. Disappointedly,  I had to return it. It was cut very short-waisted, so pleats we're not flattering to say the least. If you have a longer torso, probably not the best choice.


I was so excited to wear this dress, but the waistline hit about an inch higher than my waist.


The fabric is beautiful and substantive. It came to  my knees which I like,  and the 3/4 length sleeves were perfect. To bad I had to return it. However, it should work great for ladies with long waists.


I ordered a large I'm 5'3 usually a size 10


Just as I was hoping for! :D


Totally Unsatisifed. I ordered this dress two times. In my experience, the size chart is NOT true to standard US size charts or what was listed. I didn't have time to return the dress so I bought another one in a much bigger size. The second dress came not only without the required buttons but it also did not have the button holes!!


This dress was so cute. That I had to tell my friend where I got it, in hopes that she would order it also. It fit nicely, I'm 5'8 and wear a 18/20. The swing of the dress hides what needs to be hidden. All the reviews and pics really helped me make my decision. I wore this dress to church and received compliments on how cute it was.
