Classy dress I took pictures with this dress and the royal blue is amazing


Very cute, but material is a bit stretchy around waist, I should have ordered sz down.


Love this dress, modest, cute and fits great.


This dress is amazing fits perfectly. I normally wear a 1 XL order 2xl to be safeatured fit was awesome.


I purchased this dress for my stepdaughter graduation it fitted her well and it looks great on her the fabric is what I expected it to be. I would recommend this dress to everyone!!!


If you love 50 vintage this is the perfect dress

Short on the torso.
