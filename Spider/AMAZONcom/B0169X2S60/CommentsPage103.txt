Wonderful dress, very classy. I've worn this dress on many occasions and have received several compliments regarding dress.


The fabric isn't to heavy, and the lace has a little stretch to it. I'm 5'6" and the skirt hits just around the knee.


When it arrived I was surprised by the volume of the cotton skirt. It was extremely wrinkled and unless I want to iron and starch it, it will not be able to be worn. I will need to return.


This dress is awesome! I am 5'6" and 130 lbs. I am smaller on top than on the bottom. I ordered the small and it fits great. Flares perfectly over my hips!!


The zipper is sewn on upside down AND it’s defective. It won’t zip up or down.


Good


I love this dress. Not only do I feel great but I look great too. This dress is very flattering and the quality is really good especially for the price.


I am 5'1 and 160 pounds. I ordered a large and it is a perfect fit! The material is not cheap. I absolutely love this dress! Would love to buy in different colors.


This is a really pretty dress, but it arrive extremely wrinkled. It smells really bad as well. It looks exactly like the picture, but the delivery is extremely disappointing. I wouldn't buy from this seller again.


This company makes the best clothing. I will always order from this company. It arrived in perfect condition and fit as expected.


I really love this dress and its of good quality material.I am 136 LBS but it's quiet small.Have to return it for a large size
