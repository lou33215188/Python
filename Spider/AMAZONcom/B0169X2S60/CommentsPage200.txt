Perfect material and very flattering


I loved this dress! After reading the reviews, I was kind of hesitant, however, I am sooooo glad I made the purchase. The dress fit as expected. I kind of have a big stomach and this made me look flattering! It also didn't show my flat behind lol!! I got a lot of compliments and I will definitely purchase again. The only con was that it was very wrinkled, however, a low steam iron worked just fine. FYI: I ironed it inside out!


I asked for women's size and got Missy extra large. The dress is cute but I can't wear.


Fits perfect!


My wife and she loved it


Though a bit tighter fitting than I would have liked, The dress is very elegant, form fitting and good quality over all.


The dress was beautiful


Thank you


It fits perfectly. I ordered the 2XL. It's extremely comfortable.


Loved it! And I never buy clothes on here! Very pleased
