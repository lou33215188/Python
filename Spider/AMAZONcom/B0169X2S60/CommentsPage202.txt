Great Dress- comfy and lovely.


So pretty and fits just right.


I'm 5'6" and a 36D. I ordered this in XL to accommodate my bust,but it was just way too g all over, but I LOVED IT, so I exchanged it for a Large and now, though it's just a bit tight across the bust, it fits everywhere else. Hits just below the knee. I put it onwith a crinoline and it looks adorable!


The fabric and construction is super high quality. I feel like this looks like I got it at Talbots and spent $200.


The sleeve caps at the end each have two buttons. I undid one button to roll up the sleeves a bit because they felt a bit long, and because they were a little itchy, but rolling each sleeve once was perfect!!!
