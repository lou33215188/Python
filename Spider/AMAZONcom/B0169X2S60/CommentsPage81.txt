bought this dress for my girlfriend. The rate was at 78% fitting. The dress is somewhat stretchy and fit her perfect and looks beautiful on her.


she's a medium and fit her very well. Another dress we bought was at 46% fit and ordered a large and it fit her perfect too. So we know how this system works.


I love this dress! The material is good quality as is the construction. I wish I would have gotten one size smaller only because the material is stretchy and I feel that would have fit just a bit better.


I got so many compliments wearing this. I can't wait to buy more from this brand.


It's beautiful but sizing was off.  I wear a medium in everything but should have got the small.


looked wonderful.  didn't fit me


In general, I like it. The quality is as expected. Size is true.


This dress is perfect! I was really worried about what size to order a M or L (I'm 5'3" about 150 lbs) and because of another review I decided to order a M. I'm so glad I did because a L would've been too big! The quality of the fabric is better than I expected and it looks amazing on! I can't wait to wear it and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!


Beautiful dress, nice color.


Size chart is wrong! Size up one more then it says


The dress appears nice quality for the price. I ordered a large according to the reviews but returned it because it was to big. The medium fit but didn't care for how it flowed, the belt is not adjustable so it fit weird in the waist.


Lovely blue.  Soft fabric.  Very flatteringly on an amplechested hour glass figure.
