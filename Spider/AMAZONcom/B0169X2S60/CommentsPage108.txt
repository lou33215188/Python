This was ok but not what I was looking for


The picture isn't what it looks like in person


The material is not quality & im sending it back


Incredible qualit and detail . Super comfortable. Awesome detail and drape to fabric. Could not be more satisfied.


I am 6 feet tall 180 pounds. This dress in a size 2x if it's amazingly well.


I cannot compliment this dress enough!! Its absolutely gorgeous, fits great and slims me down and the fabric and stitching is very good. I am definitely getting more from this supplier / label!!


Size medium 5' 1" 120 pounds fits perfect, I haven't wore it any place yet but I'm told at home it is beautiful on me. Easy to iron.


Looks great, fits perfectly , well made, nice fabric


Item was as beautiful as described and shown in picture unfortunately even though fit on bottom it was very tight in the chest area. I would recommend maybe ordering a size bigger if possible


This dress looks great on my daughter.  She has received many compliments. It is comfortable. Just beware of washing it the first time.  Fabric dye bleeds alot.  The tags do warn about this.


I loved this dress


So this is my absolute favorite dress now! I want to wear it everyday!!  its very stretchy and nice. I went out to show my grandparents and they both said it was a very nice dress and that it made me look very nice. I feel so good in this dress and I''m totally going to look for more dresses tha are somewhat the same!
