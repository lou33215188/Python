I just received this dress and it looks more Navy blue then bright blue. I have attached pictures for the color reference of my petticoat I am wearing under it to give the dress a little lift. I called amazon and I would have to return it and reorder it but since I need it for this Thursday I am stuck with it. Buyer beware of color differences and I read a lot of the reviews before I purchased it.


This is not a dress I would usually pick out for myself, but I was drawn to the vintage look and am so glad I got it! It'll be perfect for a friend's winter wedding!


This dress is gorgeous. Looks as pictured. I just had a baby a couple of months ago and I am not really feeling like clothes fit all that great but this dress fit wonderfully, looked great and was pretty comfortable as well.

I took a chance and ordered a small based on the size chart provided. It fits me perfectly! The quality of the material is very nice. It's modest but not dowdy. I received many complements on this dress.


I went off the size chart and some of the other reviews and this dress was much too large.  I love it but will be sending it back for a smaller size.


I just got this dress today and LOVE it already! It fits great and looks good on my "fluffy" body. I ordered a XXL thinking it probably wouldn't fit, but it does, and it is super comfy. It stretches a bit through the cinched area so it doesn't feel tight and restricting. I can't wait to wear it. I wish it came better packaged so it isn't so wrinkly, but I will iron it and get them out easily. Great buy!


I ordered one size bigger than I normally wear. I measured all the places necessary. My measurements should have fit the size I ordered, but it did not fit my chest at all.


I gave it 2 stars because it is a pretty dress. The color was true and the stitching was well done.


I ordered a size larger than I usually would based on other reviews and I'm glad I did. I absolutely love this dress though!! It seems to be high quality and the fit is very flattering.


I loved my blue lace dress like this so much that I just had to get the black one.  This dress is so flattering and comfortable and made well.  I wish they had them in a rainbow of colors because I love it so much.  It's classic and feminine and sexy without looking trashy.
