snagged on 1st day but cldnt bring myself to return. its utterly beautiful and soo incredibly comfortable to wear. i always get compliments (post pushing that snagged material in!)


It was so comfortable and adorable. I could easily unbutton and nurse my son as needed. I can't wait to wear it again!


This dress fits amazing. Material is nice heavy quality feel. Color is a rich navy. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Plan on wearing to a wedding ina week and a charity benefit the following week.


Longer than expected


Cute and surprisingly comfortable!


The lace is soft and stretchy and the front is designed to cover your bra so there's no need for the added layer of a camisole.  Great dress for the price


We love it!  My husband and I adore it!  I bought the petti-coat to go with it, and


i feel so pretty  He cant keep his hands off me!!


I liked this dress. But, I did not like the material on the bottom. But it’s srill a nice dress. True to size. I am 5’4” 150 pounds and I ordered a Medium and it fits.


This is a beautiful dress! Great fit, great quality.


I'm 5'5 weight 125 pounds and got a small size. Fits OK but a little big in the back where the skirt starts. It's classy and pretty


It is beautiful!  Looks exactly as shown and I received a ton of compliments on it!  Thank you!!
