Absolutely loved it. I’m on a weight loss journey and thought this dress wasn’t going to fit. I’m 5’9” 225 lbs and the 2xl looked fantastic on me. Will now buy in different colors.


It's a beautiful dress, but be careful when ironing. The material feels a bit rough and plasticy which makes it very easy to burn the dress. Also, Missmay needs to come up with different color options. It's usually blue or red.


The top was an excellent fit and looked fantastic. The skirt poofed out in the back and looked very awkward. No way I could wear it that way.


NICE DRESS, STYLISH. A BIT HEAVY. GOOD FOR COLD WEATHER.


Fit great everywhere but in the bust. If I went a size larger it would fit in the bust but too big everywhere else.


Also, the skirt material is heavier than it appears in the picture


Magical dress. Complements any body type. I paired it with a petticoat. The belt was too large, but the rest of it is PERFECTION!


Great fit, nice dress. A tad long and not a "bright blue", more like navy blue


Thanks!  Looks lovely.  Perfect for the event I am attending.


Beautiful, perfect. The only thing is a long thread came loose after 1 wear.


Great dress for the right person...I found it difficult to get in and out of so I had to return...I'm a Large to XL in most clothing so I ordered the XL and found it a bit small...if ordering, size up one
