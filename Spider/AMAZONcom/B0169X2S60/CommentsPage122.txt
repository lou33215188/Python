love this dress. classy. cute. delivered what they promised. thanks.


This is a beautiful dress, but it is short from shoulder to waist.  The belt was a good 3" above my natural waistline so I had to return it.


Love the dress


Cute fit. It’s hard when your chest is larger than your waist. But it’s nothing a few stitches on the side can’t fix.


I love this dress! I am 5'9" and 155 lbs, bought a Medium and the dress fits like a glove. Well made, feels like a Zara dress. This is my 2nd dress from Miusol and I'll definitely buy more dresses from them. Just have to take it to the Cleaners and, voilà, good to wear! So happy with my purchase!


Very nice quality. Very comfortable too!!


I call this my 1st Lady dress


great dress


I just wore this dress for the first time to a dance and one of the men told me it was "stunning." It really is and fits perfectly. I liked it so much, I just bought another dress from Missmay!


The dress is lovely, but is extremely short waited and I'm returning it.
