Nice quality. Love the fit.


Just got my dress & tried it on. I love it. Can't wait to wear it out. Material is high quality but zipper is small.


The sizing chart is a bit off on this one. I'd recommend sizing down, especially if you tend to hover between sizes. I got a medium and it just had that hand-me-down-a-bit-too-big-for-you look to it. It felt like nice quality. The skirt material is thick and has a slight sheen to it. It reminded me of a heavy windbreaker. It also had some serious creases in it from shipping. I'm sure they would come out with ironing, but it seemed to wrinkle fairly easily. That could be a drawback for some people. This could be perfect for others, but sadly for me it's going back.


I'm a size 16 and ordered an XXL, which fit perfectly.


Good


love the dress, very pretty but, SHORT waisted, there is no room for error


Love this dress!  I always get so many compliments on when I wear it.


Beautiful dress


Fits perfectly.  Very stylish.  Fabric is not what I expected,  yet happy with purchase


This dress was as comfortable as it was lovely!
