Came very wrinkled but beautiful once ironed out!!!


It doesn't look nice on me. I gave it to someone else.


Such a cute dress, perfect for the office or going out!


Very pretty, but not sure I like the feel of the fabric.


Very cute dress! It does run small, so order one size up.


Very nice. The Large is actually a large!


I SHOULD HAVE ORDERED FOR XLARGE INSTEAD OF LARGE


I love this dress!


I loved the dress even though it was a little big for me...


Beautiful dress!  Exceeded my expectations!
