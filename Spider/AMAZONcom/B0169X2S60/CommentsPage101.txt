This came on time and packaged well. The quality is very nice and i got compliments literally very 10 min. all night when I went out! I wear an extra large and this dress compliments all the right places!


I wore this dress to a wedding.  Loved it!  Fits well and got lots of compliments.  It was comfortable to wear all day.


I love this dress. Fits as excepted and looks like the picture.


I absolutely love this dress!! I am 5'1 with a 40" waistline so I ordered the XXL. The fit was perfect. I received quite a few compliments. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is thinking about purchasing.  You won't be disappointed.


I sent it back because of the awful chemical smell. It's also cheaply made.


Just beautiful on and love it  and can't wait to wear it to see Bryan Adams at the Beacon in NYC.


Love it!  Well made, great fabrics, fits just right.


The quality of this dress is so much more than I could have expected. It fits perfectly too!


Absolutely loved this dress. It is SUPER stretch but still maintains its great shape.


The dress is beautiful but the material is not flattery on the body. I am 150 pounds and 5,7, the bottom part of the dress looks cheap compare to the top part which the lace is beautiful.
