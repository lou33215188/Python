Extremely beautiful and great fit! Good quality fabric. Well worth the money.


Very cute, the belt seemed to be a bit high on me, below boobs instead of at waist.


Perfect for cocktails or theatre.


Wore this NYE! Love it!


Very flattering.


Very cute dress and seems to be good quality!


This dress fits like a glove. It makes me look thin. And very stylish.


I love this dress.  It fits perfect.  It has always been hard for me to find a dress that is cute, modest, comfortable and decently priced but this dressed covered it all.


Great dress


I was really worried how the dress would fit because I have a large chest and big hips but it fit perfectly! My husband fell in love all over again :-)
