This dress was great but the zipper in the back wasn't my favorite got stuck a few times trying to zip it up. Other than that it was a good fit .


Love this dress! It's gorgeous and fits perfect!  I'm 5'6 about 165, usually wear an 8/10, 36DD and I ordered a large, medium would have been too small in the bust. Great staple to have, wore mine to a wedding, looked great!


I love the dress....I am a small ..127 lbs.....5'3" so it was perfect.....One downfall.......the wrinkles to the skirt when I took it out of package.....Need some work  on the packaging.


This dress is beautiful and very flattering. It is heavy weight material, but still very comfortable to wear. Have received many compliments.


This is a beautiful dress but the pleats mess it up.  I haven't been able to was it yet as the pleats lee coming out wrong. The material is float.  It's hard and rigid.  I really wanted to wear it.  Sigh


Love the dress fits perfectly, got it for my sister-in-law wedding as a brides maid came really fast and I threw it on as soon as I got it , material is nice and stretchy , I'm just ready to get the wrinkles out and wear it nxt month


This dress is too cute!


This dress is amazing!  I ordered it for an evening fundraising event and I received so many compliments on how classy it was.  I am 5'5" and 175 lbs and I ordered a large and it fit so perfect.  I was comfortable all night long!!  The price is perfect and I would totally recommend this dress as a wardrobe staple.


Little big , but looks gorgeous !!!!


This dress is everything it promised, very stretchy, but form fitting. It was wrinkled when it arrived [to be expected] so I hand rinsed it in the tub, let it air dry over night then tumble dried low the following day and it removed all wrinkles.


I recieved so many compliments on this dress from the wedding.
