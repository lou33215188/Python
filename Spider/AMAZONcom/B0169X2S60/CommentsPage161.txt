Fun to wear!  Fits Great, fabric is sturdy and the skirt is full!


slightly high wasted and I am short but overall like this dress very much. does require ironing.


can't beleive how great this dress fits and looks. perfect for an evening event


I love it. Its exactly what I wanted and fits perfect.


Cute dress but I had to return.  Bad fit for me in the arm area.


My wife looked stunning in this dress!!!


Nice quality, fits good.


Beautiful dress.  Love the retro look.  Received with a snag on the lace I guess due to shipping/handling.  But over all very good quality.


The dress and quality is outstanding, it is still a bit tight from the chest but you can wear an spaghetti tank underneath.


I definitely recommend this item.


Really cute. Like the way it fits. Wore it to church for a christening and felt comfortable in it. Will order from this company again.
