I love â�¤â�¤ this dress! I am 5' 2 about 200lbs and ordered both an XL and XXL. Both fit but I like my clothes to fit so I stuck with the XL. The only issue is that I am a DDD and the top part that button was gapping. But I give this dress 5 stars ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ


Cute! It arrived very wrinkled (in a small-ish plastic bag) so it needed to be pressed. I wore it to my husband's Navy retirement ceremony and I loved how it looked. I'm on the short side (5'4") so it hit me below my knee.


This dress is beautifully made. Slightly larger than I would've liked, but still fits nice. I ordered a medium (I'm 5'7 and 150lbs) normally I wear medium, next dress I order I'll definitely get a small.


I Love this dress, it's so Hollywood Golden Era Classy a must have if you're into the Vintage/Retro look. I recommend you buy a petticoat to give it a more fuller look. The lace detail is flawless. Stretchy material but it does run small on the bust. The only complaint I have are the wrinkles on bottom half of the dress and ironing it out has been a bit of a challenge. I received so many compliments.


This is not like the other dress I ordered from Miss May, this one came from a different seller at a cheaper price, much longer delivery time and ended up being an inferior product, it seems to be a knock-off?  The dress was not made from the expected, thicker spandex material, there was no stretch to this garment AT ALL making it almost impossible to put on with no zipper, the tag in the neck had been cut out!!  I returned it immediately...I will now pay the $21.00 more and order this dress directly from Miss May.


LOVED THIS DRESS. Has IT factor


Bought this dress for a wedding I had to attend. I have never bought clothes from Amazon before so I was nervous about the fit. Due to my body shape dresses are usually a hard fit for me. The reviews helped me pick the perfect size for me. I'm 5'5", 240lbs, very large busted, with an hour glass figure.


I am a 36dd, 31:32 in pants and am 5'7. I ordered a large. I have 13 inch arms and am 21 inches across my shoulders. Dress is knee length and has stretch too it. The lace is silky the skirt is thick. I love it. Very happy. Fits perfectly. Has a half zipper back. Beautifully made!


Omg love this dress ..  Fits perfect size L I would say defiantly order the petticoat  makes a huge difference from flat to flare instantly ğŸ˜� . For my petticoat I went down a size to a medium because I didn't want it to show. Will update with full pic soon ..


Let me start by saying I am five foot one, with the hips of a woman who has six kids. So I was looking for something that would keep all that to a minimum lol


It was badly wrinkled in the package and I had to steam it before ironing it. No big deal. Material is thick, sturdy with some stretch. Sleeves were a tad too long, but again, no big deal. The skirt hits me an inch or so below my knee, and is very full without a crinoline beneath it...very vintage looking. The issue came when I washed it (on gentle) to rid it of that slight chemical smell that new clothes have. Two inches of the seam right below my waist line came unstitched. The collar wrinkled so bad I cannot iron it out. The lace is unraveling and has strings hanging all over the place. I fixed everything but the collar, and wore it a two more times. I was afraid to wash it, but my toddler wiped her face on the skirt at a funeral and I had to. More seams came undone. There are three separate seams that need fixing now. The lace is not holding up well. I am not pleased with the workmanship on this dress, and find that it is over priced for the quality.


However, it is a beautiful dress. I was complemented numerous times all three times I wore it and everyone wanted to know where I had found such a gorgeous dress. It was comfortable to wear, no itchy or scratchy issues with the lace. I could be tempted to buy this again, if the price were closer to $20 than $45, as I figure I'd probably have to resew most of the seams. Otherwise, I'd just try another brand. I just don't see the point in spending a ton of money on anything that constantly needs to be fixed because of poor workmanship.


UPDATE:


I fixed the seams and wore it to church, where my husband pointed out a huge hole in the armpit. Once home, I examined the hole and discovered that whoever sewed that particular part of the dress missed the fabric. There is a two inch bunch of stitches that hangs off the dress by the hole. I'm taking a star away for deplorable workmanship, and will NOT be buying this brand again, regardless of price.
