Bought for my nieces wedding and loved it! I ironed the bottom before I wore it, but was definitely satisfied!


I LOVE it! Was exactly what I was looking for!


I love this dress. Looks really good and expensive!


Just a little higher waisted. I find myself pulling it down as it rides up a little, and I am high-waisted. But it is a lovely dress for the value.


Very pretty, soft material, stretches,  belt doesnt go all way round :/. I order dress, should have went down a size or two.  I ended up giving it to my sister who loves the dress. So pretty.


I feel like Princess Kate in this dress :-) It's so elegant and it fits perfectly!


was smaller then size


The upper portion fit well and was very nice, the skirt is much too full and made of an odd fabric that is stiff and somewhat like hard plastic but not.


I am so happy with my purchase. This dress will surely put a smile in your face and you will feel pretty wearing this.


The material isn't great, came kind of wrinkled but you cannot iron it. The dress is overall cute. If you are a women with a large bust, the top might be a little tight.
