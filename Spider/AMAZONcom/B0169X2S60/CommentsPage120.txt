Fits very nice and the lace on the arms and fabric on the waist is stretchy so very comfortable! Going to wear for my brothers wedding. Beautiful dress!

Love this dress, fit perfectly and was super comfortable.


Very happy . Dress was longer than expected, went down to my calves. Still very happy and love this dress


Fit somewhat bigl but it had a tear on the sleeve


Love the style but the sizes seem to run small. The great thing about this was the speed in which I rec'vd it and the ease in returning it for free thru Amazon's Return policy.


Very nice! Good quality!


The Arms are really tight


Beautiful! True to size chart


Loved this dress! I wore it to a friend's wedding. It fit perfectly, the material was stretchy, I was comfortable in it all night long dancing and having fun! It's a very classy looking dress you can wear it to several different occasions, overall great buy!
