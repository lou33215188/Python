This is a beautiful dress. Worth the price. Looks amazing on. I recommend it.


I love this dress! I bought it months ago and I get compliments on it all the time! I just bought two more just so I'll have them in the future because I love it that much!


same as the others


Perfect fit, dress is as described! So beautiful and was shipped quickly!


It's cute and modest, even though I have more curves than the model in the picture. It's not the most flattering in the back, however, because I have some back fat. I plan on wearing my hair down or using a shawl, and the front is really flattering. â€‹


This dress was a little larger than I was hoping, but only a little. It's a great looking dress and was perfect for the funeral I wore it too. I plan on wearing it to other happier occasions in the future.


Love the dress. Bought it for a wedding a few weeks ago. I'm 5'2, slightly muscular and I purchased size medium which fitted great. I had it slightly adjusted as it was a little long but expected. Pair it with heels and it looked even better. Material was slightly thicker but it was fine. Felt very comfortable wearing them throughout the event. Will most likely purchase from this company again.


I had to return this dress.  The buttons on the bodice were spaced oddly and made the dress gap on me.  Its a gorgeous dress and very flattering otherwise.  I'm broad shouldered and think that may have made it worse.  Bustier or broad shouldered women may have an issue with this dress which is otherwise very flattering and gorgeous on.


A quality dress.  If you are "busty", you should consider ordering a size up. Very tight in chest area.


I love it want another one yes thank you this great for church
