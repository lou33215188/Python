This dress is nice for the price. I'm approx a 32DD and 32 waist and 39.5 hip and it fits comfortably. I always struggle and read reviews closely for sizing because I could easily be a M or a L sometimes even an XL on some size charts. The M was good and you can't beat the price.


I originally ordered a small on the basis of what many people were saying in the reviews, but returned it for a medium.  It is a much better fit and a very classy dress.  My husband really likes it so that is also a plus.  My only concern is that it is badly wrinkled.  I'm hoping that with gentle ironing  and steam will make the deep creases will go away.


At first I was hesitant about ordering this dress but then I read all the reviews and thought I should give it a try! I am 5'9" and 171 lbs, and I ordered a Large. I could have gone with a medium but I'm satisfied with the Large and it falls perfectly. The material is slightly thicker than I imagined but it's excellent for this winter season with a nice long trench coat and pair of heels! Would have been better if it was available in red!!!


Love this dress! My almost-8-year-old son said I looked beautiful in it!  :) It is perfect for nursing my 3-month-old!!! I am 5'4" about 155/160 lbs. I wear a 38D and have a 34" waist. I ordered an XL and it is a little loose, but I knew I was taking that chance. If you are bustier, just size up. If I had ordered the large I think the front button area would have been pulling, but the waist would have been more cinched. Either way, it is very comfortable, nice heavy and stretchy fabric, and the lace is very soft and stretchy, too. You do not need a crinoline for this dress, it already has enough volume with the pleating and the sturdy fabric..Excellent buy, good quality, nice fit!


5'4, 130lbs with 39inch hips, 27inch waist, and 38inch bust. Dress in size small is loose on my waist (a shame, could look super cute if a bit more cinch!) but comfortably snug across the chest. I like the fabric and color, so mainly just posting a review because I know it helps me to see reviews from people with similar measurements!


I am wearing it Jan 29 2017 andwill t g end write  a review after having it on for many hours for  tradeshow.very wrinkled when I received and required much preparation while pressing the pleats.the fit was very good but receiving it  on a hanger prepressed or folded with pleats organized would have been given this purchase 5 stars!!!


i am 5"10 and 235 lbs got the x large.  It is a little tiny bit snug but i like the fit.  It works for me and makes my waist look small.  Beautiful dress!  Length is good for someone tall too.  Blue looks wonderful.  Good quality


Very pretty dress. Weighs a lot and comes very wrinkly. The dress did not work for me because I am 5'9" and the attached belt landed in an awkward place between my waist and chest and flared out too high making me look pregnant. Would work better for average height.


Is a beautiful  dress but it was to big for me. I ordered a small. I am 5 4, weight 130lbs.  My chest is 32, waist is 30, and hips 38. I should have ordered xs.


Received today for a special event I'm going to tomorrow. Very classy. I normally wear a size 14-16 in US women sizes. I ordered a size 2x because I was afraid and prefer bigger than smaller because I'm curvy on the bottom. I could've ordered a size 1x or maybe even an extra large but it'll be fine, too cute to send back. Order your regular size ğŸ‘€
