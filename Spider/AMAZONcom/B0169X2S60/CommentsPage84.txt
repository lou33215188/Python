I didn't quite like the belt but that was just a personal preference of how it looked on me, and it was easy to remove


Bought this dress for my girlfriend and she looks and feels amazing in this dress. It fits her perfectly and is true to size. She is 5'7" and 130 lbs and I got her a small.


This does run big and long but it's beautiful.


I'm a size 14, 5'7". The dress cut is flattering (maybe a little long), the material is thick with a nice stretch. I could not button it. I'm a 36H.


Kept it so I could wear it on date nights; not appropriate for work.


I ordered 4 dresses from Amazon for an upcoming event. I had not ordered from them before but figured with the price one of them would work. This dress was the winner! The material is a great quality and it fits perfectly! I will absolutely order from this designer again!


The breast area was a little small for me but the dress fit beautifully everywhere else. Some threads starting coming loose, but overall quality is good.


I got so many compliments for this dress! I wore it for Easter and everyone kept asking me where I got it!


I ordered a medium and I'm 4'11 / 30 inch waist / 130lbs /  34 D


Gorgeous!!  A million compliments.  Color is perfect, fit is perfect.  Wore as a bridesmaid.  Everyone loved it!


Dress was pretty  I had to send  it back because it didn't look good on me


Very nice dress. Felt very well made. Fit true to size. I ended up returning it, because I bought it for a wedding, but the style didn't quite fit for a wedding.
