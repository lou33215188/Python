I ordered a dark blue dress and received a dress with partial black fabric and partial dark blue fabric.  It was clear that the dress was not made with one cohesive color.  Which is a shame because the dress is super cute otherwise.  And it's a little bit stretchy which makes it form-fitting yet still forgiving (flattering).


This dress is gorgeous!  I went one size up from the size chart and it fits wonderfully!!  I was scared the arms would be snug because that is a problem area for me, but they fit grear. I will need to steam out the wrinkles but other than that it's perfect.


Good deal for price. I returned as it was too big.


This dress is just as pictured!  I highly recommend it!  I love it!


This dress was awesome! It looks so expensive. The material was nice, not flimsy. I usually wear a size 16. I got a 2x and it fit perfectly.


Very nice stretchy material, very figure flattering, love it! I'm under 5 feet, size 14, love how it fits. Great length. Highly recommended.


Fit is great. The material is comfy and stretchy. The color Navy show in picture is a bit lighter than what I got. The quality is great! So happy!


Classy looking, comfortable, elastic belt line for good fit, will wrinkle easily


Quality is excellent. I ordered a medium and it's too big for me :-(. I'm 5'4" and 135lbs. 36-30-39. A small would be great. I'm so sad. Will prob take it in. Will definitely order for them again
