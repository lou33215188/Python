I really like the way this dress looks while it's on, but I almost asphyxiated getting it on and off.


Love ❤️ this dress is Beautiful and very well made!. I will buy more from this seller :).


Lovely dress, fit good, just a little short for my style. I'm a below the knee kinda gal.


This dress is adorable.  I have been stopped by many people wearing this dress to ask me where I bought it.  It is extremely flattering.


Great high quality dress. Would definitely buy a similar dress from the same manufacturer.


Love this Dress!!! I have had so many compliments!!! I am quite busty, 40 D, and the XL fit perfect!!!


Really looks nice.


Fit was okay but the material was stiff and uncomfortable.  Returned it the next day.


Love the dress!  I went off the size chart and now that I have the dress, I feel like I should've ordered the medium instead of the large.  Otherwise, gorgeous dress!!


I am size medium and the dress is medium so was perfect for me.
