Wore this dress to a gig and received many compliments on the dress! Perfect fit, perfect color!


This dress is awesome! My husband and I took Santa photos with this dress and I wore it to my sister-in-law's wedding. Needs a petticoat if you do buy. I bought a black one.


This dress is perfect. It's beautiful on and so comfortable. Based on other reviews I bought the XL, I'm 5'7" 175# and it fits exactly like it should. I love it!


Looks great on


I love this dress. It fit beautifully, but be careful when you're putting it on to make sure the tank top straps (built in) are on your arms properly or else it may cause serve armpit discomfort.


Three star be because for the price the skirt material could have been of better quality. A very nice pattern and the lace though synthetic is of good quality. Wish the skirt quality was better than the heavy synthetic and that it draped well.. qite heavy and stiff and was a pain to take out the wrinkles


Bought this for Valentine's Day banquet at our church.. and it was more than perfect! I got so many compliments on it! Im a size 6/8 and the medium fit like it was made for me!! The price, the value, the look.. everything was amazing!! Can't wait to wear this again!!!


I am thrilled with this dress.  It's so pretty.  The fabric quality is Amazing. It's heavy enough to lay right. I ordered a size up from what I normally wear bc I have a large bust. Definitely recommend that. Will be ordering another color ğŸ˜Š


BEAUTIFUL! EVERYONE LOVES THIS DRESS


Very flattering! Hoping to wear it to a wedding this fall. Fits as expected. 5'7" / 130 lbs, bought a small.
