Great dress for a great price! I needed something for a family function and ordered a dress from Macy's. It was almost $200 and did not fit... in a panic with only 5 days to go, I ordered this. It arrived 2 days before my event and fit like a glove! I love the stretchy fabric; it wasn't loose, but moved with me. It was great.


Returned it. I ordered a small and it was too big. The dress wasn't flattering at all.


The dress is very nice, materials are good, overall good quality, fits nicely. The one issue I have is that the material is a little stiff (not a poor quality) so it needs a petty coat underneath.


Love this product! I lost it, as well as all of my belongings, during hurricane Harvey. As soon as I am back on my feet, I will get another one!


Can't wait for an occasion to wear this, looks great!


Larger fit then expected. Which is a shame because its a beautiful dress.


Love this dress!  Good quality and the material was stretchy so I felt comfortable.  I would purchase more from this company.


Do not trust the washing instructions! I was going to use a low heat iron to iron the pleats and the skirt started the melt. The skirt material is super nice and slightly heavy material, but the nylon/spandex in it does not like to be ironed. The packaging I had already thrown away as it was a gift so I couldn't return, thankfully I think I can hid the slightly melted spot, left an iron print, inside a pleat.


This is a very lovely dress. I don't recommend for women with larger busts, because the buttons on the bodice kept popping open for me.


This dress was perfect! The fit was amazing, the quality was wonderful. Can't beat it for the price!
