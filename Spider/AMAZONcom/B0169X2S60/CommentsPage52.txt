I felt like a princess in this. Re Kate Middleton's style.  The fabric is stretchable and feels very comfortable. I'm saving this for my birthday. Highly recommend. The medium was quite roomy and I'm 5ft 3 135 pounds.


Very pretty dress. Nice construction and details. It seems to be sized smaller than normal. Lace details appear to be durable.


Perfect dress for Christmas/holiday parties and winter weddings! The skirt is heavier than typical dresses, and didn't budge despite windy conditions. Very classy and I love that I don't need to wear a bra with it! ğŸ‘�


It's a bit big but it still looks great. I bought a petticoat to go with it and ended up giving it to a friend as this dress doesn't not need one. Wore it to boyfriend's company Christmas party and had many compliments on it. I'm 5'3 180 lbs and usually wear anywhere from a 16 to 20 depending on the brand, I bought a 2X and fit well. It's a tad loose but I'd rather have it loose than tight. Based on the material I probably could've fit in a 1X


Happy with how quick it arrived. Beautiful dress. Bought it for my daughter and it looks great on her. Size chart was spot on with her meserments and size. Very pleased with how well it is made. Material is soft and stretchy. Makes it very comfortable to wear. Lace top is well made and has beautiful detail. All in all its a gorgeous dress and I highly recommend it. My daughter loves it!!


Had to order a larger size but it fits  great.


I was a little hesitant to purchase this dress online - I'm a big girl at 5'10 270lbs. I ordered the XXXL and crossed my fingers. It arrived today and I'm SO thrilled. It's flattering, high quality material and very comfortable.


Short waisted, makes your boobs look bigger. Beautiful dress


Dress is very cute.. Fits well however itâ€™s a little big in the waist... but you canâ€™t even tell because of the A line form. Iâ€™m a double d so bust wise itâ€™s perfect...especially because the material has a little stretch.


This is a really nice dress. The material is thick (I didn't need to wear a slip - which is good because I couldn't find one that was the right length) and I got a lot of compliments on the dress - which is amazing because I'm overweight. Well worth the money. By the way, it has a zipper but I didn't discover this until I took it off. It has enough stretch that I slipped it on over my head.
