EXCELLENT!!! WOULD BUY AGAIN AT THIS SELLERS!!!


Excellent value for the price.  Quality and fits well.  I normally wear a size 8-10 and the Medium fit me.


Beautiful dress well made!  I had to order the black after seeing the Royal Blue.  Great job Amazon


Absolutely love it I'm a size 8-10 in dresses order a medium due to the strechy like material I could have gotten a small. Looks exactly as pictured.


Great dress, especially for the price. The fit is just slightly big around the waist but it's not noticeable. The fabric is nice and thick (no worries about it being see-through). Would definitely buy again.


Fits great. I ordered 1 size over what I wear and it fits to a t.


Love it!!!


Love this color love the fit love how it feels...It was pretty wrinkled so I let it hang Ill have to iron it before I wear it to the wedding...But it is really nice fabric and its made very nice


THE BOTTOM PART OF THE SKIRT IS KIND OF POUFFIER THAN I EXPECTED. BUT THE REST OF THE DRESS IS PERFECT.


Love the dress.. onot complaint was it came terribly wrinkled and had to take to dry cleaners to press before it could be worn....didn't work with home iron. So add 8 to the cost for pressing
