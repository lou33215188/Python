Great dress. Lived up to all of the reviews. My dress had a minor issue with the zipper being stuck under some of the lace which caused some loose stitching in the back. Other than that completely satisfied and can't wait to get the next one.


Poor quality


Very beautiful dress. Although I haven't worn it out yet and only tried it on, it is beautiful! Very nice color. Love the tea length of it and the lace adds elegance.


BEAUTIFUL Dress!!! Will need to steam the creases out of the skirt once it is delivered but it's a great quality especially for the price. Can't wait to wear it!


Beautiful dress and it fits fantastically. The only flaw I could see was that there were a few lace "clumps" just hanging off the front. Cut them off and it's perfect.


Good style but Too heavy and long skirt to me.


Stays true to size. Good material for the price. I am chubby, but this is a slimming style.


The dress is beautiful! The lace part is stretchy and the skirt is full and feminine. Highly recommend!


The dress more or less fit, but was baggy in the wrong areas... The under arm areas was baggy. So it looked like flying squirrel flaps.


I returned it.


Cute style but fabric is heavy.
