Love it!!!!ğŸ˜�


The dress is beautiful and seems quality, but I measured myself and used the sizing chart they suggested which had me order a larger size than normal. When I got it the dress was too big. Luckily, the return was very simple and I got a smaller dress that I love!


Wanted to love this dress. The top was very nice. The bottom was terrible. Made me look at lot larger then I am


way too small


Great


Gorgeous dress but does wrinkle easily...


Great dress!


Loved this dress. Fit and quality are excellent. It's definitely a party dress, seemed a bit too dressy for work.


I love the dress it is too cute and fit perfect looks even better than pic I was so confused about the size because same people says that it is running small so I chose one size bigger than my original size and it fit really porfect. I am size medium and got size large.


I bought this dress as a back up for a wedding because I wasn't happy with my first choice.  I loved this dress- it was so inexpensive I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.  I got several compliments on it, and was so comfortable all through the day, and dancing into the night.
