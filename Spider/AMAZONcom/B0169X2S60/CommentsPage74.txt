Dress arrived quickly and in great shape. It is well made of nice substantial fabric. I bought it for my daughter, who is 5'8", and the skirt came to her knees, which is hard to find in a size small enough to fit her waist (we bought a small). I would buy a dress from this company again.


if you have a larger bust line go up one size from what you normally would order. Material feels great and very flattering shape and color.


I eas skeptical about purchasing this dress. I was looking for my graduation dress and it was everything I was looking for. Once I received it, it exceeded my expectations, the material is great quality. I am 5'1 and it was a little below the knee but it fitted perfect the normal size I would wear.


It would be tons better, if there were side pockets in dress,, easy to do ?!?!?


Great item


Fabric is not silky or soft. It's a stiff synthetic that wrinkles very easily.


You will not believe how nice this dress is for the price.  Really complements the figure.  Got a million complements.  Even if you only wear it once (but you will wear it again), it's worth it.


Absolutely stunning!! It fits me beautifully, giving me a nice silhouette. It also makes me look thinner, which is a plus :) I have received MANY compliments. One of the best dresses I have ever owned!


perfect dress! i loved it because it was classy yet cute and fit me perfectly. i got the same size i would get in any other store and it was perfect.


This dress was pretty and I loved the color, but it was also too small. Again, I used the chart provided as a guide to choose my size.
