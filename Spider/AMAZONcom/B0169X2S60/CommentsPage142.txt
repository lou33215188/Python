Nice dress!


Gorgeous dress-very comfortable and flattering, too. Very quick ship time made for a great night out. Thanks!


I think the dress is beautiful, but the small was more of a large for me. I kept it so that I could have it taken in.


Great fabric. Feels a little heavy but i looks great with a belt. Nice for many occations. Its very breezy.


Very odd material and heavy dress but I do like it.  It is difficult to get on so I reordered the next size larger hoping it will be easier to get on.  It is very stretchy.


Ordered in navy blue, size L. Very nice fabric, just enough stretch. Lace is very pretty but not delicate. Prefect dress for curvy figure.


I am 5'4 and 150lbs. I purchased the large a d it fit perfectly! The material is nice and the fit is very flattering! Good dress for the price!


LOOOVE this dress! Fit is true to size!


I loved this dress. I wore it to my cousin's wedding and I got so many compliments..I will continue to order from this company and recommend this product. The only flaw was make sure you have time to steam or press the dress


didn't like the material
