The dress was beautiful I loved it . Had to do a little extra ironing but it was beautiful when finished . Very pretty lace lots of compliments on Sunday . Great buy .


This is such a beautiful dress!  Flattering, classy and most of all it' s comfortable! My waist looks tiny!


Received many compliments while wearing this dress. There is a decent amount of stretch in the fabric. I had to return my initial purchase for a smaller size. (215lbs, 5'10" ... And an XL was perfect for me, as I don't like tight clothes.)


Great product. It was very nice. Thank you


There is a rip in the seams of the dress upon arrival.


Dress is cute, but a bit longer in length than expected.


Perfect size and perfect dress! I love the fit on it!


Beautiful dress that is priced to buy would recommend this site. .... wore this to a Christmas Eve party and received complements from everyone.


VERY Poor quality Fit and packing !!!!

I just wore this dress to a wedding and I got loads of compliments. I love the dress and I love the price!


This dress is fantastic and it's also really comfortable.  It's very flattering.  I'm 5'8 and 135 and a medium was perfect.
