I love the all of the material is stretch...even the lace!


My wife loves this one


I love this dress! The material was better quality than I expected, and I thought it looked even cuter in person. I ordered a size small, I'm 5'8, 120 lbs, and it fit well. Skirt ends just at the knees.


This dress is very comfortable and fits well. I loved it.


Is such a beautiful dress, very flattering, well done and with good material. Although it came with a defect in the zipper, but not counting that, it is a great purchase.


I love it!


This dress is even prettier than I expected. The size small fit perfectly and the stretch of the fabric makes it so comfortable.


Fit perfectly,  as expected!


luckily I bought a size larger but it was still tight but could wear it.. buy at least 2 sizes bigger....


Perfect fit. Beautiful dress. Arrived quickly and is exactly as pictured.
