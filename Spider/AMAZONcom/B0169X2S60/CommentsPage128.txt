Very beautiful and flattering. I ordered a size up (Large where I usually wear Medium) but I think medium would've fit great as well. I'm more of a size 10 although depending on the outfit I sometimes get 12


It feels so good and it stretches!


It looks great on me! True to size... :) I feel amazing in this dress.. Yes.. Thanks!


My mom loves this dress! She is wearing it to my wedding in Ireland in a few weeks. I ordered both the L and XL, so she could decide on which one fit best. Her words, "The material is stretchy & feels nice!" She kept the L. My mom is 5'8" 155lbs with measurements: 15" across shoulder 39" bust 30.75" high waist 33" belly button.


Not the best lighting for pics. I'll update post with wedding photo in April.


Poor quality for the price and not flattering.


Absolutely love the dress. The cut, fabric and fitting is just perfect. Really great quality for an awesome price. Happy with my purchase.


the quality and look is perfect. I am a believer of Amazon clothing


This fits so well!  I love how it makes me look thin and I'm a size 14.


top needs to be a bit bigger


This is such a classic dress. I absolutely love it! I was very impressed by the quality of material, especially for the price. The fit is great and the style is timeless. I received many compliments on this dress!
