This is a beautiful dress, I got the Navy Blue and absolutely love it. The only complaint that I have is that the top (bust area) is a little tight. I typically buy my clothes a size large but bought this dress in an extra large and I'm glad I did


Such a lovely dress! One of my new favorites! Needs to be pressed though.


I love the dress it fit just like it was made for me and without any alterations.


I also loved the he fact that just like the good old days it was below the knee.


It looks really nice. The fabric is streachy and fits perfectly. It was for my mother and she love it. It's easy to iron. It is a very fancy dress.


I bought this for my wife to surprise her for date night. Showed up to her work with this dress, her flats, and her makeup. She was blown away and absolutely loved the dress. She wears it to work every now and then and gets a lot of compliments for it.


Fit well  Looks higher quality than one would think.  Wore it to a special event  Got compliments.  I'd recommend.


Beautiful


Looked best with a crinoline to fluff out the skirt.  Unfortunately the zipper broke on the first wearing.  SIGH.


I like it but It gets wrinkled easily. The dress looks nice but is more for the older crowd. I'm a old soul but this dress makes me feel 30 and I am 18. One of my other reasons for buying the dress is because it had a very modest look. the top part is my favorite part.


This dress is so beautiful. I just received this dress today and it truly exceeded my expectations. I typically wear a size 14, so I ordered an X-large and it fit perfectly. The material is somewhat stretchy and is very comfortable. I only wish they offered this dress in more colors. Other then that, it's perfect.
