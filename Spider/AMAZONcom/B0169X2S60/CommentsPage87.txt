Cheaply made. I hated it from the start that I didn't even bother.


Awesome dress for the price. It is slimming for the figure.


beautiful though too long but its ok


My wife really loves this dress! She said the size of dress felt like it was tailored for her, and that it was very comfortable to wear. The style is elegant but versatile, and the quality of fabric is excellent for the price. Thanks for a quality product!


Wrinkles very hard to get out and keep out. Fits a bit large on me.


The material was very thick and nice ğŸ‘�The dress appeared to be very nice for a formal affair. It ran much bigger than I expected. Wish I would have bought the right size.


Absolutely lovely! Perfect blue vintage dress. Can't wait to wear this dress for graduation.


The material felt cheap.  It's like a vinyl material (felt like a windbreaker).  It was not flattering at all and I returned it.


I do like this stylish dress very much.  Had to take it to have it altered at waist.  Other than that, it looks really cute when you wear it.


Even pretty in person. Quality was definitely much better than expected for the price.
