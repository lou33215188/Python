The skirt is a bit wrinkled from packaging but simple to steam iron out. Fits nicely and is my new favorite dress. I love it! I'm a bit color blind so the navy blue does look black but that's OK I love the dress


I was worried ordering a dress online, so I was so relieved to receive this dress.  It seems well sewn with a solid zipper and good fit. The materials don't feel flimsy or plastic-y at all. I'm very pleased with this item!


I received this dress in the mail last week, and I can't tell you how much I'm in love with this dress. The size fit me perfect and the blue looks absolutely beautiful. This dress is a really good quality for the cost. This is my Easter dress so I will post pictures after this weekend.


Good looking dress just ring too small. A friend who is smaller is now enjoying it


Not the biggest fan of the belt. I actually removed it and use a 3 inch wide belt instead. However, the dress fits great!


Very pretty.  Love the color.


I bought this dress as a gift and they loved it. The dress is cheap but it doesn't feel cheap at all. It fit perfect and the lace top area was very classy looking.


Like it, but it doesn't like bid busted person


This dress is exactly what I was looking for! Flattering cut, fabric with a give, and can be as elegant as you want...just coordinate with accessories! Want one in every color now. The Navy was a dark, but still blue...I highly recommend this for everyone.


Great material, good zipper in the back, classy dress. Wore this with a petty coat to fill the skirt. Fit as expected. Comfortable. Great dinner dress!
