Nice dress that I bought for a college graduation ceremony. Good quality for the price, and it came packaged well. If you like to dress modestly, this is a nice option because the skirt part when down to my knees. I'm 5 foot 7 inches and bought a Medium. The dress material is thick enough to wear in cold weather, and I liked the quality of the belt. The skirt portion has a lining, so you don't need to wear a slip if you don't want to wear one. Since the body portion is made of a lace-like stitch, a light-colored bra would show through, but use a black or blue bra/tank top, and it's fine. This dress is a navy blue color, but a very dark navy blue. I'm average sized and found the underarm seam made the shoulder area slightly tight. That is my only complaint though.


Exactly what I expected. Great price and great material for the price!
