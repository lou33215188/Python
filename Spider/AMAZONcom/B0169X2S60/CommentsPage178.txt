Very again


Very pretty dress, fits perfectly.


Did not like the fabric at all.  Wanted too.


Too phoophy (or foofy!) for me. Skirt a little too rigid


This dress fit me perfect and the material is thick too, gotten so many complements


Color and material not quality and it fits too smal


Comfortable fit. Got lots of compliments .


The dress is very pretty and well made.


It was perfect fit. I am very impressed with the quality and the fit.


The Wifey loved it. Fabric is stretchy, which is also nice. Looks absolutely amazing in person, on person, lol.
