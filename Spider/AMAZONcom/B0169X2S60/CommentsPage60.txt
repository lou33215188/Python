Very nice.  The material is a lot thicker than I thought it would be.


This dress is absolutely stunning! Fits as described


I NEVER write reviews- but this dress is so flattering and so comfortable! I'm 5'3, 155lbs and purchased size Medium. It fit perfectly. I'm actually dieting so I ordered it in a small too so I can wear it later as well. At less than $40, why not? The belt hits Just below the last rib, flattering your narrowest area, then flares out above the lower belly. And the lace is stretchy and oh so comfy. I can't wait for the holidays!


Beautiful dress! Very comfortable and fun! Word to the busty girls though, wear a tank underneath or be prepared to let the girls get their time in the spotlight.


Super cute and comfortable dress. Would be easy to dress it up or down.


Beautiful dress you will not regret buying.


Better than I expected! Fits like a glove, wonderful material and cannot wait to iron and wear! I am small and I always encounter things that are too big... not this dress... Perfect!


This a lovely dress.  The color was right on target.  I love material.  I can't wait to wear it so, that I can take a picture and add to my comment.


Great looking dress. Girlfriend loved the look of the dress. When it arrived she tried it on but it felt a little on the small side. This past weekend would have been her first time wearing it but the tiny zipper got stuck and after several minutes of trying to get the zipper unstuck it just broke. So needless to say she never got the chance to wear it.


It's so adorable and modest and perfect! I loved this dress!
