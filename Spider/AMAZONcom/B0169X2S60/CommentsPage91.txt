Super cute!  This fit well.


Dress was wonderful, much higher quality than you'd expect


Wore this dress to a recent wedding - got tons of compliments! Looks nice, well worth the few $$ I spent.


This dress is beautiful. Well made. Nice material. Fits great. Great price. Highly recommended.


Just lovely- classy, but not matronly.


Love this dress. Many compliments. Fits well and is so comfortable. Quite forgiving stretch in the fabric.


This dress is so cute.  I think it would look even better with a petticoat. The dress has a nice weight to it and the material has some stretch to it.  I wear an 8 / Medium and wear a 36B bra.  I purchased a Large, It fits as if it was tailored for me.


I felt super sexy in this dress being plus size and I received several compliments throughout the night. I was extremely please with the product. Only thing was that I usually wear a 2x but I have to go to a 3X to get a proper fit.


This dress really surprised me- great quality & fit, especially for the price. The lace part on top has some great stretch to it, and the skirt is a sturdy fabric that also has a bit of stretch and lays well. Can't wait to wear it!


Looove this dress! I’m typically a size 4-6 and the small had a little room. Very comfortable. One of those dresses where you don’t have to suck in at all yet makes you look super slim. Great winter dress because the skirt is so full.
