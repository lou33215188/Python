Horrible! Fits large, it was permanetly wrinkled, and the stitching was terrible! I was incredibly disappointed! Save your money! This was the worst item I've purchased off amazon.


I LOVE this dress; The quality is grea- just watch to make sure you don't snag the top like I did ....when I  wore it I got so many complements and because I love it so much, I order the other  colorğŸ™‚ Patiently waiting its arrival


Nice dress.


It's a very pretty dress, but the material is a bit stiff and wrinkles very easily.


I will have to return it because it is too small in the bust area.


This dress is beautiful!  It looks and feels like a much more expensive dress.


Adorable and good fit


This dress is wonderful in the picture as well as in person. It has a stretch to it so you have some breathing room. For this price its a steal. It does run a bit small and comes a bit crushed but for the price I'm not complaining.


Perfect.! Have to say my gf loved this dress.


I love this dress material is very stretchy I'm 5'6" 1/2 and 210 curvy I ordered and xl and it fits wonderfully I ordered an XXL at first but sent it bck because it was to spacey
