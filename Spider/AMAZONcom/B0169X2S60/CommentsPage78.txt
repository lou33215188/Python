I got my dress today and I love it. It is a well made dress and very flattering.  Runs true to size.  I ordered Large and it fits perfectly.. The fabric does strech a little.


I did not get the navy blue lace dress. I got a navy blue dress with white neckline and white cuffs. I all so got a checked black and white dress with bow on the neckline. I like both of them but I did want the navy blue lace one. So get back with me and let me know what the mix up was. Thank you.


I wore to a wedding last night and honestly lost track of amazing compliments and women asking were I got the dress. I am 5'3" 190 lbs, 36 DDD and had to go with the XXL because the XL was too tight in the chest. Otherwise I liked the fit of the waist in the XL better.


Love this dress and it can be worn for all seasons.


Love this brand and this dress!! Only thing I don't like is how hard it is to zip because of the zipper. It seems to get stuck every few zips but love this dress! I am a 38 DD and a size 12-14 dress.


It's ok, the fabric is a little hot.  It's good quality but just a little hot.


I kept the dress, but I haven't worn it yet. It feels kind of cheap. I'm sure I'll wear it for Halloween.


Incredibly flattering dress! Thick not too thin. Hangs beautiful. The zipper is a little tough but not too hard. Will buy in blue!


Material was very stiff color is beautiful


tight in the armpits and lower arms (where the strap is) but looks beautiful...
