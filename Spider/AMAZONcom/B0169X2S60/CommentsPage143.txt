Great dress... The medium navy fit perfectly with my 5'2" 145 lbs frame.  The material is stretchy and skirt is very thick material.

Business like, sexy


I originally ordered an XXL based on a review that someone similar in height/weight submitted. That one ended up being too big on me, so I returned it, free of charge (just had to print the UPS label and drop it off), and ordered the XL. I am 5'7" and approximately 200 pounds and the XL fits great! I was worried about the sleeves fitting too tightly, as that is usually my biggest issue, but that wasn't the case. The dress as a whole is made of heavier material (except the lace part, of course) that feels like it will last a long time. I love how "tight" the lace is woven because I can wear a nude colored bra and you can't even see them unless you know they're there. I also was very happy with the built in camisole. No need to worry about finding one that matches the color. Overall, this dress is beautiful! I wish they offered it in more colors though. Especially if they had a slightly lighter colored blue, that would be amazing. I don't think there is anything negative I can say about this dress. I love it and I can't wait to wear it!
