In Love!!! 3x size 18-20 fits snug on large chested frame but looks amazing. I recommend a tutu for underneath to make it puff out ğŸ˜� DID SOMEONE SAY ADELE!?!?


Beautiful dress!! ğŸ˜�


This dress is a beautiful dress. I love it.


Believe the reviews! Great quality dress that has a little stretch for us bigger girls. I received a ton of compliments on it. Highly recommend.


This dress is amazing, way cuter than you can see in the pics!


I love this dress! I used the size/measurement guide to get the right size. Worked perfectly. I received so many compliments when I wore it. My new fav dress!


Lovely dress. I need to get it alter. Make sure you check out the size chart.


Love the dress but it runs vey small and is short waisted.. I ordered a XXL when I normally ware a XL. I did reorder a larger size (XXXL) because I did like the dress. I now need to send the first dress back. Please advise me as to how I do this


Thank you


I read all the reviews before I bought, and holy cow! the reviews were right!  This dress is fantastic, it fits so well and is so fun and elegant!


Normally a size 8 in dresses and a medium fit wonderfully. Very nice detailing with hidden buttons and seams were well stitched.
