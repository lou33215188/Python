I bought this dress for my bf and I's anniversary. Usually I'm really skeptical of buying clothes online because usually things don't fit right. However this fit perfect. This was more than I expected! :)


The color of this dress came out dark blue instead of what shows on amazon website.  Disappointed.


It was wonderful


Love this dress!


It fits perfectly, the lace has the perfect amount of give and I am a slightly bigger girl so I got the 3X and it still fits perfect!


Read dozens of reviews and ordered according to size guide.  Still too small (and I'm not huge).  Too much hassle to return.


I just received dress today it came very fast only waited a day the size was great I am a medium an I ordered same an I was very nervous due to some weight I gained this month an because ordering cloths I can't try first can obviously be difficult an scary but I read other reviews n comments and they said the material had some room for give an they are right the dress fit perfect! I am 5'8 150-160lbs an the med was great fit an fit just right, if I did large it would of been way too big. The material was great not made with some cheap fall apart stuff I was very shocked and pleased. I would most def recommend this dress. The night i wear it I will take a pic I no seeing pics really helped me to pick it out so I can see what it actually looks like on a normal person not a model let's face it we don't all look like them so seeing the pics and reading comments really make a diff on what I decide.


This is a BEAUTIFUL, classy and great quality dress, the bright blue color is amazing, I got SO many compliments... very pleased!


Oh my, this was the worst dress ever. Poor quality material. No zip connecting bodies and skirt. A struggle to get it on! Don't buy this dress.


This dress exceeded my expectations. It was well made and fit very nicely. i would order from this company again.
