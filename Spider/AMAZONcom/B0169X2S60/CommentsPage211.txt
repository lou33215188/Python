Well we ordered the dress and needed it like 3 days later and it came on the day we needed it and it was not the right dress it was cute and fit but we had no time to get it fixed so we wore it I just wanted to make the review letting people no


Fits great


love it!!


The dress is sooo cute I'm 5'5 162 and a C and the button along the bossom area gapes a little...otherwise stretchy comfy fit everywhere else. I ordered a medium based on reviews


I wish it came in garment bag, folded in plastic was a bitch to iron


Fits my wife just right she loves it


It's nice,  I was disappointed it came in the wrong color though.  I picked royal blue and got black.


Quality product


I was expecting a better product based on reviews but it was plain looking


Unbelievable quality and perfect fit.  Absolutely beautiful dress and made as well as any designer brand you could buy.  I wish they had more colors!
