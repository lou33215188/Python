Beautiful dress!  Awesome deal and great quality!  I was hesitant at first but  pleasantly surprised when it was delivered.


When I first got this dress I was disappointed, it's so thick and the fabric reminded me of curtain material. But I tried it on and was surprised how well it fit and although it's warm it's comfortable. Plus, I received lots of compliments.


Love it...perfect fit


Tried it on it fit perfect hopefully it still fits in July for the wedding I'm wearing it too. Guess I better lay off the hot fudge sundaes.


this is a really good quality dress! I'm really excited to wear it in the Fall! the blue is really more of an almost black (I wouldn't call it navy either) but it's beautiful to say the least!


I love the dress, is more than I petted.  I am 5.2 height 145 lbs, ordered a medium and if fits perfect.


My 13 year old, thin and not a lot of curves yet, wanted this dress for her birthday.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fabric and workmanship.  It fits beautifly on her.  I'm not sure this would work as well for a very curvy or full figure woman.  I purchased a small for her.


Excellent


I was a little uneasy about ordering clothes online because of not fitting right.  Past experience your size isn't the size of what you order. But the dress fits perfect even around arms.


Love how it looks on. It is very well made and the fabric streches. Everything about it says quality.
