Fits great


Unfortunately will be be returning.  Disappointed after reading so many wonderful reviews.  Was hoping to wear the dresses on my upcoming cruise however, colors VERY BRIGHT and material too thick, and not as I expected.  Looks more like a costume than a dress I would wear on a cruise!


I'm 5'3 and curvy and this dress definitely shows your curves. Although it is a little long but nothing that a little alteration can't fix. Overall I really love the dress


love the dress . its just like the picture and true to size


Beautiful dress , arrived on time and it fit perfect! I ordered a size Large I believe
