Perfect fit,  Love it!!


Bought for my baby shower and wore 7 months pregnant and loved. I'll be able to wear when I'm not pregnant as well so it's nice to have both options:)


I ordered about 5 dresses in this style and IMO, is by far the prettiest one. I am 5'5", 150. My measurements are: 40", 32", 41 1/2". As you can see I have a butt and hips but was still able to fit into a MEDIUM. The length was perfect.


This dress right here!!!! I have big breast and am a size 14 so I ordered XL. This dress is so versitile. You can wear both sleeves up...looks fabulous, one sleeve up one down...looks fabulous, both sleeves down...looks fabulous! Great material and very forgiving. Loved it so much turned around and ordered 2 other prints! Ladies if you got a man bring him with you when you wear this one ;)


While obviously not for me, this dress fit my granddaughter perfectly and was a hit for her Hawaiian themed school choral festival. The two-day shipping was "right on" and gave her the chance to finalize her style right up to the last minute. Excellent quality and perfect workmanship. Thanks.


I absolutely like this dress. It fits better than I expected. With me being so tall I honestly wasn't expecting it to be as long as it was. I just knew it was but I ordered it anyway. Well, I am 5'10 and 124lbs and it hit the floor. I wore 3 inch heals with it and you couldn't see them. I received sooooo many compliments on this dress. I will definitely be ordering this dress in a different print.


I love the dress but it ran a bit large. I am very hippy and normally wear a large but I ordered a medium because I have a dress like this that is too big. Well, the medium is still too big. I really like the dress so I am planning on keeping it. It also runs very long so keep that in mind it you are short. I am 5'9" and it was too long for me. Nice thick BodyCon knit and it is not see through. Couldn't figure out why there was a zipper up the side because there was plenty of room to pull the dress all the way up. Other than those few things, YES, I would recommend this dress.


First of all let me start by saying thanks to this company,  cus this gown rock.  I was a bit skeptical about the material of this gown but I decided  to take the risk and guess what it blow my mind. I'm 5.6fit tall, 145 weight, Burst,  36, waist, 28, hips 45. And I decided to order a small cus for some reason I always like my dress to hug my hips. And guess what it did just as expected cus the material is stretchy. And let me say,the first day I got it decided to wear it to the movies, as soon as I stepped out starting from my door to the car, I received a lot of complements. Many were asking me where I got my gown , I gave them the website.  Hope this review helpful to someone.


Amazing! Material and fit are great! Sometimes it is hard to find off-the-shoulder items that actually stay off the shoulder without being annoying or fussy  and this definitely feels like it is going to stay right where you place it! I experimented with an off-the-shoulder one shoulder and completely around my bust as a tube top.  It felt comfortable and looks good each way.


I am 5'9 172 lbs and the large fit great.  Can be done with heels or flats.  I have never left a review before that is how much and I love this dress! I definitely will be buying more.


I absolutely love this dress ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�
