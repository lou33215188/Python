I LOVE this dress.  It's so flattering, I wish I had more places to wear it.


The dressed looked just like the photo but it was EXTREMELY TOO LONG! I ordered a medium and the length was outrageously too long. I have to take it to the cleaners to removed a few inches in order for it to fit me length wise. I'm 5'5".


Pretty,  it ran small and hated the fabric!


This dress is gorgeous like I'm in love. I'm 5'5" with 36DDD and it fit perfectly. I ordered another and will update with a picture when I do a review for the other dress


Amazing dress


Good price


Fits perfect


I love it!!!


I will be returning this item.  The dress is lovely but it just doesn't fit right.  I normally take a Medium and I'm not a big person but it just looked awful on me.  It was too tight around the waist and too big on top.


GREAT material, a lot of stretch, excellent fit


Absolutely stunning and dramatic dress.  Comfortable, yet durable material and not flimsy fabric.  Dress was a bit long.  I’m 5’5” 135 lbs and ordered a small.  It fit well despite being a bit long but I wore sandals with it and just gathered the bottom in my hand when walking.  I plan on buying more in other colors.  Boyfriend loved it on me.


Love this dress. Fits great and is very pretty on. The material is a little thin you will need some black spanx or similar underneath.


Nice
