Perfect length, so so pretty! Wore it on my honeymoon and received tons of compliments!


This dress is a hit.


Im a size 10-12, 5'5 and 176lbs.


A must have.


Clothes can be a huge hit or miss on here - somethings that look amazing are paper thin and horrible looking - so I get a bit nervous- this is a good solid material - stretchy- colors are true and sizing is true- I am tall 5'10' and this touches the ground with out shoes on- so if you are not as tall be prepared to have it hemmed


This a beautiful dress.  I love it.  Fits like a glove.  Vibrant colors.  So many colors, you could pretty much wear any color shoes/accessories with it.  MUST BUY.


Absolutely beautiful, my boyfriend loved it, I loved it and I got plenty of compliments


So many compliments off my dress love it!!!


I ordered a size medium. Its pretty long very stretchy material!! Love it! No complaints! My size is 5'5 150 lbs in case your wondering.


Went to a tiki themed party and received many compliments. Can't believe it fit perfectly!


I'm 5'5 160lbs athletic curvy... The dress was a silky polyester type of material and it didn't fit well.


This dress is beautiful and I feel so sexy in it! Must buy!


Didn't like fabric, very cheap and i was very disappointed that i had to pay $6.00 to return the dress .... will not buy any products with this company
