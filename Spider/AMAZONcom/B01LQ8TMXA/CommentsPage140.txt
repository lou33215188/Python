I love the fit and excited to wear it on my trip to the islands.


Too small


Prettiest dress I own. Fits true to size and the colors are just so beautiful!  Glad I bought it and not see through


I'm 5'3ft, 140lbs,  so it's a bit long. The fit is perfect. I usually wear medium but i ordered a size (S).


Beautiful dress, sizing is way off. I even followed the size chart.


I love this dress great quality?


It a little large in the stomach area. Cute dress


Amazing fit!!!  Already had my mom buy 2! Perfect for Hawaii!!!


Very nice! Planning on ordering 2 more dresses


Beautiful dress, fit great.
