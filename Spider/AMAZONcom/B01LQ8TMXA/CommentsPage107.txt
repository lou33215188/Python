Loved it. 5â€™7 156 lbs bought the medium.


This fabric shows all stomach imperfections. Maybe had I got a larger size this would have looked better. The fabric is a nice stretchy.


Loved the dress, but thought it was a bit too tight!


I would love to return fir smaller size. Dress way too big but I don't see how to do that.


I would be more comfortable in a 2x if there was such a size. It is well made and I was able to get into. The material is pleasingly durable and not taking a way from the style!


I got a medium just my size.  Lots of great compliments.


Better constructed than expected! would buy again!


Nice material


Nice, but the quality was off, I'll probably wear it to the beach.


This is a beautiful dress, the fit is perfect for me and the top portion has an elastic fit so it doesn't slip down. I love it.
