Maybe this style isn't for me, but the dress did not look like the picture when I put it on. The off shoulder ruffle was very poofy and did not look right. It also runs a little small, so get the size up.


Nice material


This dress is so beautiful and the colors are gorgeous. Cannot wait to wear on my honeymoon. I am 5'5 and 127lbs and got size small. Fits perfectly and length is great. Like it besy worn as one shoulder. Great dress very happy with purchase.

The fabric is good. The print is nice but it is very very long and the ruffles are just huge. Had to return unfortunately.


Super cute but too small. I ordered the size I wear but will have to return it and order the next size up and try again. 4 stars because it is very pretty and cute, just too small.
