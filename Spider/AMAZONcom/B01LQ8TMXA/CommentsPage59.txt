Great dress very sexy it totally complimented my mom's figure (although it kinda warm for the summer)


I was worried about ordering this dress, thinking it may look cheap in person, but I am glad I did. I wore it in Barbados and received a lot of compliments.


A little more fitted than I thought, but very pretty and nice quality


This dress is perfect thich quality material and very sexy can't wait to wear this.. Love it!!


Very long I have to wear 4 inches high heels to get away with length,  yes unfortunately I'm only 5'3, this dress is for 5'5&up height, fyi. .... tight fitting make sure your stomach is flat!


i am a size 12. i should have stuck with the large but reading the previous i decided to order a size up and it is too big. pretty dress, though


Love this dress. Fits and washes well. Very comfortable and received many complements


Very nice dress, I did think it was going to be cotton however it fits well.  It's also very long and for a tall girl, 5'9 that's a good thing.


This is the best dress ever!!!! Colors are vibrant , fits perfect! Wow this is amazing !!!!! No regrets !!!!!


Got as expected
