Short! For someone who is 6feet


Fits a little big and long. My advice is to go down a size and for length just gather around waist. Colors are vibrant. Good purchase


I just received this dress...its amazing hugs every curve... I'm 200lbs and have 38ddd bra size, XL fits just fine...:-))))


I will be buying more!


Love love love if I could get in in every color I would !


Absolutely love this dress. I bought a large because I don't like my clothes super tight. It fits really well.


The cover up fits true to size but the swim suit that goes underneath fits like Asian sizes, extremely small and poor quality


I would say order a size smaller than normal.  It is loose and does nothing for my figure.. too boxy up top.


Great dress material was really nice


Love this! Form fitting but very flattering! I'm 5'8" and 195 lbs. mostly curves and hips.... looks great! I'm buying another color


Very pretty, I love the dress, I  would definitely order it again. I am super stoked and cannot wait to wear it. In addition to this, The dress came in 2 days...YAY
