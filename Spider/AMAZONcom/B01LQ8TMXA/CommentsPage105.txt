Love, love, love this dress!!  I don't normally buy clothes on Amazon but the quality of this dress has changed my mind!! I received so many compliments.  Quality is excellent!!


The dress fits as expected.  However, the elastic shows at the top and cannot be hidden.  I sent it back.


I Absoluetly love the fit!! I ordered XL I'm 40dd breast weight 190 !! If this helps


Love. Will purchase from this company again.


The fit is amazing got a lot of compliments!!!


its an adorable spring dress.  im in my second trimester so its a little snug on my belly but i know it'll be just as cute post baby


I LOVE IT! IT FITS EVERY CURVE ON MY BODY. THE PATTERN DESIGN IS BEAUTIFUL AND THE STYLE IS SEXY. I'M PLANNING TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE IN A DIFFERENT DESIGN.


Beautiful dress-runs big but no big deal. Would give it 5 stars except it arrived ripped! And because it's about 9inches, unfortunately it's not fixable!!! Very upset!


Great dress


I absolutely love this gorgeous dress!! I bought this for my work trip to Jamaica and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived!! It fit perfectly.
