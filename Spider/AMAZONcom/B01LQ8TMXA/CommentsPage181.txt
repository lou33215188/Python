i would have loved this but it runs big. very pretty dress and can be worn on or off shoulder.i am size 4 and got the small  but it was loose. will have to take it in.other then that its a lovely summer dress!!


Love this dress! I needed something for a luau in Hawaii in a few weeks, this fits perfect, I can't wait to wear It!


Wore it to a Hawaiian themed party and it fit well. I am 5'9" and the length was perfect!


I just got it tried and I was stunned. Amazing dress. I am 5'7" and 150 lbs and purchased medium size and fits amazing . Not too tight very comfy fit. Enchansed curves beautifully. Only i have to cut length  maybe 3 inches. Too long but that is not big deal.


Pattern is exactly as on picture even nicer. Today I am going to buy 2 more in different pattern. Love this dress.


Worth every penny !!!


Great dress! I'm 5'0, 117lbs and pretty petit, and fits well, flattering. It was a tad bit long and had to have it hemmed. But even if I did not hem I could probably get away with wearing it once not hemmed and would have to pull on the dress at times. Washed it and it was fine, did not bleed or shrink, etc. Got complicments from the dressğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼ Also, the shoulder part was perfect! It didnt need adjusting or anything like that when I had it on, and I have an infant that I had to carry all the time, so the dress survived! Great dress!


Gorgeous dress. Very flattering, I got an extra large and could have gone with a large. For reference I am 5'1 and about 200lbs. 38 E cup, very happy with how it complimented my shape and natural curves.


I have this dress in 2 color patterns and i LOVE it! Comfy and fits perfect!


Beautiful dress, great length. Im 5'5 and it goes to the floor. It is made of a stretchy swimsuit like material, but it drapes nicely. The colors are bright too!


I'm 5' 61/2" 188lbs  Bust 36DD I ordered the xl to make sure it can accommodate my tushy and extra belly..lol but I usually wear a US size med-lg. I loved it, spanks later!!


I wore it on a Concert date with my hubby...the men were gaga and he enjoyed seeing that!!
