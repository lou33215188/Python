I'm in love with this dress


Cute dress.


This dress looks awesome on me. Better than expected. The material was even good. Can't wait to wear it


Size Chart is inaccurate. Dress looked and felt very cheap. Very poor in quality. Will never order from this Seller again. Totally disappointed.


a little long I am 5ft 1 so I will have to get it himed at the bottom.


This dress is gorgeous.  My husband smiled from ear to ear when I tried it on. I ordered the XL which was a pretry good fit.  I am 5'9 200 LB.


Great fit, nice material, not cheap and not see thru. Just as described.


This is the perfect fit, cant wait to wear it for a wedding and later order more stuff


The best material. Strong, sturdy, flowy. Just amazing. Stretches in the waste. I'm 5'1 and its just right with heels.


Fit perfectly, im 5'5 145 pounds ordered a medium
