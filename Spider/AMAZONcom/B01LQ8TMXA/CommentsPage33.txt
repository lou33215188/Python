my daughter wore this to a backyard luau and once it gets wet, for any reason, it becomes very heavy.  It you are going to wear it to an air conditioned event it will be perfect.  Colors were as brilliant as the picture.


Beautiful! Fits great


I was disappointed in this dress because I ordered an XXL and it was way too tight.  I purchased a similar style in a XL and it fit perfect.  I guess this one was an irregular.


Shows every dimple and I mean EVERY ONE. Good quality and floor length and more I'm 5'9 so that's hard to find. Will require something to hide my stretchmarks from showing thru.


Great fit, I’m short and I needed to get it hemmed which ended up costing more than the dress itself. I’ve only worn it once and I can’t wait to wear it again! I highly recommend. 5 stars if it were a bit shorter


This dress is beautiful. Good quality material. ColorS are vivid. It hugs my body like it's made just for me.


I normally wear a size M or 10 in dresses...but because I have wide hips ..a large rear and the dress was fitted I thought I'd get a L in this.


I could have done a M but I still like the L on.


Think I'm going to get another one in a M.


Love this dress!


I could've got away with a medium since it does stretch but either way the large fit not to tight and everyone loved it. Heavy material and long which im not complaining


Beautiful dress. I love it. It fix my body very well the material is good. I ordered XL which is my regular size and it fixes me so nicely. Recommended, the color is like in the picture.


So, I’ve gained some weight in my tummy so I look a little preggers, but I’m keeping the dress bc it’s so pretty and I plan to lose the weight


perfect fit
