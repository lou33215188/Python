Better than expected, good quality and not see through. Very pretty!


5 1 180 ordered a med  fits great!!


Love the fabric but the sem running down the middle of the dress ruins the look for me. Would have preferred just 2 side seams.


I'm 7 months pregnant and ordered this for a wedding I'm attending and it fits great! I was nervous to order a Large but it's nice material, stretchy (but not thin and crappy) and looks great!


Beautiful well made well fitted dress


Love it


Beautiful dress. Hugged my curves in all the right places.


This dress is very sexy!! I get so many compliments every time I wear it! I did have to have it altered in length. it was way to long, but I'm only 5'2.


Its nice and long enough for us tall girls (5'11)  I wore it for a childs birthday party, the only downfall is that I had to keep pulling it down


This dress is amazing!!! Hugs your curves so perfectly and the color is stunning ! Absolutely recommend ğŸ˜�
