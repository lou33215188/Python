Perfect dress


It was cute but I didnâ€™t care for the print so I returned it. HOWEVER, Omarosa does wear it on Celebrity Big Brother, so I guess she likes it fine.


Looks so good on


I'm a large and that's what I ordered, but I could have gone with a medium. It's super stretchy, which I like, so it gives me a little "ruching". It's also pretty long. I'm 5'6" and it just about touches the ground. Great to wear with wedges!


Ordered an xl according to size chart but it was too big. Didn't like the off the shoulder ruffles on me. Returned


I love this dress, it fit my body perfectly and the material was considerably better than i thought it was going to be. I gave 4 stars because it is quite long and i won't be wearing ut with heels.


No regrets in buying this dress. I love it.


I am usually a size 10. I'm 5'9 and 170lbs and 36D. I ordered both a medium and large.  I like the way both fit. Obviously the medium hugs my body but in a good way. The large has a looser fit but still compliments.


Cute dress for a tall person.  Way to long for me 5' 2".


Love the print....fabric is okay,
