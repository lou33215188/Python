I'm 5"4" 162 lbs and got a small (it's tight) in white with flowers I possibly could have gotten a MED if i wanted it loose,I truly like it!! For the price no complaints ......


Recieved many compliments. Just order a size less than what you wear because the material stretches.


Very pretty dress! I love it.


only too long but will be fixed


Absolutely gorgeous!!! A little thicker fabric but fit like a glove and my figure looks beautiful in this dress!!! Love love love it!


I am a size 14 and ordered and XL and could not even get this dress over my shoulders.. who did they make this dress for.. Barbie? The dress is pretty.. the material is nice.. if are a size 8-10 order an xl... I am very disappointed.


I bought this dress for a luau themed party and I got so many compliments that night. Iâ€™m pretty curvy and it hugged me and all the right places. You can either wear this dress with shoulders or off the shoulders. Both ways are super cute. Would buy again


This pattern hides it all.


I loved it my boyfriend hates it. I were a 2x and ordered an 2x. It fits as expected.


This is a gorgeous dress fits a little to snug for me so I rebought in the next size up this dress is to cute to pass up also bought another print as well
