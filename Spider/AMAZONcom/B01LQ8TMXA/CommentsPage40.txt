Ordered a large and it seemed like a medium. Way too snug. I went off the reviews and what others said they ordered by weight etc. The dress itself had no size label on it  or even a label sewn in so i have no idea how they figure the size to ship it but the package it came in had a sticker. Even if it did fit, the material felt rough and I didn't like how thick it was. Not good for summer.  Returned it and found something way nicer.
