GREAT PRODUCT


I am a tall person this item fit just right love it


Good quality, came just in time and was so cute once i tried it on.


Has a horrible smell even after a good wash. So much so that I can't even wear. Too bad as was looking forward to wearing as is cute. Waste of money for me!


Nice to finally get a dress that's cute, fun and sexy. I'm pretty shapely but a M works fine for my size 50in hips


love the dress perfect fit. no adjustments needed. very good quality material.


Wore this dress on a cruise I loved it


I like this dress. I'm going to Cuba next month and needed something like this. It fits great. I gotta lose a little belly before I actually wear it out in public. But no complaints.


I bought it for my holiday, it's so nice


Itâ€™s ok the fabric lighting up around my chest area
