Beautiful dress.  Exactly as pictured, but too long.  Order a size up if you don't want a form fitting dress.


Fit very well, flattering even for fuller figures like mine. I wore to a beach wedding and was perfect. The pattern was gorgeous and the cut perfect for the occasion. Husband loved it and got compliments. Best of all-I felt great in it!


I love this dress although I had to return it. It's perfect for a wedding reception. I got x-large and im 5'7" 200 lbs, the dress was a perfect fit! Its very soft and stretchy and hugs your body comfortably.


This dress looks absolutely stunning. I ordered the medium and my measurements are 36, 29, 42, and it fit so nice. The material is thick, and not see through at all. So beautiful. Will be ordering other colors


The material was good but not for hot summers because it does not breathe and you will be hot in it. But the design and fit was good. Recommend ordering one size up from your regular size for a decent fit.


I love this dress! I'm 5'8" 170 pounds and ordered a large. It's stretchy,comfortable and I feel sexy in it. Lots of heads turn when I wear it.


I would give more than 5 stars if I could. I loved everything about this dress. I love the print, the fit, the length....fabulous dress. I also got the African print one. Gorgeous!!


i returned it because i did not like me in it, but it is a beautiful dress.  Nice material, designed for the hour glass girl.


This dress is versatile and you will feel like you have your nightgown on.  not too thin just right.  off the shoulder, one shoulder or up on both shoulders!  u will love it!


I loved this dress ğŸ˜�ğŸ¤— I am 5 foot 4 and I weigh 200lbs. I ordered a XL. It fits comfortable and the material was not bad at all for the price. I would definitely buy this again!
