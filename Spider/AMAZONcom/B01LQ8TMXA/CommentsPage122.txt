Using as maternity Photoshoot dress, hoping it'll be perfect! I'll post pics once it's done. Fits beautifully, got the right color pattern and size.


nice color, length and true to size


It's a beautiful dress but It was way too tight. I couldn't get it over my head. I should have went up a couple of sizes


Love love love this dress! Material doesn't wrinkle, the length is perfect and the colors are just as pictured.


Very cute and sexy on!


It fits wonderful I absolutely love the color!!!!!


This dress is fire, fire, fire. My husband loves this dress on me.


Pretty nice dress fit good it's just too long so I'll have to wear heels (I'm 5'2) can't wait to wear it on my vacation


This dress is amazing. I'm 5'2 so I will have to get this hemmed but I'll probably get an awesome head wrap out of it. The fabric is stretchy but not cheaply so when you wash it,it won't lose it's cling. I'm a 36b and i fell secure secure enough to go without a bra.


I will buy all there dresses! Didn't want to take it off!!
