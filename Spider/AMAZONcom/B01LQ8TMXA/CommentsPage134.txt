It's a cute dress it's made very small check the size chart I wear a 14/16 I had to order a 5xl


I order an XL and fits more like a Large.. Im 5'7 the length is long touches the floor.


I love the dress. It’s fit perfect. I’m short so it was to long. That’s the only thing


Beautiful, elegant and fit perfectly...just the length, was too long


Love it. Fits and feels great


Material to thick ordered a small and it fit like a large. Not what I expected..


Beautiful dress, great material, great fit, just perfect will buy another one ;)


Better than expected. Really nice material. Not cheap. Definitely buying more form here !!!!!!


Love it!! Fits awesome great material!


fits like a mermaid dress, which I really hate.
