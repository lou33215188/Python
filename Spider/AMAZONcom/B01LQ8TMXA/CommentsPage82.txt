Worked well for my maternity pictures. I ordered a medium, I weigh 133lbs and I was 33 weeks pregnant at the time.


Not flattering for me


Lovely feel


Love it!! I wore it to my sims Luau party and it was perfect! I got a small. I'm 5'6, 120 lbs.


Love it I get so many compliments whenever I wear it beautiful dress.


Pretty


Fits a little snug.  Nice material comfortable overall.


Very beautiful.


Love it


Dress fits really good but unfortunately if you are 5'3, like me,  you are going to have to get it alter.  The dress looks just like the picture.  Can be worn off shoulders or on. I'm going to keep it because it's bold,  just like me.  Radiant dress
