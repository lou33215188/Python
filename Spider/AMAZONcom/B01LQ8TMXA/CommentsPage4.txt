Beautiful dress! I received so many compliments.


I am 5'8" 182# purchased a large and I love the fit.


I wore this dress on my shoulders with a little crop sweater


Love love love this dress


Omg but this....i am a medium in size 155 lbs and I got a large,fits fine, it huge the body.


This dress is super sexy omg.  The fabric hugs your skin so it doesn't hide any belly bulge if you have one so beware of that.  I love this dress, I am 5'8" and my waist is 28" the medium fit me like a glove.


I love it! Hugs my curves well


Absolutely loved this dress..fit as I expected was only sweeping the ground because I am really short but I loved it


This dress is absolutely beautiful! I chose style # 61189-7.  I read lots of reviews to determine my sizing and even though I *could have* bought a Medium or Large ...I instead ordered an XL (I don't let labels get me down! ğŸ˜Œ -- this is Asian sizing so it's a bit smaller and less curvy than US sizing.)


B: 32DDD


W: 31"


H: 41"


Weight: 159 lbs ... athletic build.


Height: 5'7" ... **I'm barefoot in one pic to show the length**


I'm very glad I ordered the XL because I wanted the dress to have a looser fit, not a 'body-con' fit.  I don't like feeling squeezed into my clothes.


The colours are vibrant; it's nice and stretchy fabric and it's rather well put-together for an inexpensive dress -- it even has a side zipper.


There was slight miscommunication with my order initially, but overall, I'm happy with the outcome and I'd shop again from this merchant.  They gave prompt replies to messages and good customer service.  I received it in 1 week from China.  Thanks!


I was very pleased with this purchase. I bought it to wear to my baby shower since we are not finding out the sex of the baby. The material is thick enough so that the dress is not see through, and very soft. I am 5'1" and currently 138lbs, but I am also 5 1/2 months pregnant! Normally I weigh around 125lbs, This dress fits me now since the material is pretty stretchy and I think it will fit me really good even after I have the baby. It is a little bit long, since I am so short, but I was able to pull the dress up a little bit under the top ruffle to make it just drag the floor and you cant even tell any material is scrunched up under the ruffle. The sleeves were a little tight on my arms, but I have slightly muscular arms for my size. It is just the band that is tight, the actual sleeve parts still fits loose. I love this dress and plan on ordering some of the other prints!


I love this dress..i am 5'5 , 150lbs..ans i took a medium..this dress fits perfectly..took a while to come..but absolutely in time for my vacay...not wesring any undergarments/spanx/foundations and it still hugs all curves..i will add more pics wants I'm jazzed up


XL, 38D, 34W, 47 hips


The material is not thin. It's a nice material and it hugs the curves just right. I'm 5'9 and it falls long to the ankles! For the price.. you have a winner!! I'm ordering more!!
