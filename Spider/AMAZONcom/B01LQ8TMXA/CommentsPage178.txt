I love it, perfect fit the color is awesome.  It's a little heavier than I thought it would be.


This dress is perfect!! I'm 5'11" and 180 pounds I ordered a large. It's long enough and that's all I can ask for! Fabric is stretchy and comfortable. The print is clear. Would definitely recommend.


Beautiful dress! Perfect for upcoming summer nights and my trip to Jamaica! I must say I was back and forth between a large and an XL and I'm so happy I got the XL! This dress does run a little small so I would keep that in mind when purchasing! All in all, I'm super happy with my purchase!!!


I am 5feet 6 inches and a general xsmall at 125lbs and I ordered the small as there was no xsmall option and it fit, was a bit long if I'm in flats but its beautifully made, the fabric isn't cheap,  I love it look exactly as in the photo.


I absolutely love the dress. Now my mid area is no 6 pack and its fitting so it showed everything so I did lil inhaling to disguise the poke ğŸ˜‚ But I was wearing this! It is everything! The reviews were very helpful. I'm 5'8.5"ğŸ˜� a few lbs shy of. 200. I ordered an XL. I didn't notice the zipper on the side until a second ago after I searched for a tag. I slipped it right on. It served its purpose.


I absolutely love this dress and so did everyone else.  I got so many compliments and questions on where I purchased it and they were shocked when I said "Amazon"....who knew!  I actually found it cheaper on Amazon from another vendor but when I received it, because I was going to return the other one, the fabric was much thinner and the quality was poor.  I didn't mind paying the extra money for this dress.  It has a good weight to it and it draped my body beautifully!  I am 5'11" and 185 pounds.  I ordered an X- large and it fits perfectly.  The length was perfect as well.  You won't go wrong if you buy this dress.  I wore it on a Girlz trip to Florida and the colors were perfect, bright and colorful.  Really stood out in the pictures we took.  I kept it in it's original package (like a Ziploc bag) and when I put it on a few days later, it was wrinkle free.  WOW!!!  I am going to purchase another one in a different color.


Super cute


I love the color and fit of this dress!  It's perfect for our luau party!  It is well made too!  I am going to order another one!  I am 5 foot 7 - and the length is perfect.


The dress was nice and fit great. The colors and this specific dress was just too bright. Made me look like I was in Hawaii. It was long though which I like I'm 5'8. And it went past my ankles.


Love this dress so beautiful!! 5'7 195 and I ordered a large it's a perfect fit !! Love the length and it's holds on to your curves all day and does not stretch out of shape. I'll be order a few more colors
