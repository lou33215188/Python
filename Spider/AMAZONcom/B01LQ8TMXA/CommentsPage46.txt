I'm 6'2 I normally wear small but I ordered a medium for the length still fits but I like a tight fit so I'll have alterations done. Great dress no lie


Love this dress. It has really nice fabric, a little heavy but very comfortable. The thread came undone at the top. The fit was a little off but I'm very curvy so I took it in at the places that were too big. I am 5'8 200lbs chest 40 waist 32 hips 44 for those that need sizing help.


I so love this dress and can't wait to wear it.  It fits great and the material is Unbelievable. I'm 5'7 152 and it hugs me very well. I'm so excited I'm about to order me another one


Love this dress


I am 5’7” and it is so difficult to find LONG maxi dresses for my height. This dress is not only long enough- but the material feels thick and sturdy. Love this dress and debating what other print to buy next


I love this dress, but should have gotten the size under.


not at all what i expected it fits way too small and i went a size up. if you are curvy and a size 16 you will be disappointed. This did not \go over my hips.


Beautiful dress. You maybe need to get it hemmed if you are shorter than me (5'4'). I needed about 2-3 inches taken off.


Amazing. So good , my mom and sister ended up ordering one ... in my presence lol
