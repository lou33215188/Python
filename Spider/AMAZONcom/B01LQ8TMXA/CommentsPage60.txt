Terrible quality! Felt like a cheap swimsuit and had a very thick seam on the back side. Sent back


It is a beautiful dress I wear a size 10-12 and I ordered a large it was a little small, but cute.


Beautiful dress! Well made and great material.


I love this dress. The material is not so thin that you can see right through it and the fit is great.  It's very body con, and you can wear it with the sleeves up or down without it looking weird.  I couldn't get a picture far enough away, but it's nicely made for such a great price. I may buy another one  in a different color. Packaging was great he came in the nice recyclable plastic bag that wasn't thin. ❤️


Beautiful dress im so happy with my purchase! Ordered my usual size Medium and it fit perfectly. I love the length, goes right up to my heels, excellent!


Pretty but didn’t fit so I returned it


Lots of compliments! Love the fit and feel!


was too big and did not like how the material felt, i returned it.


Bought this for my aunt and she loves it alot....buy one size down


I’m 5”3 and I weigh 147 so this dress is too long to wear with sandals it will drag on the floor and I didn’t like the color pattern in person maybe nice for Christmas with the red and green.
