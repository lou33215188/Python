Bought the dress for a summer wedding in DR. Everyone loved it!


DONT BUY THIS CHEAP DRESS.IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. DRESS WAS FADED & DAMAGED.SELLER IS VERY DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE W/ WHEN RETURNING. THEY WILL LIE TO GET YOU TO SEND ITEM BACK & NOT COVER SHIPPING. I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THEM.FIND ANOTHER SELLER BC THIS COMPANY IS UNETHICAL & THE DRESS IS POORLY MADE & CHEAP! THE MATERIAL IS AWEFUL & SIZES ARE SMALLER CHINA SIZES. SAVE YOUR MONEY & TIME.


Love it!


This item was returned. Beautiful dress, but cut too small.


Great fabric and fit wonderfully! I'm 206lbs and had not problem fitting in the large. ğŸ’›ğŸ’›


Perfect


I love it


true to size!


The quality was alright but it was much brighter in person than in the photos. Itâ€™s a no for me. I have it away


Absolutely love it...a lot of compliments.


Beautiful!
