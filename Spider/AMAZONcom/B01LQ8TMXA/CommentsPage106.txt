Love the thicker material, I honestly expected it to be sheer. Very form fitting. I am 5'6/128 pounds and purchased a small. There is not much stretch so be careful!


A little bit too long.


Fits like a glove! Am 5'10" and dress goes to floor can't wait to wear it in Hawaii at our luau!


Haven't actually wore it yet. This dress is really pretty and I love the material of it. It came thread days early too.


Great quality!


Ugly color in person and cheap material...I hate it! Totally disappointed!


fit as described. breathable and stretchy


Very pretty dress and colorful


Great dress! Hugs your body I’m 5’8 130 and ordered a small. Xs wasn’t available in the color I wanted


Love it! It fits great. I'm going to get it in several colors.
