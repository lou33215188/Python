Very Very pretty dress,,This dress was a hit for EASTER..Added a pink scarf to it brought this out even more....


This is a must have beautiful dress. I am 5'2 145 pounds with curves. I had the dress tailored for my height it was too long perfect fit otherwise. I ordered a large.


It's adorable, fits as expected.. hugs your body and looks great overall!


I'm 5"4' 155lbs. I bought a large. Fits perfectly. Could be a little shorter but it's ok. Can dress up in heels or a nice flats. I'm wearing flats in this pic.


This dress firs awesome. I love it


Nice fit & material is nicer then expected, not thin or see through..


Love it so much and super fast


This dress was just to tight.


This dress is beautiful, flowing, and flattering. I may buy another one in another color!
