This is made with such nice material.  LOOVVVEE it!  Bought XXL a I am 5'5 205.  It looks amazing, and with the right undergarments it looks perfecto on.  Now just need something to wear it to.  Oh how I wish I was going on a cruise this year...


I really like this dress it's just really really long and that for me is bad because I'm kinda short lol. I didnt wanna wear heels but I will have to. other than the length its perfect


Loved how the dress hugs my figure and comfortable right through out the evening.


I'm 5 9 and 186 lbs...ABSOLUTELY great for a summer or island wear.. The length of the dress is what made it look more classy and elegant.Goes well with a comfortable heels..❤❤❤. A great bargain at an affordable price


I will need it shortened even with heals- I'm 5'2" and ordered a small which fits great except the length


Haven't use it yet, but looks Amazing. Bright and lovely


After reading review i got large, ordered for my baby shower fit perfect and looked amazing on my baby bump


This gives a very nice shape/ silhouette even if you don't have much of the shape yourself.


This dress is everything I'm 220 5"4 I ordered a Xl and it is perfect. The material is awesome for us on the curvy side. Oh and I tried it in with out shape wear and it still looks nice.


I am a medium but this dress is too big for me


I love this dress! The material is stretchy and it really hugs the curves. It's thick enough that u can't see thru it and u have the option to wear it on ur shoulders or off. I'm 5'9, 168lbs, 34D, 30 waist, 44 hips and i bought a medium. As u can see it's touching the floor but when i move it rides up a bit. Doesn't bother me tho, its super comfortable.
