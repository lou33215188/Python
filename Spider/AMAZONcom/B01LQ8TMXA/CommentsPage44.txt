Cute summer dress.  Material doesn't wrinkle, so that is nice.


I ordered this dress in a large, since I'm a 36G bra size. It fits great!  It is very fitting around the tummy, but that makes it a very feminine dress. I may have to have it shortenend or wear it with heels or wedges. That is my only complaint. It arrived very quickly too. I love this dress!!


Gorgeous but wish I had gotten one size smaller. So worth it


Love this dress, the length is perfect for my height which is 5 feet 11 inches. I'm wearing this dress on my cruise for captains night


Absolutely amazing dress. The first thing I noticed was the fabric is definitely thicker than I expected. That's a plus for sure. Hugs all the right curves. I did order a large knowing sizes from China run small worked out perfectly. I may just buy another because I love it so much. Definitely spreading the one on this dress.


The quality of the material is great and the design is pretty. I normally wear a large but with this dress it fits way too loose and is dragging on the floor with my 5'5" frame. I kept it however with the hopes that after washing and drying, it will shrink a little.


Simple dress but sexy dress fits nice and it's long to floor ğŸ˜€


The color was pale and made the dress look cheap. Returned it.


This is a lovely dress and great value.  It's very pretty and the material is comfortable.  I love it.  It exceeded my expectations.  I plan to wear it on a Hawaiian cruise I will be taking soon.


One of my favorite dresses in my closet! Perfect for a tropical beach trip. It fits as expected, very flattering, and it's long! I'm 5'9 and it actually hits the floor instead of stopping above my ankles.
