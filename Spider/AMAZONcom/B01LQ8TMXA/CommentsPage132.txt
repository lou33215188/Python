NICE DRESS


Bought this for my sister and while we were out the dress ripped along the seam.


Love this dress! I get compliments every time I wear it. Shows off my curves :)


Vibrant colors, just enough stretch. Very comfortable dress. Received lots of compliments.


It hugs the right spots! Material is not thin at all and it is super comfy!


Fits perfect. Shoes all your curves. Will buy another print. Husband loved it ğŸ˜Š

I received sooo many compliments! If you are thinking about it, just get it. Definitely worth it!


I like the dress but it was too large
