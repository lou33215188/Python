AS expected. Good quality.


Very nice. Expected to be too long and will need to go to the seamstress unless wearing 7" heels. :\


Very comfy, cute and stretchy.


I expected the flap to be wider and material is lighter than anticipated. Pretty dress and color though. It fits me well too.


Material was very stretchy, very colorful.  Fit like a tent.


Shows ALL the curves! A little too sexy for this History teacher. I wonâ€™t be wearing it to our High School Academy Ball aka Night in the Tropics, but I will save it for a cruise gown.


Phenomenal !  My husband remarked on this - buy it, trust me!


Runs small order 2 sizes up.


Really cheaply made with a hideous floral print.  Awful


Cute dress but I actually have never worn it because it was too long.  I'm 5'2 and even with heels this doesn't work for me.  It also is skin tight....no forgiveness if you have concerning areas.
