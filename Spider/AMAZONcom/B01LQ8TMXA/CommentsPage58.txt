After reading reviews, thought I should order a size bigger than my normal.  It's a bit bigger than I'd like, but the quality and length is nice. I'm 5'8" and it's nice to have a dress that hits the floor.


This dress looks absolutely stunning. I'm 5'9 175 lbs and I ordered a size medium. If it's perfectly the length is down to my feet. If you have a semi decent shape you suddenly look stunning. This is my second order (different pattern) and my fiance loves it.


This dress is awesome. Im 6" tall, 153 lbs and I bought a medium. Has a little room on the hips but it is flattering. Material is nice and thick. I bought the black n white print.


Absolutely love it. I'm 5'10 and the dress reached my feet. Very form fitting


I really love the dress, I can't wait to wear it on vacation. I had ordered an extra large I'm 5'7 218 and it fit really nice I love the length,the color and the fit❤️❤️


Nice colors, just as shown. A little long for petite short women; but I figured I'll just knot the side for any maxi dress, as I normally do. Looks great.


cute but runs long


For all my tall ladies out there - and I mean 5'10" and over - this is the holy grail for maxi dresses. As a 6-footer, it was just about skimming the ground as I tried it on.


Is this the most comfortable material in the heat? No, probably not. Will it suffice for a night out on a tropical vacation? Yes.


I'm a size 8-10 and bought the XL. Clingy material.


It’s lovely dress


too well over a week to arrive, even with Prime. Not true to size. I am a size 10, ordered a large and its too small.
