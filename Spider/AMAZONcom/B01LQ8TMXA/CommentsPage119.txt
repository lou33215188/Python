Nice dress but made cheaply can see the seams on the bottom slit of dress and top is cut unevenly not for an even more of a summer dress


It fit perfectly. Looks exactly how it looks in the picture and the material is great.


Beautiful dress and really good material... I will post pictures soon...


Great quality and fit.  I should have purchased a large.  But I opted for XLarge. I am smaller on top, so top is a little loose.  However great purchase


its a little fitted and It looked great for my pictures in mexico


Love this dress


Love this dress!! Brings out what little curves I have. Actual dress in pic! Great purchase!


ok


I really love this dress! No complaints! Got a lot of compliments which was awesome. It is quite long so if you are short, you may want to alter it


Beautiful dress, love it.
