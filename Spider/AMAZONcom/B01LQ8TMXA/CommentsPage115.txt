I am 6' tall and wished it were longer but I love the shape of the form fitting dress. The pattern is pretty, too.


The dress didn't work for me. I'm 5'2" with smaller top and larger hips. The small for my hips but hung too low on the top.


thick material


TOTALLY GORGEOUS AND PERFECT FOR FLORIDA OR NICE DINNER ON A TROPICAL VACATION


Fits and looks exactly like the picture...I love it!


Really comfortable. Very stretchy. Could easily get a size smaller than your true size. Good for tall people. Good material!


Beautifully elegant. As someone who RATELY wears dresses.... I love this dress!!


I LOVED this dress! I wore it in the Carribean and received so many compliments.


The fit is perfect. The material doesn't look the same in person. I gave it a 3 star because of the material. It's nice for the price but I wouldn't order from this seller again.


Love it!
