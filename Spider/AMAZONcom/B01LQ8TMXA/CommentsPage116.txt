Love love love this dress! Definitely buying more! Thank u!ğŸ’‹ğŸ’‹


Ordered a Large.  I'm 5'7 and 175lbs.  Fits awesome, shows my curves.  Received many compliments!  Love it!  Fits true to size and hangs below my ankles.


I love this dress, the material is of good quality and I can't wait to wear it. If you are thinking of buying it do it, you will not be disappointed.


I have actually purchased 2 more in different colors.


Really tight, but has a good stretchy feel to it. Thick material. Its nice, I wear a 16-18 and the X-Large fits fine.


It has very vivid colors, the material is not cheap, and fits like a dream.


Very cute. Stretchy and flattering.


Fits good a bit long but I can deal with such


This dress is beautiful!
