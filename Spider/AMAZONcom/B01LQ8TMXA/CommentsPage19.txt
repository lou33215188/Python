Actually had purchased for my daughter  XL she is 5'10 200 lbs, I tried it on 5'6 160 lbs. it fit me perfect I'm not top heavy or hippie I normally wear a 10 or 12, so yes it does run small. However just as a xtra caution did order another color in 2x & 3x hopefully 1 will work for my daughter.


HAPPY SHOPPING


Thanks to all the lovely ladies who posted reviews and pics prior to my purchase, I was able to make an informed decision regarding sizing for this dress. It fits perfectly, and I dont mind one bit that it's polyester LOL! The garment is sewn to perfection, the perfect length and hugs in all the right places with just enough "give" to make it comfortable and flattering. I am 5'7",170 lbs. and purchased size L.


So pretty! I am 5' 6" and weigh 135 lbs... I ordered a small and it fits amazing! I cannot wait to wear it this summer on vacation!!!! vibrant bright colors and it is nice material!!!! I am so happy I bought this dress - thank you!!!!!!!!


This dress is perfect for my vacation. I tried it on last night for my honey and he loves it. He told me this can just be worn on an island, not here in New York. :-)


I think I can get away with it here also but it fits super cute. I can't wait to wear it on our vacation to Aruba.


This dress is gorgeous!!! It fits like a glove and really smooths out the tummy.  Great for small chested women as the ruffle on top really enhances the top half!  I wore it a couple times this past summer and got tons of compliments.  I think I'm going to have a thigh high slit put in front over a leg though because this dress does NOT breath well at all and it gets warm quick.


Arms are tight but it worked for the luau themed party..  the sizing is off as this didnâ€™t fit like an xl. Iâ€™m 5â€™9â€� and 195 and it was snug.


This dress looks so good on me!!! I'm a size 16 and 5'7" and even though it's form fitting it looks incredible on me!! I get compliments all the time!!


I love it. It fits really good and flows at the bottom.


Absolutely love this dress! Thick material so no worries about seeing through to cellulite, doesn't wrinkle, hides what you want hidden and emphasizes all the right areas. Shows some shoulder while still being modest. I am 5'7'', 150lbs and the medium fits perfectly.


This dress is amazing! I am 5â€™7 and approximately 200lbs and the size Large fit perfectly for me! I am choosing to wear shape wear with mine alsoğŸ˜‰ The length is also perfect for my height so if youâ€™re a shorter girl it may be a little long on you. The material is stretchy and does give you that hourglass shape. Very pleased!
