I love this dress! its gorgeous. I got a lot of compliments. Im 5'4 about 130Ib and i ordered a small. Fit perfect. The length is just right with sandals.


Great dress. Wore it to a wedding in Mexico and revived a bunch of compliments.


This dress is amazing, I want one in every color!!! DO NOT hesitate in buying this dress. I can not say enough good things about it!!


Fits like the picture and Iâ€™m no perfect shape!


Am a shorty 5 1" so u know I need to aulter the length, other than that,this dress is a must have and u will fall in love... Colour is as vibrant as in pic.. True to size,and dem curves oh how it hugs u well.. Perfect for my bday garden brunch..


This ran very small I had to return it.


It's long but not too long where it drags on the ground and it's nice a comfy.


Great quality and very flattering fit. My only con is that it is a bit sheer. Nothing that is too obvious. I liked it enough that I bought another in a different print.


This dress is beautiful and well made and the price is unbeatable! However it was too long and a little snug so I returned it :(. I ordered a large and I am almost 5'4" 168 lbs


Very nice everyone loved my dress
