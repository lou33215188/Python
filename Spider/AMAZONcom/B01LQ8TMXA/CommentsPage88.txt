Love it ğŸ¤—


I'm 5'3 170 lbs. With lots of hips, large worked fine. A little long but I'll get it hemmed. Thick material, design was just as shown.


Beautiful dress but runs very small I order pretty bigger than my size and it was too small like petite:/


This dress is everything! Hugs your body perfectly shows off your body as well it's long so if you're short like me five foot one then small will be good for you


Great & comfortable.


Dress was absolutely gorgeous and was true to size.  I wore it to a luau party and received so many compliments.  It was stunning to wear and complimented my physique.  Glad I took a chance and ordered it.
