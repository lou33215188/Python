Absolutely love it! I order an XL and fits well, i will probably get a spanx but it is true to size! Bought 2 styles and plan on buying othersğŸ˜„


I really like the dress! The only problem is that it arrived with a hole under the zipper and I will have to return it. Great for curvaceous women.


This dress fit so comfortably. The fabric was so soft and breathable. Perfect for the beach.


Good quality material and fits well.


She looks great in it and loves it. Is very long too


Love this dress!! Very comfortable and super cute ! Would definitely recommend.


This is a very pretty dress but my problem is that it was not long at all I'm 5'7 and it did not come down to my feet.


Fits like a glove


Love Dress


Runs small. Not flattering if you have any type of belly bulge or love handles.
