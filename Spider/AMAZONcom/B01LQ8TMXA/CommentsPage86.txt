Beautiful fabric, lovely dress, I'm 5"3' and 140lbs and i ordered small which fitted perfectly.


The material is very thick, and sturdy.  I don't  think I'll  be able to make much use of it during these hot Atlanta summers. Super cute... just  wish  it was more flowy, and a thinner  material.


LOVE THIS DRESS EVEN THOUGH IS DOENT LOOK LIKE THE PIC


Dress fit me beautifully, good quality and colors vibrant.


Fantastic fit, beautiful print, and nice durable material. Great dress for a great price.


This dress was perfect! I have really large thighs and a large butt, and this dress looks fabulous on. Im 5'3 and 165 pounds, I got a size large and it fit wonderfully. I will be wearing this on a my honeymoon in the Bahamas!


The material of this is what threw me off i had to return it
