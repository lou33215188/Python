This dress is absolutely gorgeous. I got tons of compliments


This dress is gorgeous! the color is vibrant and perfect!  It's a little longer than I expected and I am 5'11" tall... and the material is thicker than I wanted for my Jamaican vacation but it's perfect otherwise.


Fabric is thick and pattern is pretty. Better quality than expected. Runs really small. I ordered a 4x and I usually wear a 14-16. Fabric is not forgiving at all. Be prepared to see every bump, roll and your belly button through the dress.


Perfect fit, great material. Doesn't fade in the wash. Would buy again. Well worth the price.


Only gave 3 stars because I received the wrong dress! I ordered the floral with navy blue background. I got the bright teal with floral instead. LOL I still like the dress and it fits wonderfully. Very soft and flowing. Fits true to size, not too tight so if you have more curves the material is definitely stretchy, roomy and will be flattering!


Love it, nice fit and sexy. 160lbs and 5'8 in height. The dress fits on top of my feet so good length


Fit absolutely perfect! Being a tall woman myself, I'm always worried when buying maxi dresses. I have a wedding coming up in spring and I wanted something bright and fun to wear. I'm 5'9 about 140 in weight and the medium fit perfect. It's true to size I normally wear mediums.


The dress is a spandex material. Verry tight. Im 5,4 height and 145 pounds. If u got a stomach this dress ain't for you. It just looks to costume like. Now i cant wear it for ğŸ�£ easter. It dont look right on me.


The colors are beautiful, the dress is not that of a cotton feel though. It's almost like a nylon, spandex feel. It is very long. I am 5'5 and still it hit the floor on me. This is my grab and go dress. I have not dressed it up with heel at all, I wear it with a flat shoe or sandal. Fits perfect especially being that it was like a spandex material anyway.


Omg Love LOve LOVE it! it was a hit at our luau the material hugs ur body and is thick which i love im on the slimer side 5'4 125lbs with  larger chest 34 DD i ordered a small and it fit like a glove. i definitely recommend
