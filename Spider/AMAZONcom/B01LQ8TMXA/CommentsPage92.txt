Cute and true to size.  Like alot


It's great just for the one stitching that was missed.


I'm ready for Las Vegas my husband love it I ordered a size XL fits perfectğŸ˜€


Fit perfect! Thicker material than expected and accentuates all curves. Wore on vacation and got so many compliments.  Can't wait to wear again!

Iâ€™m 5â€™7 160lbs and the medium fit perfect. It arrived just when it said it would and it was super fast shipping. The material is super soft and comfortable and stretchy. I love everything about it!
