I love this dress!! Received tons of compliments on it. I ordered the Xl and it fit like a glove! I normally wear a 18/20 so getting an xl so was pushing it. But thankfully all of me fit comfortably in the dress. The material is super thick and stretchy!  So it for perfectly over my curves!


Iâ€™m 5â€™6 132 lbs . The small fits perfect. I canâ€™t  to wear this dress.


Dress fits perfect.. a lil long but I can deal with it. I'm 5'2 and 194lbs.. ordered xxl I believe xl would have been fine


THIS DRESS IS PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT!!!!  MY HUSBAND LOVES IT AND SO DO I....


It fits okay. A little tight. I might give it away to someone.


This dress fits perfect I'm 5ft2 and I bought a medium for my baby shower and got a lot of compliments. It has a lot of stretch because I'm 36weeks pregnant and its comfy and can wear after I give birth.


Wayyyyyy too long and I did go a size down but the dress is so pretty but will need to pay extra to get it altered ... Iâ€™m 5â€™2.... great for taller people


I love the dress but I will return it to exchange. I bought the size Medium (M) and it fit but little loose for me. So I decided to I exchange it for size Small (S). I'm 5,7" and weight 165 pounds. Waist 28.


Beautiful dress! A lot of compliments


I purchased this item back in October and it was a hit, I was looking at love & hip hop last night and saw one of the cast members in the same dress, lol but I loved this dress.
