Fits great but had a hole in the side. Nice stretchy material


I ordered this pretty last minute for a luau party and it was a hit.  I received several compliments and am excited for whenever I get a chance to wear it again.


Never been more satisfied with something I didn't try on. I'm 5'6 130 lbs order a Small and it fits perfectly (might need to wear a heel/wedge) material is thick enough and quality is great.


I lovvvve this dress! It hugs my curves beautifully and is the perfect dress for my upcoming vacation!!


I seriously can't say enough about this dress! It's quality material and it looks so good on! I love it and I'm ordering more!


Fits great! I’m normally an 18/20 and the XL fits perfectly! Material is very forgiving. I’m going to buy more soon.


size not true. Runs Small


Fits great love it


Should've ordered a small fits big


The color of the dress is very dull. It looks pink vs. red.
