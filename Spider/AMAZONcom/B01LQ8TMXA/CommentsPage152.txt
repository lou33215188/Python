Really nice dress, came exactly as pictured.


Fits perfectly... I am 250lbs... I bought the XL and it was so amazing! !!!


Love the dress. Fits perfect. It is a tad long but considering I'm shorty 5'3 that is to be expected.


Love it


Fits well. Didn't get in the time stated


OMG!! THIS DRESS IS SO SEXY,FORM FITTING AND COMFORTABLE. IT'S A LITTLE LONG, BUT I'LL WEAR IT WITH HIGH WEDGES. THE MATERIAL IS THICK BUT NOT CHEAP. I CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR IT ON MY TRIP TO CANCUN..ğŸ˜™


Love my dress, very colorful & perfect fit!


I love it, I received so many compliments.


Fit a bit small


It is lovely in shape and lenght.
