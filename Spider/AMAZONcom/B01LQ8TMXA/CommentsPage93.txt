This is the most beautiful sexy dress I've ever put on. I'm 5'7 124... I sized down and bought an extra small. So glad I did.


This dress is so beautiful and so comfy and the material is very nice and stretchy . I was really hesitant to get it but I'm glad I took the chance .


I didn't really check the measurements provided. I just ordered a small. I am 5'7", 135 pounds. It is very tight fitting around the mid section down to my butt. Like don't wear underwear tight. And somewhat see-through. Maybe I should have ordered a medium? I LOVE the style of the dress though, the colors and the fit.


Fits great love it


LOVE this dress!!!


Bought this for a trip in a few weeks and can't wait to wear it.. fits nice


This dress OMG was a perfect fit! I wasn’t expecting it as I am very slim but wow! The material is very thick. I’m also from the Caribbean so this dress was beautiful in every way


Amazing and sexy. I ordered a large and it fit well.


Very pretty and the material is much, much better than I thought it would be for the price.


I have pretty large hips and the large fits perfect
