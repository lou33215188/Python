Looks great!!! 5'4 191 and pregnant. I ordered a large fits perfect.


I love the fit, its a little long being that I am 5'1 but nothing some sandal wedges cant handle.


Wife loves it, hugging curves and great quality


You will have curves for days in this dress.  Material is very thick, sturdy, and has lots of stretch.  I'm 5'4 200lbs and very curvy.  The large fit me perfect.


Perfect fit ! I am 128 pounds 5"8 and got a small ! Snugs me just right and is more than long enough.


I am in love . The colors are popping. I am 5'1 and it is a great length for me


perfect fit and true to color.


Was told to order up because they ran big, but I didn't need to. Ordering up made it a little too big, had to ordered my size, it would of fit prefect


5’6 142 pounds ordered a Medium and it fit great!


I am 5’5” and 18 weeks pregnant. I ordered a size Small. This dress is very thick but also very stretchy! It’s rare to find a dress you can’t see through. I love it!
