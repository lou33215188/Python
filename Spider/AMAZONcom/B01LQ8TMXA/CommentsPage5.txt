Amazing dress, very very comfortable and beautiful..soo many compliments


Bought this dress for my baby shower-- I was 32 weeks pregnant, ordered a Large, and it still fit amazing! Got compliments on it alllll day. The shoulders stayed put (which is not always the case for off the shoulder stuff) and the stretchy material was very comfortable over my big belly. I'm 5'8" and length-wise it still grazed the floor, but I wasn't tripping on it whatsoever...although I'm sure if I wear it post-pregnancy it will be even longer! I kinda want to buy 5 more of these dresses since they have so many patterns!!


This dress is fabulous! It's stretchy, true to size, and feels great. I'm 5'7", 120lbs, and normally a size 2/4 so the small fit perfectly. It's quite long so heels are a must. Will be purchasing more!


I'm 5'5 160 pounds 36c


large fit great!


Great material for the price not see through very tropical


It is a little long but with heels I'm sure it will still be fine


Great dress for the money. Comfortable and cute. Perfect for our upcoming cruise. Can be worn multiple ways... on or off shoulders or just one shoulder. Super comfortable.


I normally wear a 12 in skirts and pants and about an 8/10 in tops. I would normally get a large but purchased an XL based on other reviews ( glad that I went up a size). The dress is a little long but I personally like that.


My stats....


Height 5'5"


Weight 190 lbs


Bust 38 D


Down side... I have a belly but spanx or something along that line will take care of it.


***Not wearing spanx in the pic.


If you are shorter than 5'5", this will be quite long on you. You'll need to consider getting it hemmed. If you are 5'8" or taller it may hit you at or above the ankle.


Overall a great buy and I plan on purchasing different colors/patterns. Stitching is good and my dress arrived quickly.


I ordered a medium and I'm 5' tall.  It was really long, so long that I cut it above the knee and had enough fabric to make my daughter a dress.  Fit great, nice and stretchy.  Colors are super bright and only one layer of ruffle on top. I wore it for 8 hours and it was super comfortable.


Just received my dress ....love it ! Looks just like advertised, material is comfortable and fits well love the little bit of flare at the bottom . I'm 5 foot even 124lbs I ordered a small and it's perfect , a bit long but with a high wedge will be good . Also found an alternate way to wear neck line . You can tuck the front of ruffle in to dress to create a cap sleeve !


This dress is beautiful! I'm 5'6 and 152lbs---I bought a size L and it fit perfectly!!!


Gorgeous!!!! Can't wait to wear it to Hawaii! I have to lose a little weight to make it zip the rest of the way! I got an XL. I normally fit XL shirts and 16-18 pants. I think a 2X would have fit better without having to lose weight to zip it ğŸ˜Š


The material feels wonderful, seems to be very well made. Great dress for the price!


I absolutely LOVE this dress and the quality is amazing. I got a XL and I normally where large and it fit perfectly. I'm 5'5 and the length was perfect to wear heels or flats, I'm wearing flats in the pic. I wore it to a 50th tropical theme birthday party and got tons of compliments. Everyone wanted to know where it was purchased. Definitely recommend for the price it's a steel.
