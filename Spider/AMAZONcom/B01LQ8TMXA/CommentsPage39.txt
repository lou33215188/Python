It's so pretty on. Fits like a glove!!! I'm 5'4, 140 lbs and purchased a Medium.


I am very pleased with this purchase! I am 5’9 and a size 14.  I bought the large because i wanted it a bit form fitting.  The dress can be worn on the shoulder or off, either way it’s SUPER cute!


This is horrible. Thick like a curtain! Returning!


Very pretty dress, I got so many compliments on it.. I love how it hugged my curves but it was a little too long (I'm 5'3") I had to bunch it up a little in the waist area so it wont drag when i walk.. it still looked great so I'd definitely buy again


I am 5'7" and 200 lbs, 38D and this dress is amazing. I bought a size X-large and it is not too clingy, just the right amount to show your shape but not look like you are trying to squeeze into it.


Wore to a friend's wedding. Received so many compliments and for the Houswives fans, Robin from Housewives of Potomic wore this exact dress during the girls trip episode.


The fabric is too thick for the style and doesn't allow room to breathe. Maybe a 74% rayon,  21% polyester and 5% elastic blend would be a better hit.


Looks super cheap.  I am shocked by the rave reviews.  Honestly, pass this one up.


Just didnt look good on. I questioned my color choice, I bought the black and red.


I just received my package in the mail and I’m so happy with my purchase.  I am 5’2” and about 157 pounds.  I purchased a size M. It fits very well hugs my curves and the fabric is nice and thick with a nice stretch.  I’m going to wear some shapewear to snatch my waist a little further but I really do love it.
