Absolutely Beautiful!


Um the fit was awkward. I am petite 5 ft 140lbs. I have curves and this did nothing for them. It was just tight. I got the small. I am not full chested, so maybe that was a problem. Showed my tummy more than my behind, if you know what I mean. Material was cheap, and the seams started crackling when put on. It was correct size though and hit floor, but there was no train, which is only positive. Maybe try a different color.


I wore this dress to my bridal shower and felt beautiful. I received so many compliments. I plan to purchase another


Gorgeous dress, fit perfect. True to size, was bit long for me but I adjusted it. Perfect attire for my Hawaiian theme birthday party.


Dress is very cute. Looks like the picture shown when you put it on. The material feels cheap, but it looks good on. The colors were exact and vibrant.  The dress arrived promptly and was packaged securely. It did fit a little large, I wish I had ordered a smaller size instead. It does hit the floor as pictured. My daughter is 5'5 and the hem of the dress was draped on the floor as pictured, which my daughter likes because when she wears heels, it will work perfectly.


Cute I love it


Loved for perfect. So comfy. I ordered a large, typically wear a 6 in jeans.


This dress is phenomenal! I got so many compliments. I'm a larger women and it hung to my curves perfectly and was very flattering!


Bought this dress for a trip and it fit perfectly and looked great. I'm 5'9 and 155 pounds and bodybuild and it fit perfect in a Medium.
