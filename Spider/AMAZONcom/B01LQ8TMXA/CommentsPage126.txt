XL is actually a medium.


Dress fit like a glove I am a size 12 and got the XL this dress is very flattering I would definitely recommend this.


Love this dress. Fit perfectly but I had to wear heels because it is long.


However, I am a sewing woman and know a little


about measuiring dresses!  This was pretty


 and quality material but terribly off the size!!!


It fits like a glove! I loved it Thank you so much !!


The size was perfect fit, the colors are vibrant and it's long to the ground on me


Really made for tall people


She loves it dearly. It fits like a glove


Looks different from picture, the pint was not flattering.


perfection
