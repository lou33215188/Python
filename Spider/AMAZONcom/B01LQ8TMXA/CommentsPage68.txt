Love this! Fits perfectly, Can't wait to wear it.


Love love love this dress!! I am 5ft 3 and 216lbs and ordered XL and the dress fit perfectly!! Material is soft and "stretchy". I will definitely be buying more colors!!


Decent color and material, but too small (right now).  Will reorder again when I am closer to my weight loss goal.


This is a very sexy dress!! ğŸ’ƒ However, I was not impressed with the material the dress was made of. The inseam was uneven. Also the color appears faded when stretched around hip area and stomach. ğŸ˜• This item has to be returned. ğŸ˜�


Even though i order a medium size. It still was a little big on me. It's a very nice dress


Beautiful dress! 5-9 180lbs and curvy! Bought a Large and it was a perfect fit!


Love, Love, Love this dress! Fabric is thick and fits like a glove. Want to order more of them! Wonderfully surprised!


My daughter loved it ! She's 5'10" and it came to her ankles.
