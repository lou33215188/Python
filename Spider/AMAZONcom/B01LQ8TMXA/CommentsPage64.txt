This dress was the star of the luau in Hawaii.  It stretches. I got a medium, but a large woulda gave me a little more room.  I'm about 5.3 190ish...  I ordered 2 from this store


This dress fits great. I'm 5'3", 160 lbs, 36D and I ordered a Large. It was long but that's typically my problem. I'm getting it hemmed so no big deal. The material was nice,  and I had room in the dress which I liked. Definitely,  recommend!

Cute but too small for me.


Great deal! It fits nicely with good quality material. Im 5'5" so it's a bit long in flats, but with wedges/heels it's perfect.


The dress has a nice stretch to it that was very accommodating to my curves. I'm 5'8" and it was the perfect length for me.


Love how thick and stretchy the material is. I ordered 3.  If you plan on using durring pregnancy the darker colors fade as material stretches so I'd reccomend the lighter color or bigger size.
