Great material, has some stretch, super flattering for most body types. I'm 5'1 117lbs, bought a small because the reviews said the material was stretchy. For perfect!


I love my dress it's beautiful fits amazing body con type. The teal color goes good with my caramel skin tone. This dress is long which is great for tall women. I'm 5'7 and it's skims the floor I'm ordering 2 more dresses it's my all time favorite. It goes well with Florida wheather. A must buy. Lots of compliments in this dress


This dress exceeded my expectation. Quality material was great.Fitted well in all the right places love love love the dress got so many great compliments at my Hawaiian brunch.


So cute! Great for curves!


Love the color and the print. There is a side-zip on the dress that I wasn't aware of.


Beautiful dresse I just love what I ordered


Very cute and tropical! Bought it to wear in the Caribbean.  I'm 5'7" and it's an inch or so too long.


Itâ€™s a beautiful dress that can be used casually or an evening out. I was doubtful because of my baby bump, however it fit wonderfully and very comfortable. Can be used during pregnancy and after.


I was nervous when ordering this, but the fit is so flattering! I would recommend it to anyone!


Looks great fit  and fits good.
