I'm 5'8" and about 150lbs. I love the fit and the length. I can wear high heels with it if I want. The material is a little thick so it's not a dress for hot days.


I didn't get the right dress. I ordered black and white and I got navy and white and a different design. Fits as expected. 3 stars because I didn't get what I ordered.


Love this dress. Received so many compliments


Love it fits perfectly. I got plenty of compliments


Too large. Print not as described in picture.


This dress came in with the floral print as expected. It shipped to me right on time for my trip to Miami. The dress was a bit larger and longer than expected but these were minor. I received many compliments on it and am overall happy with my purchase.


The color is true to what you see.  A bit thick but who cares.  I love it and highly recommend.  I usually wear medium to small depending on material and small fits perfect.


It fits very well, and was thicker than I expected. I would definitely buy in another color/pattern.


This dress is so much better than what you’d expect for the price!!! It’s made out of really high quality fabric and the side zipper helps create a really great shape on your body. I’m 5’10 and love to wear heal... and this maxi is long enough for me to do so. I will get a lot of use out of this dress
