Awful. Cheap and shoddy work.


Love it fits perfectly. True to size.


Good


Purchased this for my daughter who has a tiny frame size 4 , ordered this dress in small and slightly large but dress is so adorable and well made. Would recommend this dress but you  may need to order a size down.


great product at a great price!


I absolutely love this dress.  I have received lots of compliments on it.  It is clingy where it should be and is very comfortable.  I am only 5'3" and with heels it was not too long.


Love this dress! Quality material that is well made and great fit! Fits true to size I'm 5'2 160 lbs. and purchased the medium. It did not drag the floor and I wore flat sandles. It can be dressed up or down - I received lots of compliments. Probably not the best choice for tall women. Otherwise I would definitely recommend.


This dress is everything !! It fits very well!! So happy I purchased it !! You will not be disappointed in this purchase! I took a chance and The review pictures don't do it enough justice !! I will come back for the othe color ..lovvvvve


Love it. 5'6"' 150lbs. Size L. It's long, but heels solve that.


i got so many compliments when i wore this!! it fits beautifully
