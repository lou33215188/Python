Love this dress on me and the quality is great!


Dress fits nice, but u should order a size up from ur regular size. I order a medium, it was too tight. Order a size large fits perfectly


Very nice material, on time delivery, fits perfect, length is great. It looks like it does online.


It's pretty but a lil snug for the size listed


too many seams also


Very pretty just showed off to many of my imperfections.


This dress makes a statement and highlights a woman's curve.....I love this dress


I LOVE this dress. I bought two prints for an anniversary trip to the Dominican Republic and got so many compliments. The material is very forgiving and hugs your curves in all the right places. For reference, I am 5'9" and 180 and I bought the XL.


Lovvvvvvve it!! I'm 5"5 and 175pds. I got a medium and it fits perfect and I love it!!


Love good material
