This dress was perfect for the beach wedding i went to! I got a size medium and Iâ€™m 5â€™8â€�, 165 lbs and it fit great! I got so many compliments on this dress!!!


I loved it!!! I'm 5'5 and weigh 195. The length was just right...everyone was complimenting me the whole night! The sides of shoulder never came up like some blouses do. I totally would buy it again in another color.


It's ok, it's a pretty dress. I received a lot of compliments however it's not flattering to my shape.


Liked the material, but did not fit. Go up in size.


you will have to take it up if your on the short side, great fit and looks amazing on


I got alot of compliments.  It fits as expected, Ive been buying clothes trying to find my perfect match because I did gain weight but I would say I am not a large yet I guess..


Love it so many compliments â�¤ï¸�ï¸� Really nice fit and color


I absolutely love this dress! It is so beautiful. Material is not cheap at all. I really like it. You will love it too!


This dress is gorgeous! It is well made and comfortable. I will be returning, though, only because I don't like the shape of my body and it is a fitting dress.


This dress is awesome quality, not thin material. I wore this for my tropical themed birthday party and received so many compliments. Wish they also had it in solid colors. I ordered a large.
