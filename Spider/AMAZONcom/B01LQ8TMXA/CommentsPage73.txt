I love this dress. Received so many compliments when I wore it. I purchased a medium and the fit was perfect except for the length. Im 5ft and the dress had about 3 inches of extra length. I simply cut the excess and hemmed it. Quick fix.


I got what I expected!  I can't wait to wear it.


I purchased this dress while 5 months pregnant. I am 5' 9" and I ordered an XL(which fit perfectly) the dress swept my feet while walking and I received so many compliments.


Beautiful, super comfortable dress. Got at least 3 compliments wearing it


A GREAT EVENING COMPLIMENT FOR A SUMMER DAY. MADE MY BUTT LOOK GREAT!


well judging from the size chart I wear a medium, however, receiving the item I've realized the dresses run big, so I should have purchased a small!


Love the dress.  Great fit.


Super cute!!! Iâ€™m in Love


I got many compliments, ordered to wear to a bbq......need I say....heads turned....compliments for the dress!!!


I ordered the navy/white print (I thought it was black/white). The quality is very good on this dress. Its not see through at all. I am 5'7" and it's the perfect length with high heels. I weigh 145lbs and it's fits perfectly with the size Medium.
