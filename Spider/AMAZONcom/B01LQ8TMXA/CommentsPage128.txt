I look so lovely in this dress


Fits like a glove


I was surprised that this did not fit after reading the reviews.  I am 5'9" and weigh 178 lbs. so I ordered a large.  'Not even close to being big enough, and according to the reviews, I was hoping this dress would be long enough.  It was an inch off the floor.  There's no chance of wearing heels with this one.  I don't get it.  There's another review (with a photo) that the gal is 5"10" and 250 lbs. and she ordered an XL and loved it?????  Weird.  I really like this dress, so I am trying an XL and will do a review when I receive the dress...


Too long basically
