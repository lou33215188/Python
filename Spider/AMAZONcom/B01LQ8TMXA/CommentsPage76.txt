The print doesn't look like the picture but overall its ok for a $20 dress. I thought the color was black and white but its blue and white.


Nice dress overall


Runs large ...US L is actually L .. but it's very long...


Oh how i loved this dress in the photo. Fits as in photo but way too short. Parts of material seem washed out too. Returned for a refund


Ordered a small.....fits well but if you want it a lil looser get a med


This is beautiful. Very long!


The fabric is so fake, I feel like I can barely breathe in it. Seriously am doubting if I'd actually wear it


LOVE IT LKOOKS BEAUTIFUL ON ME


Love this dress!!!


Long, long, long dress! Looking for someone to shorten it so I can wear it on the cruise.  I am 5'4.
