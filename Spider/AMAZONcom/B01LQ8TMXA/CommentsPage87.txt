Perfect summer dress for all occasions. Cute casual dress with a flat sandal. Slip on a low heel and a little jewelry and head to an upscale dinner. Quality could have been better, Sincethis is a summer dress the cheap quality was not a deal breaker.


I don't care much for the material.


Loved the fit but the fabric is cheap, and why couldn't it just come in black.... why does there always have to be designs...


Good quality but had to give it as a gift.  Runs small.


I'm 5'1 38 DD bust with flat tummy and narrow hips, ordered Large ant it fit great, very flattering. Long on me and I no longer wear hills. Will have to hem, maybe I could have even ordered Medium. Bought more in different patterns. Love


I bought this dress for my vacation to Destin. I got so many compliments and the dress was very flattering. Will be buying more!!


My daughter LOVED this dress.  She looked stunning in it.


beautiful dress. Bought for my niece and it fits her perfectly :)


Design/color as pictured; Fits beautifully. I was concerned that the dress wouldn't be long enough  (I'm 5'11) but it was and I love it. I'll be ordering again in another color.


cute.
