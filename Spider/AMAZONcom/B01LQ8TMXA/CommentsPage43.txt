I was skeptical about buying a dress on Amazon, but this dress was AMAZING! Fit great. I am 5'7" and it allowed me to wear heels and showed the a little bit of the toe. I got a lot of compliments on it...will definitely buy another from this company! Good product and good price. -Matts Wife


I gave this dress three stars because of the color and the length. The color is not the same as picture and its extremely long. The fit was as expected I'm usually a 1x 16/18 and I purchased the xl from reading others reviews.


Will fit anyone. Nice bathing suit type material. My only complaint is that the flap part is kind of long but I'm only a B-cup. I'm 5'3, 35-28-36 and the length is perfect. I got a small.


This is a very vibrant color dress. The op how ver was a bit big on me. Otherwise great piece


Ordered 2 and another one on the way!!  I am 5'9" and this dress reaches the floor. I ordered a medium. Love it! The picture is the blue one i ordered.


I got so many compliments on this dress!  I wore it to a wedding and it was a hit.  Super comfortable, warm, fit perfectly.  Not sheer at all which was a relief. Seems very quality made.  And I thought the length was perfect (I'm 5'3" and I wore 3" platforms).  No hemming needed!


Very disappointed with this order! I was so excited because of the positive reviews but this dress arrived days later and the size M fits me like a L/XL. Not appealing. I am 180lbs and very curvy and was hoping for a snug fit. a small would have been better. Will be returning.


Happy to have bought this. It made me look beautiful in Hawaii.


Dress was better than expected! Nice material that hides flaws and the colors were fabulous. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's long and will need to be shortened, but for the price I still feel like I got a great deal!


It's a pretty dress, it doesn't stay in place like the shown on the model.
