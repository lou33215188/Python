I am 5 '9 190lbs... very curvy... this dress fits in all the right places.. Does run small anz i figured it would so i ordered an xtra large... Im tall so it fits just right in flip flops but if you are taller than 5'8.. you cant wear heels and think it will be long enough... lol. Be careful of long legs..


Sexy and stylish!! The colors are vibrant and it fits well.


Too small


This dress is very pretty; however, it's very clingy and a lot smaller.  I should have went one size larger.  But fitting as is, this is my critique.  This is more for someone with a washboard stomach and bigger breast, perhaps D or above.  I'm a C cup on top and this dress made me look flat on top.  I did not like it at all.


It fits well. Hugs the curves.


took this dress on a cruise and it was perfect.  follow the size chart and you will be fine.  good material and quality was good.


Love the color, length, fit and quailty of the material.  I am 187 lbs and 5'6" and this size large dress fits me perfectly.  It is more than worth the purchase price. I am very pleased with this maxi dress and looking forward to wearing it during my August cruise.  2 photos attached.


This is a well made dress, nice material, not too thin. Perfect for hot summer days; received tons of compliments!


If it's too tight in an area (butt) the color fades and the dress looks damaged.  I guess I need a larger size.


Cute dress but too long even for my 5' 7" frame
