I'm 5'2 and ordered a large bc other reviews said it was snug. It was super long even with heels, would definitely have to have it hemmed. The print was vibrant and cute so no complaint there. The material was SUPER clingy and showed every bump, dimple and roll which I'm not cool with. I ended up returning it. It did convince me to hit the gym though haha!


I'm 5'8, 165lbs rectangle frame, lg is perfect.  This dress is amazing!  Soft, cool fabric.  The offshoulder is very flattering, taking eyes away from the middle.  My husband saw me try it on & gave me the "come hither" look, so this is a win!!


I get sooo many compliments on this dress!!! Fabric has the perfect amount of stretch, really comfy!!!


I love love loveeeee this dress ! Im 5'8 and it touches all the way to the floor ! And you ladies with long legs know how aggravating it is to try and find a cute maxi dress and touches the floor ! Highly recommend ğŸ”¥


I absolutely love this dress. I have worn it to a wedding and to a work awards party and got a MILLION compliments both times. I'm 5'9 and curvy on bottom and an XL fit great.


Material is thicker which is great because it doesn't have a lining. Can wear undergarment underneath w/o detection. Dress is flowing & fabric feels good to the skin. I'm 5'2 & 165 lbs & a large fit me well. Dress is long but can be worn with flats.


This dress is gorgeous on and fits perfectly! Wearing it on my honeymoon!


I love this dress.  Although it is ankle length on me, the fit is flattering and sexy.  I intend to shorten the hem to just below the knee.  Yes, I should not have to alter a new item, but my height and body type leave me very few options to wear anything as purchased. This dress is a keeper.


Fit beautifully. Showed my curves. Wore it to Easter church service with a white jacket then took jacket off for a different look for Easter brunch. Big hit with everybody. Will definitely order another one for Mother's day


when my friend saw me dressed in it she said it gives me the mermaid look. she loved it, I do also. very feminine. I'm 5"4' and 147 and I got M and it fits amazing. very happy with the purchase.
