The length is too short! My feet sticks out! And I’m only 5’4”. Otherwise nice dress for the price.


Beautiful dress with great colors. I will definitely order more items from this seller. Oh I am 5'3 So I will have to hem it but other than that it's great!!!


Very comfy.nice dress. True to size. Good dress for the summer time. I wore it to the boardwalk.


My all time favorite dress! I wish I could buy it in every color. Got so many compliments and for a plus sized woman like me it was flattering in al the right spots! Definitely recommend purchasing you won't regret it!!!!


The size was a little smaller in the waist than the measurements on the chart indicated but I like the product. Also, I am 5' 10" and the dress actually hit the floor! This is a great dress for taller than average ladies.


Very cute dress but runs kind of long. I'm 5'5 -5'6 ordered an XL needed a Large. I will reorder my correct size and also another color as well the dress is super cute and fits good. and the material is good as well.
