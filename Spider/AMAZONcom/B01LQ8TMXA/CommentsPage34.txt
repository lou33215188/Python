Very pretty dress, I bought it go take on vacation and it is a great fitting dress and the material is a good quality!


If your looking for a nice dress, for a decent price to wear to a tropical place, then this is your dress. I am tall (5'11) and this dress still came to my ankle. The material is thick and not see through, and it doesn't look cheap at all. You will look like a slender tropical goddess in this dress.


WOW!!! This is a great maxi dress.  The fabric is soft and the design is beautiful.  I can't wait to wear. Highly recommend and I will definitely purchase more from this company/


So pretty and the fabric feels great! I think I want to buy other prints. It is very flattering :)


I'm 5'6 1/2, 170lbs, I bought the large..it fits perfectly.


I wanted to love this so much. Didn't return it in time and mad at myself for it. This is only really acceptable if you're 80 years old (except it's superrrr tight so please don't) OR in Hawaii. That's it.


 Love love love this dress. I am 210lbs 5’3” 36” waist and 49” hips and I ordered a large. I am a 38DD so the fabric does stretch a bit in the boobie area however, it’s not really noticeable bc of the ruffled part that hangs in the front.


Beautiful dress!!! Initially, I thought the material looked cheap, but when I tried it on it looked really elegant and classy. I received a TON of compliments. I’m 5’6 and 175. I ordered an L and it fit really well. The length was also really nice. I plan on ordering other colors.


Love this dress. Wearing on my cruise. I’m 5’3 so i have to wear with some wedges but with the shoes it’s the perfect length.


Very flattering and beautiful dress, for a medium initially but it was too big, I would suggest ordering a size smaller for a perfect fit :)
