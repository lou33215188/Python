Love it!


Wore this on disembarkation day. I wish I had worn it while in the Bahamas, but I had way too many clothes to choose from. It was more than I expected! Super cute and comfy!


Great material. In love!!! Purchased a large. 160lbs 5’4


5'6 210LB THE XL IS PERFECT..THIS DRESS IS A SLAM DUNK


I'm 5'9 and 200lbs and the xl fits well. I could've done a large though. Very pleased.


Very pretty and nice made,  but sadly I returned because I  did not like the fit.


Very tight, I ordered large and it was still a bit tight. product is somewhat as described however the fabric is not soft at all and very hard to wear.


I like the fabric and the overall ‘cling’ of the dress. I’m only 5’2” so I had to get it hemmed. But otherwise it was a beautiful dress!


The Fit was good , the colors were just off to me.


For the $ this dress is super cute. Fits perfectly!
