I thought I was black but the color is navy blue ... in either case it's very pretty I love the texture


Great quality/fit.  Ordered a small.  Iâ€™m 5â€™4â€�, 138, waist: 26, 34DD...somewhat long, but length will rectified with wedge heels (or any heels for that matter)...Recommend!


Great fit for sure cute just a little cheap lookin


Itâ€™s pretty. I like the color I just wish it was made for short girls too. Iâ€™m 5ft (I wear a medium) and it drags the grown with heels ...I will have to get the dress altered.


I really like this dress.  It compliments me in every way.  I am cury and weigh 165-175 (5'5").  I will buy other  colors.


One word...AMAZING!!! Hands down my favorite dress I've ever owned! Perfect for maternity dress also!


This dress fits amazing, however the colors are a little too bright for me.


This dress is so beautiful and fits well! I purchased for our trip this summer to Punta Cana!  Nice material that stretches to hug you in all the right places. I am 38C and 145 and purchased the large.


XL size dress 5'6 210 lbs. I really love this dress, it hugs the curves perfect. Received a lot of compliments. The material is super stretchy


Love it although I had to get it altered which cost me more then the dress, not complaining because this is definitely one of my favorite dresses.  ğŸ‘�
