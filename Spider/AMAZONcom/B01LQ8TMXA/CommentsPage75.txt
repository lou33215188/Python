Love this dress.  I am only 5'1" so I had to have it hemmed.  But other than that, it fits perfectly. The material is thick and it hugs you in all the right spots!


Loved this dress!! Received so many compliments.


Love this dress! I'm 5'4" and it was a little long but not noticeable when I pulled it up around the waist.


When I got this dress the zipper was broke didnt want to have to send it back and wait on another one to be sent out so I had to fork out 18 more dollars to get the zipper fixed...ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


Gorgeous body on long summer dress


Colors are much duller in person. Dress definitely looks more vibrant in the pictures. I'm 208 lbs, 5' 5", 36D-36-44 (25 weeks pregnant).... I got an XL, and it still has quite a bit of room. Definitely need a size Large. Overall, decent item for the price.


Giving it to my mom or selling it. Too big but beautiful dress.


This is a great dress! It's super stretchy and very flattering!


The fit is amazing! The material is thick and seems to make me look smaller. It definitely shows nice curves. I bought an additional one. Love this dress.


Everyone loved it. Got a lot of compliments
