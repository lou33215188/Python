I got this dress as a xmas gift from my friend.I was hesitant to wear this dress because I am in my late fifties and never wore a body con dress before.However,I got so many, many  compliments that I am going to buy more colours.Thank yu.


This dress is so perfect! Exactly as I expected. Definitely recommend


I haven't tried it on yet, I'm just made that is not black and gray/white..... It's blue, like lighter navy blue. I'll still wear but I won't be happy about it


This dress is my absolute favorite! I am 5'9 150lbs 32 B and I ordered a small. the material is stretchy so it fits well.


Arrived in time and in great condition.


I'm 5 ft. Ordered a small.


It was too long and the bust was a bit big.


However, the adjustments were made via a seamstress.


I gave five Stars because the dress allowed for easy altenacious without spoiling the style.


I love the material.


Will post a picture when I do wear it.


I really like this dress. I wore it to St. Martin for a girls trip. The design matches beautifully with the locale.


This dress is beautiful and stretches over my body well.


Wore this when I was 3 months pregnant and received a lot of compliments! Still have it and love it!


Worked out great for a Cuban themed party! I'm 9 months pregnant and ordered a large. Good length. Thick stretchy material. Amazon comes through again.


I would of given it 5 Stars but it had this weird zipper on the side. It didn’t have to be there. Overall it didn’t take long to ship. Nice packaging and fit well
