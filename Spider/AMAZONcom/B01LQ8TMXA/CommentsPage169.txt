The material is nice and would be flattering if it was truly an XL! I instantly knew it was too small when I pulled it out of the package. More like a size Medium at any department store. They completely skimped on fabric to save money! I'll have to return it unless I magically lose 40lbs by tomorrow!


I bought this based on it having so many positive reviews.


This dress is hideous. The fabric is so cheap. It reminds me of old lady nightgowns. A lot of women in the photos can certainly make this dress look good, but I cannot get over how poorly made it is. The fabric was itchy and gross and just not flattering on me at all. Returning immediately and would not recommend.
