Very sexy....


I LOVE THIS DRESS!! It fits perfectly for the size I normally wear. I usually range between a Large and an XL (12/14); I bought a Large and it fits amazing!


The material is not a bretheable fabric, the shoulder roushing does not come as low as pictures, where when trying to accent the top of the breasts it's less than what is to be desired.


Nice change for maxi received so many compliments !!!!


The dress is not what I expected the body of the dress fits but the shoulders fit as if there were 2 shoulder straps so my chest hung out. Very disappointed


I'm 150lbs and a small fit me great. Length is just right hits the floor a bit but with nice sandals would be cute.


Love it!!!!


Lovely dress ..perfect length for 5"7 , fabric is good definitely not see through ...love it ..good buy for the money


Super gorgeous dress. Especially if you’re a curvy woman. It definitely compliments your curves and makes you look slim. I totally recommend it, you won’t be disappointed.


The dress is very long which I love fits very well color is just beautiful.
