very beautiful, but too long for me


Happy with my purchase.  Wore it on my honeymoon in Hawaii and got a bunch of compliments.  Need to have a party so I can wear it again =)  The material does show off your curves, so if you are not comfortable with a "skin tight" dress then its not for you.


Returned this dress! The fit is as expected. The fabric feels cheap and it clings in an unflattering way. I had purchased this to wear to my daughters destination wedding in Mexico but because it is 100% polyester, it would be miserable in the heat!


Perfect!!!!!!!! Opened it Friday morn, wore to brother's wedding on Friday afternoon!! Many compliments! I am 5'5, 186 lbs, 38D bra size, hippy, I got a size Large. I like that the material is not flimsy & see through.


Really comfortable and looks nice!! It was too long for me but got it fixed.


Lovely vacation dress.


Very pretty. Just too small


Loved this Alil to long.But other than that loved it got a lot of  complements


i got a large. I will definitely need a nice wedge heel but i love it.


Gorgeous
