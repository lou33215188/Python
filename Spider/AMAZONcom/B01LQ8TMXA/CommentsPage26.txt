I love this dress, my husband also said how nice it looks.  The material is stretch and comfortable, looks just like the picture, hugs your curves. This is perfect addition to my vacation wardrobe.


One of my best purchases. It was love at first sight. I felt amazing and received lots of compliments.


Beautiful dress. Fit perfectly over my baby bump. Wore it to a luau for and friends birthday and I got so many compliments! Would definitely recommend.


This dress is amazing!!!!! If you were a size 8/10 in women's a medium fits perfect! Even if you are larger breasted this dress looks wonderful on the body!! I bought to wear at a wedding and it was a hit!!!


Wore this for my babyshower and it fit great. Material is stretchy and breathable. Best part I can wear it again minus the pregnancy belly! Got so many compliments on it.


BEAUTIFUL DRESS.  I USUALLY WEAR A SMALL 5'2" 107 LBS, BUT IT WAS TOO TIGHT IN THE MIDDLE SO I EXCHANGED IT FOR A MEDIUM.  RECEIVED THE MEDIUM AND IT'T STILL TOO TIGHT IN THE MIDDLE/HIPS AND MY HIPS MEASURE 34" SO I GIVE UP.


I love this dress. It fits well and sucks in your fat. My husband loved in on me also, but my daughter thought that it showed too many of my curves. I can't help it if I'm curvyğŸ¤·ğŸ�½â€�â™€ï¸�


This is so beautiful, I'd buy every color if i could lol a little big but a must buy ladies. I purchased the red and white one, worried it would be see thru but it's definitely not. I'm 5'4 I weigh 130 and ordered a medium. Hope that helps!


The material is a little thicker than I expected, but it still feels nice. I'm concerned I will be hot. I ordered this for a destination wedding in the Dominican. Very flattering. And long enough to wear heels!


Gorgeous dress and true to size. The material is heavy and not cheap or see through. It fit like a glove and accents my curves. The length was perfect as it touched the floor just a bit to perfection. Exactly the way you see it. Beautiful colors and elegance. Love my dress off shoulder looking super cute and sexy. I'm busty ontop on it fit perfect I got a medium. I'm 5'2 145lbs hope this helps you as the other reviews helped me. You will love this dress. See different colors I purchased 2. I'm in love.
