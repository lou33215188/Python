Beautiful dress! I absolutely love it! It’s figure flattering, The colors and fabric are amazing, received many compliments, I will buy other colors for sure!! I’m a tall lady 5ft 9 and weigh 221 lbs, I bout an XL and it fits perfectly and the length is perfect!


I'm 5'1 135lbs and I ordered a small. It fit perfectly in the body and length. I'm only wearing flats and it was not extremely long. The material has some stretch to it which made it easy to move around and it's lightweight to wear on warm days. I wore it for my nieces graduation and got so many compliments. I'll be purchasing more!!


LOVE THESE DRESSES. THIS IS MY 3 RD ONE. I GOT 2 FOR A CRUISE AND ONE FOR MY BABY SHOWER. IM 7.5 MONTHS PREGANANT AND GOT A LARGE. CURRENTLY IM 5'10 AND 180LBS AND 34DDD WITH 43" HIPS.....BEFORE I WAS PREGNANT I WAS 165LBS AND THE LARGE FIT PERFECTLY STILL.  ITS A LITTLE SNUG SINCE IM PREGNANT BUT WANTED A FITTED DRESS AND ONE I CAN STILL WEAR AFTER THE BABY.GREAT MATERIAL, FIBRANT COLORS AND ACTUALLY LONG! ITS HARD TO FIND DRESSES I CAN WEAR WITH HEELS THAT IS STILL LONG. THE RED DRESS IS A LARGE AND IM PREGNANT. THE FLORAL ONE IS ALSO A LARGE BUT NOT PREGANT. LOL. HOPE THAT HELPS SOMEONE


I love this dress. It fits snugly but not to tight on my curves. I ordered a L. Measurements 38-35-45. The dress is to long though. I am only 5'4. My seemstress will fix that. The pattern does a nice job of distracting from my "kangaroo pouch" in front. It would be easy to have shapewear underneath. Colors are vibrant. I am definitely thinking of getting other patterns. Matter of fact, my best friend ordered one after she saw my picture. Standard shipping was 1 week.


Great material.  Too long for me 5'5" 118 lbs.  Tacked a little and pinned with safety pin on the side that created "wrapped" skirt like looks.


And that created bottom to be more fitted and I loved it and people loved it so much that so many stranger came up to me "I LOVE your dress!" at 375 people gathering Hawaiian dress dance and dinner party.


Honestly, I wasn't expected the material to be this good for this price.  Well Done.  I am about to order different print but same design.


Highly recommended.  Very stretchy.  I was worried because I ordered this dress to go to dance party and I am a dancer.  I had NO issue dancing any dance Tango Waltz Cha Cha Cha Swing Hustle you name it.  It would not prevent you from dancing.  Get yours ;)


Just tried it one and it is a gorgeous dress! Super lightweight for the ongoing California heat but thick enough to be flattering. Love the mermaid shape and I was pleasantly surprised at the thickness of the material. Generally, I expect very thin material with a crappy zipper that shows off EVERY detail of your body, especially what you're insecure about. NOT WITH THIS DRESS. This purchase has exceeded my expectations and the zipper works well. I hope they come out with this model in solid colors next. I will buy one in every color and I'm considering buying every print offered for now.


I bought this dress for a luau. I am 5"5 143 pounds. I ordered a medium. I had to get the dress hemmed because I chose to wear flat shoes. I am pear shape, and this dress was so cute. I did wear some added spank


( flesh colored )with the dress. I'm 49 years old, so need some additional help here and there.  The top part I let fall down on the shoulders and it was a tiny bit big, but nothing to complain about.


I absolutely love love Love this dress! I love that I’m know for wearing crazy styles and wild prints, so this gets an “A” on my book! Also, (I’m 5’ 9.5” & 125lbs) I got a size medium...and the length is great!!!... mostly if you wanna be barefoot, cause any heel would make it too short. Also, the fabric isn’t the ‘best’ but it’s certainly not garbage, and I’m sure it’ll feel nicer after a few tumbles in the washer....overall A+ .... there were several ways I invisioned this purchase going wrong.... print... color... size....style... length... So glad everything worked out!


I was not sure this dress would fit because I'm 6'2", 42G and curvy so I thought the ruffle in the front would lay funny but it didn't. This is a nice dress, the fabric does have stretch to it BUT it will mess up the color design and white stretch will show through I wish they made a 1x-3x in this, I would buy one in every color!  It is comfortable and the color is vibrant, it lost one star because the fabric snags easily.


I bought Turquoise and Navy not sure which one would look better on (usually dark colors make us ladies look thinner thus my choice to purchase both) Well they both look great!!!!! Actually the turquoise looks better, but both look great!  I'm 5'6 (5'9-5'10 with heels) 160, 38D and the large fit perfect!  I can't wait to wear this dress, it's by far the best buy so far!!!!  It made me look thinner and it's very sexy!


I'm keeping both dresses because they both look great on!
