The dress looks EXACTLY like the picture. I've shopped a lot of consumer apps that quote lesser price for similar style and items, what you gain in lower price you lose in quality and shipping time. I'm convinced. I will only show Amazon for guaranteed quality!!! Buy this dress!


I love the way it looks on me. It's a nice material and is curve hugging. When I took it out of the package I thought that i might be too long (i'm 5'1), but after I put it on it stopped at just the right length for me to wear sandals or heels. I definitely recommend this dress for my curvy girls, especially my short curvy girls. I will be getting this in other prints.


This dress fits my frame like a glove! It is so cute and get me compliments wherever I wear it!


I really like this dress. Full purchased in a XL. 5 "8 1/2 and it touches the floor but not as wide at the bottom as it is in picture.  I still like it,  I'm size 38ddd, wide shoulders, 190 and I feel girly girl ğŸ˜Š


Vibrant colors and it makes me feel happy.


Yassssssssss!  Absolutely amazing!  Fits perfectly the only star removal is because it is long for a 5'3 footer!!!! LOL. I will be buying more patterns.


Love this dress. just a tad bit too big but it'll work. I'm 5'9" 185 pounds usually wear 10/12.


This dress is everything!!! Fabric isn't too thin (often a problem with sun dresses) and colors are vibrant. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the length. I'm 5'2 and I have to get it altered in order to wear


This dress was waaaaay better than I expected nice and thick not see thru long but i can wear with heels or flats im 5'3 155 i got a medium and its PERRRRFECT


It's a beautiful dress and the fact that I'm short 5'2 and had to get it hemmed is not the fault of the manufacture. This is why I posted" fit as expected". I love it


and would buy again. Very tropical and great for any summer event. Just get it hemmed if it's too long. Well worth it.


I bought this dress for myself and my daughter. I ordered her a large and it fit her perfectly! She's 5'8 & 180 lbs. The length of the dress is just right for her but a little long for me since I'm only 5'4. I also tried the large on which fit nice but I know the medium is the ideal size for me since I'm 160 lbs. The material is nice and the colors are vibrant. Can't wait for mine to come in!!
