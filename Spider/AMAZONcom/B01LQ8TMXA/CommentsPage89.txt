OMG! Better than expected, fits perfect  (ordered XL). The length is just right. Can't wait to wear.


the shoulder where the elastic sits its a bit wide i would most definitely have to get that look at and the material is not flattering at all the color is flat and dull its not as pretty as the picture but its a go its ok


Please buy this! You will not be disappointed. I received Soooooo many compliments on this dress for mg cruise. Hugs you in the right places


Wore this ensemble to the zoo and the animals went wild ğŸ˜œğŸ˜‚


Nice material but a little tight. Will have to lose weight to wear


Beautiful. I have no complaints. Thank you


LOVE this dress! Was a little long, but I was able to have it hemmed. Soooo cute.


I purchased 3 of these dresses. 2 were for myself and 1 was a gift. I love this style of dress. It runs a little big so you may be able to go down a size. Over all I would recommend you can't beat the price


Cheap fabric


not quite what I expected
