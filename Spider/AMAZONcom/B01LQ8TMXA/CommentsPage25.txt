I absolutely love this dress! It hugged all of my curves in the right places. I received so many compliments. I'm 5 feet 140 pounds. I ordered a medium. It's lengthy, but a cute heel will correct that.


This dress is amazing for a curvy woman.  The top ruffle can even disguise the girls if you don't want to wear a bra.  Fits all the right places and the design helps hide imperfections.  No spanx needed.


If you have a belly as I do, it's not for you!

The dress looks phenomenal on me!  I wore this to a wedding shower and received tons of compliments.  The dress is nice and thick and it can hide your problem areas well.  I am 5'6' and weigh 205 and with a pair of spanx this did a great job of hiding my lower belly pouch.  I chose to wear the dress on my shoulders.
