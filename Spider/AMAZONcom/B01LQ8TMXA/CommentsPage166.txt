The fit is nothing like it fits in the picture. The dress is short and is more of a bodycon fit than a flowy dress. I'm having the HARDEST time trying to return it with a free return. I contacted the company to return it and they are telling me that I have to pay for shipping. Do yourself a favor and don't order this if you want it to fit like it does in the picture. I've seen it on someone else in person and it didn't look good on her either. And, you'll have a difficult time returning it for free.
