Super super cute great fit and price was amazing


Very pretty; fits slightly longer than expected, and a little roomier than expected. Material definitely holds you in. Beautiful dress. cant wait to wear it on vacation.


It's fitted, which I like for this, but if you want it looser order a size up. Sexy. You can wear off the shoulder or on. Material is not my fave, but awesome dress for the price.


I love this dress, I may order more it fit perfectly I got tons of compliments on it. Looks just like the picture. It fitted so nicely I did not even have to worry about the girls if you know what I mean and I am not tiny up top by any stretch. Do not think twice on this one it is worth what you will spend.


returned and refund due.  it is 5 Stars for beautiful dress. BUT it is too large for me. thanks.


This one of my best online purchase. It fit me greatly. Very nice and perfect for Summer.


This dress is everything and i love everything about it! I will def be ordering more! It’s rather long or I’m just super short lol I’m 5’4, I wear a 13/14 and I’m a size 40DDD so i ordered a LRG and it’s the prefect fit! I couldn’t be happier!


I love the dress and the fact that it was very long like I wanted it to be, the material is very thick  it's comfortable you won't be hot with it on. the only bad thing is it doesn't stay on your shoulders you have to constantly keep pulling it back down on your shoulders.


More bang for your buck! It fits beautifully and is true to size. I'm 5'6 and 185lbs I got a size large and it fits like a glove without being to tight or to loose. The length is just right to wear heels or a nice pair of sandles, can't wait to wear to Florida in October. I will definitely buy from this company again, hope this was helpful!


One star because it runs very small
