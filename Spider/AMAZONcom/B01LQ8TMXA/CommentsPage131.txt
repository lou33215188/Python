Fits as expected, no complaints. Wore this dress for a maternity photo shoot. The colors were very vibrant.


I LOVE this dress. It fits perfectly on me, I ordered an XL and usually wear a large or XL


it fit as I expected a little tight because I figured that it would run smaller because they don't consider the our hips and derriere.

Fits amazing true to size I'm curvy 5'1 150 pounds waist 28 breast 36 DD and m√©dium fit perfect


It was a nice dress it's looked great on. However, I found it to be a little to big and I personally did not care for the material too much.
