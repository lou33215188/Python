I did not like it on me.  But a very pretty print.


ğŸ’ŸğŸ˜˜ğŸ’ŸğŸ˜˜ Love.... Definitely a vacay dress.


My wife loves it


Beautiful colors. Wore to Easter service my the beach. Body hugging and spanks needed if you are self conscious and do not want panty lines, but material is just the right thickness that it's not too hot. Perfect for resort dinner and dancing.


Beautiful but a little long.  Get a smaller size than what you are actually.  It was perfect for my Caribbean cruise.


I felt all eyes on me that day...It fits like a glove...love, love it.


Very cute dress but was too small so I had to send it back. Never got a chance to wear it.


This dress fits true to size and is beautiful  I am 5'8" though, and it almost touches the ground, so warning for any petite, shorter ladies, it will be long.  Beautiful material and colors.  I have received compliments on it everywhere I wear it.


This dress went way beyond my expectations! I wore it to a dance. Itâ€™s super comfortable and I stayed cool all night while I danced. The material is very breathable. Iâ€™m 5â€™9â€� and 155 lbs and I ordered a size medium. I love love love this dress! I received a ton of compliments.
