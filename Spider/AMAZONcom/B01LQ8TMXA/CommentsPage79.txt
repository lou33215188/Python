Beautiful dress. Great quality. Wore it to a beach wedding and got many compliments. I’m 5’2 and it was a little long to wear with flats.


The material and fit of the dress were as expected. Good quality dress. The only thing is I'm 5'0ft and the dress is long so I'll have to get it hemmed a little, but I already expected that prior to my purchase. Definitely recommend.


Fits nicely, gorgeous print!

I'm 5'9 and it did not hit my ankle


Love my dress


This dress is to die for


The first dress I ordered - the white one with flowers was beautiful and fit well - hugging my curves and complimenting my short curvy body.  However on the front of the dress was a "XL" written with some kind of marker.  WTF?! Who writes the size on the dress? On the front of a white dress no less. Returned it and bought the blue one with vintage flowers - I thought the darker color would work better for wearing shape wear underneath.  The dress came in and had the wrong pattern - a mint green with pink giraffe stripes. Booooo!  Frustrated and really bummed - now I won't have my dress in time for my birthday.  I will attempt to order it one last time, third times a charm??
