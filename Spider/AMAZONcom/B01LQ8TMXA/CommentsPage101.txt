I would like to return.  When I decided to wear this dress ine underarm sleeve is sewn smaller than the other.  Please help me with this matter


I love this.


This dress fit like a glove and was amazing!! Husband loved it! V


This was very comfortable and super cute on.


Such a pretty dress! Perfect for tropical vacations! I'm 5'6" and got a large and it was a little long but would be better with a wedge heel or something cute!


Great dress! Tons of compliments! I ordered an extra large. Iâ€™m 5â€™2 and 36ddd


Great


I am so happy I bought this dress ! Love it.. fits perfect ğŸ˜�


Sexy and beyond!! It was long on me (5'3) but with some heels or wedges it was perfect.


The sz was perfect! The material and design was right on point. I bought this dress for my trip to Puerto Rico in July. Can't wait to wear it!!
