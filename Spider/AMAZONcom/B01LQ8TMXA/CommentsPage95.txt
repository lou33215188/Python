Runs too small!!


Fits, alteration necessary for specific fitting in dress/length. Fitting is what I expected anyway. Great for Summer, hot days/evening, hotel pool lounge, weekend bag.


Love the dress fits well I'm 5'11 dress is long like I wanted! Can't wait to wear it this weeekend! The colors are nice just not as bright as pictured!


Beautiful dress well made just very long.


I love this dress. I am 5'10 and it was long enough. Fits so nicely and love the pattern. Looks amazing on. I needed a cute, long maxi for Hawaii. This is it! Now going to order more patterns in this style. If you are tall, get an XL for the length.


Beautiful


I should have ordered the large but I will rock the XL comfortably.


Returned very cute but I am 5'3 and 135-137lbs and it fir good but I am so short it was to long but loved it.


So pretty. I wear a 12 or 13 in jeans. I'm a 34DDD, size medium/large shirt. I ordered a large and it fit just right. I was hesitant but glad it wasn't too big. ğŸ˜�  It definitely hugs you. I will be ordering more for an upcoming cruise.


Looks great on curvy women
