The dress is as described but when it stretches the pattern turns to a white color. Which does not look as nice. Over all nice dress just order your correct size.


This Dress is beautiful. The color and the fit were both perfect. I would definitely recommend to anyone. Im going to order it in another color as well.


Still giving of 5 stars but I'll have to take 4 inches off. I'm 5'5" and its pretty long.


Im 5'4 and weight about 200 lbs, im bottom heavy, took this dress PR for bachlorette party weekend. I just had a baby, was feeling a little self conscious but not after wearing this dress! I loved the fresh material. Im going to purchase more patterns as it was very figure flattering and great quality. Def recommend.


really like the material


Everyone and Absolutely Loved this DressğŸ’‹


I wore this dress to a wedding and it was a hit!!! Fits perfectly (5'5" 130pounds and busty. ordered a medium). The colors are vibrant and it's super comfortable. The fabric is almost swimsuit-like which ended up being perfect as we ended up dancing in the rain!!! Love this dress!


This dress is really nice the material doesn't feel cheap I ordered a small and it fits good minus the fact the it's long and it touches the floor I'm  5'4 and weight 135 pounds it hugs your body just right only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because it's flare at the bottom but it's an ugly flare I added a pic that you can't tell the ugly flare because I'm barefooted Overall the dress is wearable and really nice bright colors


Love my new dress it was a great price. Never can have too many dresses


This dress is beautiful and the material is great quality. I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments! While at the wedding, a woman spilled her drink (which was red) and of course with my luck it went straight down the side of my dress! I was so upset until i looked down and saw NOTHING on my dress! The liquid rolled right down (onto my foot) leaving NO stains!


Sizing: I'm 5'2 around 200lbs. I ordered a XL and it fit very nicely, not too tight.
