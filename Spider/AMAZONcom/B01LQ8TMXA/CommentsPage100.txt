Runs extra small!


Very flattering in creating an hourglass look.


I am 5ft 10inch 195 lbs I bought a large in this dress and it fits perfectly. The length is perfect. I love it


Love, love this dress. I hit me in all the right places.


I love this dress. I will order more. Fits true to size.


Very nice dress but the top of the dress fits a little funny (for me ) because of the little sleeve straps. So I just tuck them in.


I purchased two other dresses in the same size and this is the only one that had the length I needed and wanted. Strange that the other dresses were significantly shorter than this one. But I love this navy blue and white dress!


Cute dress but to tight around the middle.


Love he way it looks. just need heels because im 5'2 amd its long


Beautiful Maxi Dress - the colors are outstanding.
