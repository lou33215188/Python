Love this beautiful Dress. I'm 170lbs andn 5'6.5". B cup in bras and very curvy in the hips and butt. I ordered a medium and it fit very well. There's a zipper on the side which makes it easier to get in. I actually didn't discover the zipper until after I got in it. Love it tho!


Very cute dress! I wore it during #curvycon fashion week in New York and it was a hit!


I bought a large but looking at reviews and size chart I ordered large. I usually order xl- but it fits great!! Streatchy material and I love the dress. Heavy material like in a swimsuit or a little thicker. I just need to firm up my stomach as it does show that off.


Dress fit perfect...very cute on.


very cute


The material is really cheap


It's a little snug around the middle, but still looks pretty good on.


I bought this for a Hawaiian-themed party and it was perfect. Nice material and very comfortable. I purchased Large  (for top coverage) and at first thought it would be too long for flat sandals but it all worked out. Very beautiful dress and I received loads of compliments.


This is not an outfit for someone with hips!  Very unflattering.


The product was a little larger than I had expected. I was expecting to be tighter on my stomach to show off some curves on my hips and it was slightly loose. I did like the material and how it fell on my shoulders. I would buy again. Was lightweight to use and was happy to wear even on a hot day.
