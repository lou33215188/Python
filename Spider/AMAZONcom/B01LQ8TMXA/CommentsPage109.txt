Not true to size, runs very small.....I wear a small ordered medium because of previous reviews, returned and ordered a large..beautiful dress.  You need to use real models and sorry CHINESE MODELS DOES"NT COUNT!!!


The fit of the dress is amazing!!!!! The material is good especially for the price paid!!!!! The material pulls a little near the zipper but your arm covers it.


Great dress! Fits great! Flattering.
