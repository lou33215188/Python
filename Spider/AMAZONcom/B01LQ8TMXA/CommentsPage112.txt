Very tight fitting and Looks close to what is in the picture but not exact.


Love


Love the dress just a little long but I am short. So  I can't wear flats with it.


I wear a size 12 so I ordered a L... itâ€™s a lil big/loose so I would advise to go down a size but over all the dress is nice...


Love the fit, length, and feel.


The quality is very good, but I wish there were larger sizes! It's just too small.


Awesome... I love it. Definately using it to my Hawaii trip


Well looking at the picture I ordered the tropical print with the white background. It is the same print but looking at the picture it flares from the waist, not the product I received. Mine was like all the other prints which has more of a mermaid fit. I took one look at it and knew this wasn't the fit for me.


Beautiful dress ğŸ‘— I just which the material was different.


It wasn't as pretty as the picture.


The colors we're bright but not like the picture, more like a different shade of bright.


I'm probably going to return the item.
