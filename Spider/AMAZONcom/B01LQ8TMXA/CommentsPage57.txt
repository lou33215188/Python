I want this dress in every color. SO flattering especially if you have curves and big boobs!


Looks great strong fabric


The material is a thin than I expected  I got a large


I loved this dress but it was way too long even with 4 inch heels. I am 5'2.


Perfect fit! Material is thick not see through at all. Dress is beautiful.


I wear a size 10 in dresses and ordered a medium as I wanted it to clinge to my body. Wore it to a wedding and I got tons of compliments from the non-haters. Lol! Love the dress and you canâ€™t bear that price!


Awful. Look like a cartoon character in it


I liked the fit and the style, however the fabric was very polyestery ( its not a word but it fits the description).  Im returning


Love it so pretty good quailty and great price So many compliments!!! Buy it you won't regret it!!!


I'm 5'10, survey, 190 lbs ordered Large fits perfectly. Hugs all the right areas!
