Luv this dress,Fits perfect.


This dress cannot be best for the money! Thick fabric and good quality. Great for curvy women. Iâ€™m usually a size 8 and medium for great, maybe an inch too big in waist but Iâ€™m big chested so it worked out great.


Fit well and looks nice.


This dress is beautiful and well made for the price. It fit me just like the model in the photo. I'm 5'7" 140 lbs - I ordered medium. I highly recommend!


Fit great! Looked really pretty on too! Will purchase from this seller again.


Body fits ok but way too long. Will drag even with heel/wedge. I'm 5'3


Im 5'7 120lbs and got a small. It's good quality but the best part is that its long enough


Cheap fabric but cute


Super cute dress. Very comfortable. Fits as expected


The dress came in a nicely sealed package. I pulled it out and the material was as expected with great bold colors. The dress had a smell to it like apple cider vinegar but I am washing the dress first anyway to see how it handles in a washer. I can wait to step out in this dress
