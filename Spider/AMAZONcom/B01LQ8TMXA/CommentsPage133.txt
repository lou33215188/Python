I absolutely love this dress! I am 145lbs and 5'3 and i ordered a medium. It fit perfectly and the material is very nice.


Love it


Took the place of a Hawaiian muumuu.. loved wearing it to a polynesian event.  Thank you!


I loved this dress I just need to shorten it. I'm about 5'2 so its just too long but I love it.


Not a big fan of the material but the item is exactly how it’s depicted  in the photo


Love my dress


The color that I ordered was black and white. But the color is actually navy and white. I didn't return it because I still liked the dress.


I love this dress! It was well made and the material was thicker than I had expected.If you want a dress to accentuate your curves,it does just that


The quality of the fabric wasn’t as expected.  Could see thru the material.  Returned the dress.


Love the dress
