Looks better in the picture.  When material is stretched over bust it becomes faded.  Not impressed with the fabric but generally it has a ice look.


Beautiful dress, I got so many compliments wearing it.


Beautiful!!! I love this dress. I ordered a small and  I'm a size 6. It fits great. Cannot wait to wear this on my trip next month.


So beautiful. True to size. I've had amazon for over 4 years and never left a comment until now. Wow this dress was so perfect.


The dress is Lycra so if it's the least bit tight, it shows through white.


How is this dress only $23?! It was perfect!!!! Great comfy material. I'm 5'6" and typically wear a small, I ordered a medium because I'm 24 wks pregnant and the fit was absolutely perfect. The material was stretchy and perfect for a summer wedding.


Love this dress! I'm 5'8 and 197lbs. Ordered a xl but lg would have worked. Wore it to Miami and loved it.


I'd give it five stars if the material was thinner.


I bought this for a recent trip to Miami, it fit perfectly and felt great in it. For size reference I'm very pear-shaped... like a 12 top 14/16 bottom and bought an XL. My only slight dislike is the fabric, it's semi-heavy and I was pretty hot in this. But for the price and the fit, I'll deal with it :) Seriously, get this dress


nice summer dress. Fit perfectly. Love the colors
