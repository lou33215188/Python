I loved the fit. I have LOTS of HIP action and this fit PERFECTLY!! I will order again.


I'm 5'5, 143 lbs. I feel like normally I'd get a medium, but I chose to get a large because of reviews saying it runs small. It was rather long on me, but not too bad. A medium would've been skin tight on me. Love the dress! Lots of compliments.


OBSESSED! I love how you can play with the sleeves/ arm holes and go over, under, or one shoulder. It's form fitting and good material. I cant wait to wear it out to dinner when I go to Maui next week.


I get sooo many compliments!!!


Curvy ladies this is for you! I was a hit when I rocked this dress. Everyone will look and stare.. so be ready. It hugged my curves and my booty was pooping in this. I'm 5'7" and wear a size 10, maybe a 12 in the winter. I totally recommend this dress. YOU WILL LOOK AMAZING!!!


Wore this for a luau party. Needless to say, all eyes on me ğŸ˜€


Soooo cute I luv it good material .. I'm 5'6 it touches the floor that's a plus and I'm a size 16 plus


PLEASE!!! FIT PERFECT..VERY GOOD FABRIC


Absolutely loved this dress, ordered for my baby shower, I wanted something light and cute and it's exactly what I got! I ordered a large the material was nice and stretchy, colors are vibrant, and long. I'm about 5'7 180 pregnant.


Great looking dress. Material is nice and stretchy. Very long which is good because I can 5'8". Got the medium.
