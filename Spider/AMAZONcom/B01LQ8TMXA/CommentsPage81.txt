Fit as expected, can't wait to wear it on my cruise next month!!!


Very surprised by the fur and look of dress. Fit exactly how I wanted it to and it was long enough for me, 5'7.


I love it! Very pleased with my purchase


I'm 5"7" 164lbs and the small fits perfect! I. Ordered the medium at first because I thought it may run small but it was noticeable too big so I returned it and got a small. Hugs my curves and accentuates my small waist!


Love thus dress. But I'm 5 feet. Is way too long. It will cost me more money to get it alter.  Beautiful dress.


I loved this dress so comfortable. I was reading the reviews and saw that the dress was fitted I'm usually a size M but got a L because i was afraid that a M wasn't going to fit. But it did stretch alot. oh and its also super long for us short people lol I'm 5'3. I got it tailored.


beautiful dress. looks exactly like the pic... love it


I bought this dress for an upcoming vacation and I love it! The only problem I have is that it's a little big on me. I wish they offered an extra small size, but the small is okay. I'm 5'4 and 115 lbs. Other than that, this dress is great quality for the price!


lots of compliments


I love this dress so much , i wore it for my daughter bridal shower and got so many comments . It made me look sexy and young looking . I will order another one different color but same style . If u want to look pretty that is one!
