Awesome fit!


It's a great dress but too long Iam 5"5


I love the look of this dress. I'm 5'8ish 240 lbs. I ordered an XL. This dress looks LIKE MAGIC. I CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR IT IN CABO ON THE BEACH. I NEED IT IN 2 MORE COLORS!!


Sent me wrong dress and wrong size. Material was very thick. And extremely long.


Stretchy thick material. 5,6 110 small fits perfect. Like the option on the blue dress to hang off shoulders or not.


Love this dress, but a little tight on me.(not the fault of the dress!) Very well made and beautiful. So many compliments, if you purchase this you won't be disappointed.


Purchased this dress for a gala event and it was perfect! Very elegant and fit well. I did wear spanx underneath because the fabric was very form fitting. I am 5'8", 150lbs and a medium fit great.


Love this dress ok my curves. This dress is perfect for my Miami vacation.


Love the material! I brought black but it came in navy blue, which was okay to me! Fits very well to my curves! I am a medium or large in shirts but a 14 in pants and this dress fit all areas perfectly and super comfy!


Perfect fit!! I got a large and it complimented my body exactly like I wanted it too!!
