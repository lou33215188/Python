I'm 5'10 and weigh 250lbs. I ordered an XL and this dress is by far my best purchase! Material is stretchy and made of good thick material. I can't wait to wear it for my 7 day cruise!


Love it size x-large weight 185 hopes this help


7 pictures below: These dresses are the bomb (yes I'm dating myself lol).  They are long, have very thick material for a maxi dress, the print is beautiful, and it fits like a dream. I have a little stomach and I still don't even mind it because I feel very cute in this dress LOL. It is a little long but nothing I can't handle. And tgey came a week earlier than expected and I ordered three different dresses. Love it !


Love love the dress! Excellent purchase!!


Love this dress! Wore on vacation! So many compliments!!!


This dress was absolutely stunning to wear this past Easter(2017).. I received sooo many compliments. I'm usually a size 16 and I ordered the XL. Nice strength material and for all the ladies that have a pudge,, all u need is a panty girdle. I will upload a pic as well...


Oh yeah, I went back and ordered all the other patterns even those patterns I'm skeptical of because of how comfortable and great the fit was.


Hope this review helps!


I got this dress for a Hawaiian party but also wanted something to wear around for fall . This is next bodycon type of material if you don't want a snug fit go up a size . I am size 6 woman's and the small fits bodycon style which I like . I am very curvy and it hugs in a flattering way . I am also 34d and I love how this evens my heavy chest . It is long I am 5"3 but you have the ability to pull it up ruffled on the torso area . The material is medium in thickness not too light not too heavy . It is not sheer which is great for the price ! Please see photos for more details ! I hope this helps you .


This dress is such a steal for the price. I ordered an XL and my size is 36-33-47 and I'm '5"8. It still hit the floor and I'm not wearing shoes in the pic. Perfect for a summer vacay. Love love LOVE!


I wear a medium to large normally and a size small fit perfectly; so I would say it runs a size up than what you're used to. It is a little long, but I was able to pull it up some, but you may have to take it up if you know someone who does alterations.


But other than that, I love this dress! Received compliments all day! And you really can't beat the price ğŸ˜„


This dress has stretch and is curve hugging. I am 5'1 38dd and 170 lbs. I took this dress with me in my trip to Cuba and loooooovvved it!! Definitely a winner , a little long on me but not too long that I couldn't move around.
