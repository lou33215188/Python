Great material! Itâ€™s too long for me though


I get so many compliments on this dress. Please note, the material isn't cotton, it's a little heavier like a stretchy polyester but it doesn't look cheap. I'm a size 14 and this fit perfectly.


Nice fit band style


Very cheaply made


Absolutely love this dress. I bought the same dress in a different color. Shows my shape and you can either wear it dressy or casual.


Beautiful fit I ordered xl and usually wear size 16 fits like a glove the floor length is perfect with or without heels and I'm 5'5"


Loved the dress! Fit great. Price and quality of dress were great.


too tight fitting.


Decent quality, all polyester. XL didn't fit size 14.


Very form fitting
