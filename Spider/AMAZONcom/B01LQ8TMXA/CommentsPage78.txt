Beautiful and  long. I got size L because I'm pregnant.


The dress quality is good, the fabric is vibrant as pictured, the length was a bit long but I was able to scrunch it around the waist and hand no issues! The dress hugged my curves well. I ordered a large - 5'5 170 lbs 36DD - fit perfectly! Received multiple compliments.


fits well. very flattering. my fiance loves it.


BEAUTIFUL!


I love this dress.I ordered a medium. I am 180lbs. The dress was beautiful in person, the colors are vibrant. The dress did not look cheap.


Love this dress!!! I have gotten so many compliments on this dress. The color and fabric is amazing


I love this dress.  It fits right and it is beautiful!


Good


The white is completely see through! Do not buy that one. I also removed a star because it fit very snug. I bought a medium. I'm 5'5 137 lbs. the material is very comfortable, so I wish the dress fit properly and you didn't see my underwear! I'll be returning.


Perfect fit, colours are perfect, its just as the picture.
