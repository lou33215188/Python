Nice dress but runs super small.


Beautiful dress


Love it ğŸ˜�


I bought this dress for our family Christmas party with a luau theme.  Love it!!  Great dress for a great price!


I'm a medium, gota medium, and first super well. I wouldn't mind going down a size either. i am 5'4" and weight 160 pounds. I'll attach a photo for you gals x


Beautiful dress. Used it for my baby shower! Everyone complimented how beautiful it was. Love the material and it fit so perfectly! Would love to order more when I'm back to my normal size!


Cute dress but it fits like nylon material smaller than expected


I gave it 4 stars  only because it is too long,  the length is for a 5'10 ht, I'm 5'7 and it is dragging on the floor.  Otherwise the dress fits nice and is cute,  they need to make it in different length,  I think the  average is  woman is 5'6,  definitely not 5'10.  i will post a picture when i wear it out.  I need to get it hemmed up


This dress fit like a dream. The color, the style and the length all complimented each other well. A couple of friends have already ordered the dresses as well, I'm excited to see how they look on them. Great Dress only forwarded it is a thick material dress so it may be a little to hot for 100 degree weather but great in upper 80's.


to small
