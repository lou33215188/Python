I love this dress..


I love the fit. beautiful dress


Very cute dress!  I would def suggest buying!


Go 1 or 2 sizes up!!  If you like it very snug, then order your size. I ordered two. One for my daughter and I.  Love it!!


This is a beautiful dress. I ordered a large because I was afraid of how it would fit and the large is a little to big. But the dead is still wonderful.


I love this dress! Haven't got to wear it yet but tried it on and it looks great! The material is thick and feels really good! Love it! Can't wait to wear it on vacation!


Love the fit it's perfect


Looked fantastic when I wore it and was very comfortable


Nice❤️
