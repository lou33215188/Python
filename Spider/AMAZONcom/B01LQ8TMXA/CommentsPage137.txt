Excellent fit...will be ordering more colors


Much too long and I'm 5'4" and wear 3 in heel


Good quality material.


The dress is nice however I could not wear it for the occasion because it has a big orange stain on it


This dress is beautiful. The material is not flimsy and it fit so well.


Love this dress.


I get compliments EVERY TIME I WEAR IT! It's awesome and flattering!


Love the material, colors and the patterns on dress.


Love It.


Beautiful dress, fabric is good, just long for me, not really large.
