Pretty fabric but the fit is super tight. You'll have to be super slim ( and I'm slim) to wear this and not worry about anything showing.


 I love this dress! Great material and form fitting. Very colorful and looks great on. I'm 210 lbs and 5'7 (bottom heavy) and ordered at XL. It wasn't too long for me either. I Just gave birth so I didn't want to have anything too tight on my stomach and this size fits me perfectly. Got some compliments on it and hubby loved it. It's a steal for the price. Get it!


material very thick not for hot climate weathers also it has a lining which makes it extra hot and it keeps sliding up . not happy not a good buy


This hugs your body. It would have been great if I was pregnant but I do have a little belly so I had to pose myself to hide it but overall it was great!


I dress made me feel sexy !


Love this dress. Wore it recently on a cruise.Fits perfect. Super stretchy for curvy girls. True to size....


This Dress was everything! Recently went on a Cruise and wore this dress.I received so many compliments. I will defienlty be buying other colors! This Dress is Sexy, Comfortable and will make your Curves POP!! If you plan to stop shows, and break necks..This is the one!! ğŸ’‹


Its perfect. I'm 6ft tall about 230 pounds and it hugs EVERY SINGLE CURVE on my body. Definitely buying from them again.


Absolutely love this dress! I am 5'7, 180 lbs, 40 DD and I ordered a XL and it fit perfectly. I got so many compliments when I wore it and I felt fabulous. The quality of the dress is good and the colors of the dress are just as vibrant as the picture shows. The dress is long and I have to wear heels so I won't step on the dress but I love it. Now I want this dress in every print lol


After reading the lastest reviews before ordering. I got the impression the dress was ideal for tall women. I'm 6ft tall. I ordered an XL hoping for a longer length. Not because I wear an XL because I don't. The dress is too short. I like my maxi dresses at ground length or longer. Otherwise it's not a maxi dress. I'm sending it back
