Just right


Came too large.  Does not hug my curbs. I will be returning this item.


great stretchy material I bought a size Medium perfect fit only issue I had was that it runs long I am 5'2 but other than that I am happy with the quality of the dress.


It made well.


Too Large


I love it!! I'm 5'9 and "thick" but medium fit me perfect and the length was just right. It was barely hitting the floor. Will be purchasing more!


Just received this and like the reviews say.. it is amazing.. very figure flattering, well made, comfortable.  Taking it on my Mexican vacay in 2 days.  I am 5 8" 185.  I purchased the XL because I didn't want it too snug but probably could have done a large.


Did not like this dress, made with low budget material. I would give it 0 stars but I have to choose one


I know you can only see the top but trust me when I say the dress was on point!!!!!


The style is flattering but it gets distorted (lighter in color from the rest of the dress) when it's stretched over your curves.
