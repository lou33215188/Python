I adore this dress! Perfect for tropical vacation


I'm 5'6 and I wear a size 10/12. Based off the reviews, I purchased the Size: Large | Color: 61189-1 Print and this dress really is a tight fit. The print is gorgeous and the dress length stops below my ankles. Ladies this dress is tight so if you want to order a size up feel free to do it. I'm getting my summer wardrobe together and this dress is definitely a part of it. Although the fit is snug, it's a sexy kind of snug and if you wear a thin stomach helper it does not show through the fabric. The material has a stretchy feel to it and it is breathable. I'm pleased with my purchase and I look forward to purchasing a different print. This dress was made for thick, shapely, and curvy girls! I appreciate you for taking time out to read my review. I hope you found it informative.


I am extremely happy I bought this dress.  The silhouette is perfect and fits most body types. The material hugs you in all the right places and is of good quality. I saw some reviews that said it was thin, but honestly I wore it in the night so I can't say and because the pattern was floral I don't think it would show that much anyway. I also wore it with flat sandals but I could also wear it with heels. I'm 5'5 and 149lbs and ordered a medium.  I will be ordering one more dress from this seller.  One of my favorite purchases on Amazon.  ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼


I am obsessed! It is so cute and comfy. I purchased a large.


I purchased this for my upcoming Jul 16 baby shower. I am entering my 3rd trimester at 156-160 lbs, 5ft (of course this covers my feet-short ppl problems! i am getting it hemmed because I will be wearing flats...if I were to wear heels/wedges, length wouldn't be an issue) and I wanted to buy this while it was still in stock, but it's a stretchy material and I have no doubt it'll still fit the belly in a month! I'll wear this even after the baby and get other styles. Money well spent. Hope this helped another short or pregnant lady :)!


Only con: I was wearing white cheeky underwear while trying this on and can see it through the back where no flowers are covering right at the small of my back and a little further on the butt. Easy fix though with a slip or thong even, but to be expected with a white item.


Material is stretchy but not cheap feeling. Great print and cut. The color and style is true to the pictures! Iâ€™m 5â€™10, 150lbs and 34ddd, and I ordered a medium. Itâ€™s a little snug, but not too uncomfortable. Iâ€™m ordering a large in another print just to compare because I would like it a little looser. The cut and material will still allow the dress to hug my body and curves, but not skin tight. Itâ€™s also a little shorter than I wanted it to be. I couldnâ€™t wear heels with this one, but a pair of cute flats would be perfect. Great for formal events in the summer!


Perfect fit! Many compliments! I'm 5'9" and thick but it fit exactly the way i hoped it would. Great buy!


Absolutely love this dress. Fits well, cradles my curves nicely. I'm 5'4" about 185lbs and bout the large. Could have gotten the Medium but will keep the large. It's long but I expected that. May have it shortened. I normally wear a size Medium and a 10 in clothes. Hope this helps. My husband lovessss it.


I ordered this dress for a solo vacation to Greece a few months ago and I am OBSESSED. I wore it out for a date night to a fancy restaurant in Mykonos and then dancing, and again for a dinner night in Santorini, both times in flat sandals. I wore it again back home the other weekend for a polo tournament with wedge heels and the length was still just right. With flats, the dress was just barely skimmed the floor so it didn't drag; with 3" wedges it was off the floor but still past my ankles (which is a win when you're as tall as I am). I've gotten too many compliments to count. My dad is not a gloating man, and when I posted a picture of myself in this dress in Greece, he brought it to a family gathering to brag to everyone. Dad approved, sexy date approved, girlfriends loved it, this dress is so versatile and I wish it came in more prints that were less tropical so that I could buy one to wear in colder weather.


I'm 5'11" and usually wear a size 8-10, about 158 lbs. I ordered a size large and it was perfect. It fit all my curves like a glove without showing my lady lumps, and the medium weight material has the perfect amount of stretch to be comfortable. Nobody believes that this dress was so inexpensive for the high quality.


Beautiful design, great soft fabric with the perfect thickness, fits wonderfully with vibrant colors! A steal at this price, will be ordering more colors! I am about 164lbs, 5'5", 38-31-40 and I ordered a medium which fit perfectly and I definatly feel a large would have been too big on me and a lot less flattering. Hope this helps!


Based on the other reviews, I had to get it and it did not disappoint! I'm 5'2" and about 155. I usually wear a 10-12 and the Large fit perfect. Hugs and accentuates the curves...thank goodness summer finally  arrived!!
