Well it's loud and tight and that's all I can say about it.


Great fit. Arrived on time. Canâ€™t complain


I really like this dress and the sizing chart was a great help in choosing the correct size.  My only issue is the flowers look a shade of fuchsia but are actually red.  I would purchase again.


love love this dress it is so pretty on


Absolutely perfect! I bought this dress for our Anniversary Cruise. I absolutely loved wearing this! I cannot wait to wear it again. And I recieved lots of compliments!!

This dress was everything fits my curves it's a must I get another one I have 2 I'm tryna have every color ğŸ¤— I weight 175 I brought a large


Loved the dress, although having to reorder different size. Not happy with the having to wait for a refund, instead of being able to do a simple exchange.


This dress fits perfectly, very strong fabric and hugs all curves.... I strongly recommend this,,100 stars


I thought the dress was black and white. When I got it the dress was blue and sliver.. I still love the dress and the fit. Be careful because the dress is long. I am 5'3 in need to have the dress take in a little.
