I got so many compliments on this dress.


I love it!


Good Material, glad I went a size up from my normal size.


Doesnâ€™t look anything like the picture at all. Not worth the money. Extremely disappointed.


 I was going to wear it this weekend but now I have to find something else.


This dress was an absolute hit! I got it for my cruise vacation to Cuba. I just ordered another in a different pattern. I'm 5'3 about 140 and I got a medium. I would say it's long, but nothing a nice heel won't fix :)


Made a little small but I received a lot of compliments on this dress!


It's decent material but runs large and very long. I had to cut and sew so I could wear it with sandals.


Looks nice


Absolutely love this dress. Good quality material and stretch. Im 5'7 and the length is perfect. I wore this dress on vacation and recieved so many compliments.


This dress is a show stopper! wore to a county club summer wedding and received non stop compliments!
