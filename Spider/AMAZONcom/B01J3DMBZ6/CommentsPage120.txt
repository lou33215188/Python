Great look!


totally different colour


I love this dress.  i am about 5'9'' and 145 pounds.  it is about mid calf in length and though there is a slit, it is modest enough to teach in.  it is a bit shear so i will probably wear leggins with it when i work but go without one out of work.  it is rather flowy and i could have gone with an extra small but the small is fine.  i may pair it with hoops and a simple necklace that will not take away from the tie dye pattern.  i actually think this can ne a year round dress if you pair it with a leather jacket or cardigan. it is simple, sexy, chic, and classic:)


Size down.
