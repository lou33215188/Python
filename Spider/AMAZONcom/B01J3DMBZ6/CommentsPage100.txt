Soft comfy cute maxi ğŸ’™


Love the style but it's a little long if you don't wear heels.


When I received this Large it had a tiny hole in it!:(


Great dress. Hangs nicely and the fabric is very comfortable!


Really good quality material that's just heavy enough to make the dress hang perfectly.


Runs big, so order a size down. Super comfy and cute! Love the pockets!


Fits great and is flattering, got lots of complements! Was slightly larger than epected but worth it.


loved it!


Initially, I bought this dress in brown for myself. I'm 5'4, size 12 hourglass with red hair and very fair skin. The dress was SUPER SOFT and really good quality, VERY COMFORTABLE and had pockets! POCKETS! Right?! BUT.... it just didn't look great on me and kind of washed me out, was clingy in the wrong places.


However, I gave it to my mom and it looked GORGEOUS on her! I think she also ended up ordering another one in a different color. She is the same height as size as me but is more apple shaped with brown hair and tan skin. It was very slimming and flattered her complexion beautifully.


Love this dress! Made with good material and fits nicely!
