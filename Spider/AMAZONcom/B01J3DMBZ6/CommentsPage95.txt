Love this dress..I little too long..Hey but what are belts for!...love the fit and material!


I love this dress, it fits perfect with pockets,  it is a loose fit and very comfortable. The material is soft and  light.


Delightful dress, super soft fabric and lovely color, abut long for me but everything is!!


The colors are off but not too obvious. Front was lighter than the back. Way too long. Tripping. Not as roomy as the other color ordered..


My dress doesnâ€™t look like the pink tires or like the other pictures people posted in reviews. Pretty bummed.


Way too see through!!!


This dress has a very dramatic flair with the vertical stripes of yellow against the


black.  I love it!


Runs big


even the small is too large


Really unflatering...felt like a nighgown.
