Had stains on it when I got it!


This dress is great! Got a medium and it fit perfectly. I washed it and the color was perfectly fine. Would I ordered this is multiple colors, each one perfect.


Don't buy this! It is really cheap looking, it doesn't look anything like in the pictures. It has a weird smell. Returning mine.


Definite keeper! Soft, comfy, and lots of compliments.


Runs a bit large but I love how soft it is and would recommend it.


The cut is kinda off.It hangs weird. I will probably use it as a night gown.


Looks good on me!


I ordered the smallest size they had and oh BOY! I felt that I had a plastic bag :( I love this style but if you are 5'4 and weight 108 pounds its HUGE! :(


Love how this dress looks and fits but after I wore it once fabric developed a hole...  Was considering ordering another but afraid the same thing may happen.


Loved it and in fact purchased another in a different color!
