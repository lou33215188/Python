I love this dress, but the M was pretty big on me, I should have ordered a small. However, the quality was really good and its super comfortable.


Interesting!


The material of this maxi is extremely comfortable. I had to return it though because it was too long. I'm 5'1" and I didn't want to hem it shorter because I would lose a lot of the slit.


Even in a small, it's pretty large, but super cute with boots.


i'm 5'2", 110 it was about 3 " too long just hemmed it up.  I love it


I love this dress. Adorable. Runs a little big.


I love the dress. However, it does fit a little on the roomy side...


Love the color (blue) and the nature drape of the fabric.


Love the fabric but itâ€™s a bit stretchy. love the pockets but they do make your hips look bigger, some may appiciate that. Looked funny on me. Was too long though and the fabric was a bit heavy and weight down and dragged.


Very comfortable sundress.  I loved the tie dye design and the slits on the side.  I wore this to a sundress party and I felt like was very unique in what I was wearing, I received lots of compliments.  I also had similar shoes like the model pictured so it paired perfectly!
