I guess I didn't read the description well enough.  I don't like the clingy material it is made of.  Probably will only wear it around home.  I was disappointed.


I bought another one of these dresses because I love it so much. It is so comfortable


I read the reviews to make sure that I ordered the correct size.  Well, needless to say I still didn't order the correct size.  It does not really look how I wanted it to look. The pockets hang weird on the sides and makes me look like I have bigger hips.  I also don't like how the sleeve does not come down very far on the arm (or even how it looks in the picture).  I was hoping to take this on vacation with me so I could wear it as a lounge dress but now I am not sure that I even want it.


Love it and buying more like it! Fit as expected. If you're thinking about buying but not sure on the fit, go up one or two sizes. I purchased mine based on the comments and questions and went up two as I have a larger chest.


Excelent


I use this as a nightgown.


I purchased this last minute for a weekend road trip. Loved the fit, lots of compliments!


I'm 5'5, and wear a size 16. Ordered an XL.


I love it!


Comfortable exactly what I was hoping it would look like on me!


Soft and comfy. A little long for me but I'm 5'2" so most things are
