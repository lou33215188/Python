Need to send back way to big


It's a nice, comfortable dress for the summer. It's not tight fitting. I like that it has pockets and two splits on the sides.


Itâ€™s a comfy oversized T-shirt dress! Love the pockets and the deep v and side slits! Got tons of compliments on it


LOve! Pockets are key for me. So comfortable and stylish.


First maxi dress I've ever loved. Beyond comfortable and fits perfectly.


Nice fabric but too big and came with a hole


Is really long but I had it hemmed up.  Really nice and comfortable.


Dress has good fit but it arrived with a hole in the pocket. There is no way to exchange the product, just return it.


I love the material!! It fits amazing!!


Love it, fit is perfect and super fast shipping!!
