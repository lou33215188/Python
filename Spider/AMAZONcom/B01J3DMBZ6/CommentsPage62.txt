Very long...


The S was way too large, and usually I am a S-M. Its long and just large in general, which Isn't really a bad thing, but I didn't want to have to wear heels with it all the time.


The matirial is so great ...so soft ğŸ˜�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸� If you want it a bit tight order one size down  other than that I'm so in love


Pros:


The material is nice and feels good on your skin.


Cons:


Seemed too large, even for a maxi dress.


It was also very long, so I will probably just wear this around the house for fear of tripping outside or getting the bottom all dirty


I LOVE this dress. It's soft, comfy, and perfect for me to dress up post surgery.


Love this maxi! I would suggest to either purchase true to size or size down, depends on how you flowy you would like the maxi. I am 5 ft 2 in and bought XS. Great maxi for the summer!


I really wanted to like this dress! The pattern and material were great but the dress was sown incorrectly and hangs off center to the side. Really bummed. This is the second dress I have had to return from this seller. I won't be buying any others.


Very soft and comfortable. Much too long for a 5'4" Size Large. I have to knot it on the side, which is okay--looks rather stylish that way.

Glad with this dress! Very comfy! Bought 1 size down - fit perfect! Ordered more colors. Ordered M, I'm 5.2" and 139 pounds.


Very comfy.
