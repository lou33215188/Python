Fabric is horrible nothing like the pic :/


I get compliments on this dress constantly. I wear it all the time it is the most comfortable dress I own! Great dress, great price!


Awesome dress.  Light and perfect for summer.


Dress is just as pictured! Beautiful color and quality! I’m 5’2” so the length is a bit long on me, but I’ll just get it fixed! Can’t wait to wear this cute dress!!


Beautiful dress! Bought the blue one & it looks just as the images do. I am typically a size S, but had ordered an XS considering the other reviews I had read. I am glad I ordered a size down because it is very big but very soft & comfortable. It's a keeper!


I haven't washed it as of yet, but I purchased it as a 'slip into something comfortable' option when we're back for the evening while traveling. So far, I like it very much.


I returned this because the bottom of the dress was cut so uneven it looked incredibly odd.


Super comfy dress.


It is a little long, but I tie the bottom in a little knot and wear it with flip flops and it's just as cute.


This dress is fantastic. The only thing is it IS a bit sheer so you might want to wear a liner if you're concerned about that. It would be great as a cover-up or worn on its own on a hot day.
