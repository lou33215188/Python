Cute casual dress.


Comfortable dress, soft material, a little more casual than expected


Dress is too long. Pockets are very low


eeeeew


Really like the dress...very comfortable.


Little long


Cute but thin material...it's kind of see-thru. Will probably have to wear a long slip under it.


I did send it back it did not fit nice  at  all for me.


Love this dress. So comfortable. Fits well. I am a size 14/16 so I like that it hides my bulges!


Love the material and the design. Super comfy
