Love this dress!  Pretty, light weight, soft, comfortable...what more could you ask for?


Fabric was see through, and the size large was dragging on the floor, it's way too long. I'm 5'4". I returned it.


I really like the color and style of this dress but it was too long for my preferred footwear (wanted to wear a fun, casual flip flop with it.) I'm 5'6".


runs big otherwise ok


Love the feel of the fabric and how it hangs on my body. It's a bit larger than expected. I'm 5'8" and 153 lbs. and bought a small and it's a little big/long. But with a belt and tying a knot in the front and back of the bottom part of the dress it was perfect.


This dress is perfect and it fits me great. 9 months post pardom and still working some extra weight off. I thought it might be a little snug - NOPE - it's perfect. You can dress it UP or dress it down in a casual way. I love the pockets. Did I mention it's really comfortable: soft material with a little stretch! Just what I was looking for.


Fabric is stretchy/clingy and does not breathe particularly well. However, it drapes nicely around the legs.


This dress is so comfy and also stylish. Perfect for many different occasions.


I love it! So comfortable. I will purchase this again for a gift as well another color for myself!


I like it, but I am 5'2" / 128lbs and it is a bit too long.  I'll either re-hem or compensate with footwear.  Very comfy and uber-soft!
