Great material and fit! Wish that it was longer...!


Runs large. Very long. Excellent customer service as I had to exchange size twice


i really like this dress, it’s perfect for summer and a almost perfect fit. i’m 5’5 and it’s a bit long for me and it’s a tad heavy so if you’re not watching your bra might stick out for a second


See through, and was sewn crooked.


Great fit, comfy dress.  Love how the fabric feels.


BEAUTIFUL


JUST NOT THE COLOR FOR ME


really am happy with it......might have to order another one .The tough part will be deciding on which color


I loved the comfort and style of this dress and it had great reviews.  However after trying it on, I felt like the pockets added bulk to my hips which I didn't like.  It didn't work for me, but it still a really cute dress!


Returned really runs big


I love the style and fabric!
