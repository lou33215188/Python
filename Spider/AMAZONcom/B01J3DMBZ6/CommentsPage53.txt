Nice fabric. Fits great! Got an XXL for a busty size 12.


Love it. Very comfortable to wear hanging around the house, but nice enough to go out in also. Would recommend.


Love the color, fabric, fit and how it flows. I can wear it around the house all day, run errands in it.


Its tge absolute all purpose weekend dress.


I didn't read the print well enough and accidentally ordered the one with sleeves but it's still pretty cute and really comfy.


So comfortable and long enough for a 5'9 person! Added a belt around the waist to fit a little better. Still works without a belt just a drapy, loose fitting maxi :)


Very pretty and comfortable but seems to stretch out a bit. Can be dressed up or down so it is really versatile. Great for the money.


This is the perfect summer dress. I will order 3 more. Love it!


It's cute! It runs a little big and my dress didn't have nearly as much black dye on it which was a little disappointing from the picture.


I will take a star away because it's rayon and NOT cotton. I am getting tired of these mislabeled items.


very nice and comfy dress for this price. It came on time and was in perfect condition. Love it:}}}}}
