I ordered this in a medium it was to big. Sent it back for a small it fit perfectly but the pattern was missing down one whole side of the back. Returned it. Ordered another small the pattern looked great so I didn't try it on. Washed it and hung it in closet. Imagine my surprise when I went to wear it and it's 8 1/2 inches to long. Now I'm 5'6" tall so this is way to much extra material. The medium and the faulty first small were not long like this! I'm so very disappointed!


material accents all the wrong bulges in a large - also not made very well - edges not finished


Absolutely perfect dress! It fits great, it's super flattering and the material is so soft.  It's not see through and none of your business will show lol.  I seriously think this dress would look great on most, if not all, body styles. I wear a 10 (36D, size 31ish waist, 152 lbs, 5'8) in most everything, but I ordered a small based on what everyone else was saying, and it fits perfectly.


Ordered a small first - too big and then ordered an xsmall thinking it would be perfect but nope still too big.


Material is very soft, comfortable. It's a nice casual dress


Love it ! Great material & super comfy! Exactly what I wanted ! Fits loosely & long. I'm 5'8 & it's perfect


O ordered a med. and it fit kind of large and long, but is very comfortable. Will wear around house.


I purchased a medium and my dress has holes in it so that's LAME. I would exchange it for another if possible


Really soft and comfortable. I am usually a medium, but the small was perfect. However, it is too long and not easy to hem. I am 5'4", and I would have to wear tall shoes for it not to drag on the ground.
