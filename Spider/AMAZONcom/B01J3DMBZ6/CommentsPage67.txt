Really cute, nice quality for the price.


Loved the pattern and texture


So comfy.  Had to purchase another one in a different color.  Just what I needed on a hot summer day.


There is nothing negative about this dress, I love it the fit the color, made well, I would buy from this seller gladly, prompt delivery as well.


Super soft, love the deep pockets, great length. I wear size 8/10 and the medium is perfect. Will live in this all summer!


I have a few dresses like this and I love them all!  Definitely size down, runs very big.


This is the most comfortable, soft and cute dress I have this summer. Looks great and the splits on the side gives a sexy look


If you want it to hug your body, go a size down...it's a beautiful  piece


Ugly big.


Soft and  Comfortable  Color is  bright
