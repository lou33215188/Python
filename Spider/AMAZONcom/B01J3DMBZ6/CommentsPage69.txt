Soft material and super comfortable. I am 5'5", 140 lbs and a 34DDD.  Last time I ordered a large and it was a bit big.  This time I ordered a medium and it fits a little better.


Very comfortable and light weight. Love the pockets.


I love it! I am 5'6 125 and I still had to shrink the XS in the dryer. But it is very cute and comfy especially for the price.


Too long compared to the same dress in other colors. I returned.


A bit large and long, but cozy.


This is not a dress for pear shaped ladies. It just accentuates large hips and makes the rest of your body look like a tent. It's the most unflattering thing I've ever tried on. Bummer, because I see so many beautiful photos posted here, I guess you either have to be slim or have small hips for this to work. Even belted, it just looks horrible, it makes me look three sizes larger than I am. It's soft and comfy, though extremely thin, so it's a true bummer that it fits like a giant marshmallow potato sack situation.


Too long


Love this summer dress. Great quality and so cute! Looks exactly like the picture.


If you are 6 ft or taller the slits will basically show your woman parts so it's worked as a swimsuit cover up for me.


Love the material and how it fits
