I didn't like the slinky material, that material that hangs out you and shows every bump. If you're super toned get it tho!


Medium fits snug and fabric is so sheer it can only be used as a swimsuit cover-up. Buy the next size up if you want it loose and flowy.  You'll have to wear something underneath, it's very sheer.


A great summer dress! Super comfortable and flattering. It's slightly too long for me (I'm 5' 4", approx 140lb), the hem tended to brush the floor, but that was easily fixed with a belt.


Material is good. Made well. However the dress is just SO wide and big. I got a size small and it is shaped like an XL. I kept it and wear it around the house as a nightgown.


I usually a medium, after reading the reviews, I ordered a small. But it's still TOO LARGE!!!! sadly, I have to return it. nice dress, if the size would fit.


Pretty but to small didn't offer a bigger size so unless I lose weight not going to order again


This dress is super comfortable. Perfect as a beach coverup or to wear on a super hot day around the house or to run errands! The pockets do have a tendency to bulge a bit, which makes the silhouette a bit awkward/unflattering at times. But, as a bathing suit coverup or to wear while you're lounging at home, this dress is awesome for Summer!


Love this dress but I’m only 5’1” and it’s LONG. Need to get it hemmed and ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ how to??


It's a great dress, however I ordered the coffee color one and received a white /black color.  Also I believe it did come from china, so not returning.  Just a really comfortable throw on around  the  house .


Gorgeous, and flowing, very long.  My daughter wanted me to buy her one!  I have long legs, and it fits to the ankle, which is a rare find!
