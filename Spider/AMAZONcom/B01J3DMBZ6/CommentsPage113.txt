Well made and great fit. Will order again.


Love it.  Fits nice and I love the fabric.


LOVE LOVE LOVE the material is so soft


Super comfy and cute dress.


Midline of v neck is somewhat off centered


The material is quality. Easy chic.


Runs big... I'm usually a large and I got a medium, it fits nice, just a little bit big.


For the price I paid this dress was not what I expected. I am 5'4 and weigh 123lbs and ordered a small. It's more like an extra large. Not only that it was about 4 inches to long. I washed it in hot water because it said 96% cotton and it did not shrink one bit. Unless you like moo moo dresses don't order one. Also I went to have it hemmed and it had extra material on the left side that made it hang longer on that side. Would not recommend.


I ordered a size large and I wear a size16  this dress fit like a size 3x


Very nice material, comfy!! Love it!
