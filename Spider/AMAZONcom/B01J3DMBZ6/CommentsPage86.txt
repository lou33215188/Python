Love this dress! Not see through at all. I recommend going down a size, its very roomy.


Super soft fabric, and I love the pockets!


This dress is made of the most soft cotton and has pockets and I love it. It’s long enough for me and I am 5’9”


great


This dress is perfect for summer.


Love the length (tied at bottom for flats and regular for small heels) for my height (5'4")


Love the pockets.


It's thin, cool material (but not see thru)


Comfy dress


Super cute, but arrived with little holes in it everywhere. I returned it.


This dress is not at all what is pictured. The print is different and the material is weird jersey like material, not light weight/ cotton as picture shows. Returning.


Loved it and fits well. Super comfortable material. If your short like me(5'0) may be a bit long but tied it in a knot and it fit perfect. Color is fun!


Really cute and comfortable design, just the fit is kind of big so order down.
