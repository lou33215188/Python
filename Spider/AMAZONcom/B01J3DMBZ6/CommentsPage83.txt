I love this! Its comfy, soft fits perfectly. 5 4" 140 med. My only wish is that the color range was wider. I would buy more!!!


LOVE!!!!!!!!!


Dress is nice quality and comfortable stretchy fabric. But the slit was much higher than expected on my 5'4" frame.


Can't order a smaller size because it would then be tight.


cute i approve


Cool and loose. fits great.


Fabric is heavy, but definitely is not see through.


I absolutely loved the maxi


It’s a great dress but I’m pretty sure I bought a grey one and it arrived as a blue one.


I received SO many compliments when I wore this dress. I want one in every color!!!


AMAZINGLY.COMFORTABLE AND VERY STYLISH!!! The pockets are a fun plus! Dafe to order a size down and you will still have a lot of flow and comfort.
