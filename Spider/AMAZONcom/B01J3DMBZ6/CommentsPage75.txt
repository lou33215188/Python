super cute, comfy, stretchy dress.  Fits great, nice soft fabric.


Very comfy. Get several colors. Easy to dress up or lounge around in. Good purchase.


Love the stress so much I ordered another


Planning to buy it again in different color.


True fit.  True color as advertised


Cute, comfy


My dress says 95% polyester & 5% spandex. Super shiny, which I donâ€™t like. No cuffs on sleeves & no back seem or detail as advertised. Made cheap. Fits snug & not like picture. Disappointed


It's pretty clingy but I think I will keep it. I went by the size chart and it was right on.  Yeah, i'll keep it.  I like the fact that it has sleeves and not your average tank type of maxi.


I love this dress!  I am 5'5" and 180s'ish lbs. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. Very figure flattering. Love it so much, I came back and ordered another color!


Not impressed
