This dress is very cute, but it has pockets which throw off the outline of the dress, making bulges in odd places. The pocket bulges are so distracting I have never worn the dress other than to try it on.


I love this dress and it fits great! I got a medium . It will be very nice for spring and summer


Pretty grumpy dumpy looking. Totally see through as well.


Love this maxi dress. Very comfortable. Love the colour.


Great jersey dress! Comfortable lightweight fit and great print. Holds up well in wash, and has not shrunk in dryer.


Very cute dress and extremely comfortable. Something easy and stylish to wear and looks really good with a belt or without. I also love the fact that it has pockets!


Great casual dress! Fits exactly as expected - I ordered a Medium ( I'm 5'6") and its exactly how I like to wear my clothes. Its flowy and loose with still a nice shape in the neckline and shoulders. I ordered two different colors and have been living in them ever since they arrived!


More like a moomoo


Love the fabric, love the gathering at the middle back, love the flow. I want ten more for summer!


Nice, soft material. Construction well done. The print and color look just like the photos.


It's a bit long, but that's a common issue I have since I'm 5'4.
