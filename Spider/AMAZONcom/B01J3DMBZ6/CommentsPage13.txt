I am 5 3' and 160ish lbs. I ordered a large in the brown print. I love how soft the material is. It is a very comfy dress. Great to wear around house and perfect for the beach. I bought this dress and another dress with similar style from MakeMeChic for my beach vacay next week. My only complaint is that the pockets are a lil too low for my short t-rex arms, so i rated it 4 stars. I have ordered more colors of the other dress but would maybe order more in this dress to wear around house. I would recommend this dress. I bet it fits taller people with long arms perfectly.


great for a trip to Mexico! (used as a cover-up)


Love this dress. I had surgery this summer and it was perfect to slip on and have a loose material over my abdominal area. It can be used as a dress or swimwear cover. It lost a star because the pockets have already started to wear holes in them only after a few washes.


LOVE the draping & feel of this dress. For a size 6-8, still this XS a wee bit oversized. Hoping a wash & then air dry will make it a smidgeon smaller. I washed & it did not shrink, btw.


(The other, light pink I ordered based again on reviews & sizing, I went down to XS & THAT one is TOO BIG! Will review this one separately).


I've gotten compliments when wearing this dress but I'm not sure...it feels like a moo moo since the waist isn't tapered. I think it would be super cute if you add a little rope belt.


Love this dress!! I get complements on it all the time! It fit me perfectly, but I'm also 5'9" so nothing is ever really too long on me and I got an XL. The fabric is a little heavier so if it's like 90+ outside you may sweat a little, but I'd rather the material be thicker than thin and cheap feeling like some other items I've ordered in the past ğŸ™„


A little too long for me too  I'm 5'4" I think I should have got a small but I didn't want it to not be baggy


Loving this dress... im 5'6 160 36DDD and ordered a Medium... This dressis very comfy , long to my ankles and I love the v-neck... The dress feel so soft like you are wearing nothing at all.... The pattern is nice and the dress is not see through at all.... This dress gives me my shape and flows with me as i walk.. I odered 2 in different colors and happy that I did :)


I love it.  Only one problem with it, it is either too long or I am too short.  My guess is that it is the latter.  I'm 5'2" and barefoot it is about 5 inches (give or take) too long.  I haven't decided what I'm going to do about it yet, I find this type of material hard to hem, especially on a curve as this hem is.  I would actually like this in different colors too if I figure out how I'm going to adjust the length.


The dress I received was mostly white with some grey, I was expecting it to be more grey like the picture so I was disappointed right off the bat. I also ordered a size down per the reviews, but it's too small. There is also a hole in the right pocket. The material is really soft and comfortable though.
