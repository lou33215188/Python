I love the dress. It fits perfect except it is a little long. It is very comfortable and cool for summer.


Fabulous dress, cool, comfy and stylish. Def buying more colors!


Fit really well - I'm not small to begin with (broad shoulders, tall, and hips) and I'm now 14wks pregnant. I get compliments wherever I go in this!


Received this dress and it fit and looked better than I had hoped. LOVE this dress. I would tell people to order down a size. The dress is roomy but very comfortable. It's perfect for a night on the beach.


Fits perfectly and is super comfy. Received lots of compliments.


LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress.  Fabric is soft, comfy, and the quality is great.  The pockets are my favorite feature.  Will order again in another color
