I purchased size small but it was way too large & long.  I'm 5'4" tall & 130 lbs.  The dress didn't look nice either so I'm returning it.


Love this dress! Wear it to bed and out. Super comfortable and the pockets are awesome


It's very comfy & I love the pockets. It's just a bit long on me. I'm 5'6. Wear heels.


Love it, too lone, but took care of that, its just right!


The dress is made with stretchy cotton so I probably could have went down a size instead of up a size like I usually buy when I order online


I'm 5'5 220lbs and I ordered the XL. It fits great and hangs just right.


Super comfortable dress! Looks great on if you add accessories to it the dress looks even better!


Bigger than I though, but still nice. I just have to tailor it to be shorter but that's all my dresses since I'm 4'11


My favorite so far!


I usually wear a medium, should've gone with a small as it's almost too long and big.  May return for a smaller size.
