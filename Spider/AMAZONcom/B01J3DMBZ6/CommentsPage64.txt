I normally get a a medium so I got a small. It had a looser fit which I wanted ( I wanted it to fit like the photo). it was soft and comfy and was long so it didn't hit at an awkward length like most do (I'm 5'9).


Wore this my entire pregnancy- Amazing!!!


order a size smaller!


Sheer! I have to return it as is see-through and not wearable unless as a beach cover-up


This dress is comfortable and easy to wear.


Nice and light. Fits well. Arrived fast. I love it!


I love the material and the sizes run a little large but I don't mind because they sit nicely on your curves


This will be great in the summer!


not a shapely dress, but super comfy, great color, soft fabric... slightly large, not overly so. i'll definitely wear this dress a lot.


UGH I'm going to live in this dress this summer. It's SO cute, soft, and comfortable! I will say that it DEFINITELY runs large - I'm a true large (curvy, 5'4 size 10) and even the medium is a hair big on me. The length is good though, not too long. I think I'll be purchasing in other colors, this dress is everything.
