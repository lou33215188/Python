Somewhat small but oh so comfortable material


Didn't like this at all. Sooo big even the small.


better than being too small


Runs big


Nice dress just a little too big. I normally wear a medium or large and even checked the measurements provided, but if I order again I will choose XS.


Love it fits just right i'm 215 in weight  got a  extra large can wait for the weather to change highly  recommend


Wow! Love this dress will be getting a couple more  super  soft  and food weight to the material and not paper thin verry happy


Love this dress. It is a bit long on me but overall I love it. I'm 5'2" and the dress touches the floor about an 1-2 inches so I need to wear a slight heel


booght this dress for my wife, it is beatiful!


Fit's as expected.  Kind of cute, but the pattern wasn't my style.
