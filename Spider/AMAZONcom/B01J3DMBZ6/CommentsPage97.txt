Very long! I'm 5'8" and the large was touching the ground.


LOVE this dress! I am 5'2" and about 170 lbs. I ordered the medium, and it fits really well. It's definitely too long on me, but if paired with wedges, it will be just fine! Highly recommend.


It has way too many strings dangling off of it. It looks like a rag. I am so disappointed. I think I got a defect.


Very nice...fit well.


Nice cold night dress


I love this dress! I can wear it to work or walking around the city. Im definitely getting it in another color before summer is over


Love this dress!!!  Super cute and comfy!!


I bought this to take on vacation and I love it. I use it multiple ways, I use it as a dress with some wedges cause I'm 5'2 and it's a bit long. I use it as a beach cover up. I use it as a house dress. I male a knot on the side and wear it causal with flat sandals, flip flops. I also wear it right out of the shower as a robe type cover up as I'm doing my hair and makeup. It's amazing and soft too.


Comfortable, fun, tie dye dress!!!


It's really cute but it's way too big. I'm usually a small/medium and after reading the reviews I ordered a small and it's still too big.
