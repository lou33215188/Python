Just a bit too small and tight around my bottom.


Ran really really large for my frame. Could be cute on someone else.


This dress is really cute and fit as expected. Material could be thicker but it still was ok. I will use this as a cover up or beach dress but not as a everyday casual dress.


I wish it came in other colors, plain, and tank top version! So comfortable, definitely go down a size it is very flow-y. I will get more! Looks great and is machine washable and soooo comfortable! I'm glad it popped up as I was on Amazon and I decided to order it. I never purchased clothes on Amazon but I will continue to because this was such a great purchase! Love it!!!


Very cute!  My only complaint is the length.  It's a bit long.  Definitely size down, otherwise you'll look like you're wearing a moomoo.  Love the soft material!


Ordered a large instead of XL.  Fit very well. Love the black/yellow. Great price and style.  Will wear a slip but very soft and comfortable.


Strange fitting. Dragged on the floor...in the front only (and I am tall). Clingy in all the wrong ways. If you have any flaws to hide ladies, steer clear. Returning.


I love the dress and the material but the dress was just to big! I am usually a size 6 and this dress in Small was still to big! Had to return.


Very cute dress. I am looking forward to wearing it.


Just received the dress today and I LOVE it!  I read the other reviews and true to what they say it does run large.  I usually wear a 2x top ( I like comfortably loose) and bought this dress in a large and it fits perfectly!  Nice shape without being clingy.  Not so loose that im swallowed in it.  Im about 5'5" and the dress is not too long or too short.
