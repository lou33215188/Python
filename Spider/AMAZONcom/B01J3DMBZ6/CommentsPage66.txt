gorgeous!


Two stars because it was the right pattern/color one star because "large" apparently equates to can fit 2 adults inside.


It's okay for summer


I love this dress it is so comfy and theres pockets


I had to get it altered because it was too long and big around the shoulders.


Way too long


too cheaply made.


love this dress!! It is thin, cool, and comfy. I do already have a hole in the pocket, but who cares.


Great


The MOST comfortable summer dress I've ever owned!
