Super comfy and fits great! Smudge long for shirt gals but I just tied the front in a knot


I love the dress. I bought a medium. I will definitely need heels as this dress is long and hits the floor.


I love it. Ordered it in a medium, should have gotten a small.


Love the material and the pockets! It was very loose fitting and works with or without a belt!


Got these for my wife's birthday!  She loves em!  She wanted pockets too!  Thanks!


Runs entirely different, size-wise, from the solid dreses


It is so soft and comfortable! I'm short so I hemmed it but fits nice.


Love it .. true to size and live the pockets


Perf


Love this! Great material
