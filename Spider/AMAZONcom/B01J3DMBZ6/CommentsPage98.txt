I like the dress very much


Love this dress! I ordered it in green too! Fits as described. Nice jersey material.


Love this dress! Does not cling to the body and fits great. I normally wear a large, but got the medium and love it! The pockets make it that much better!!


I love it thnaks


A little long and the fabric is a little see through - however it is very comfy and I wear it often


It's big but it's supposed to be big so if ur not into the super loose look then don't buy it. I loved it and it's good material .


This dress is made of 100% cheap polyester. It is count for a size xs. I donated it my local Good Will.


It is just what I was looking for! The perfect beach lazy day dress!


The color was as expected.  Not a fan of the material.


This is my new favorite dress. Light weight, SO softy and comfy (feels like a long well-worn t-shirt), and can easily be dressed up or down. I'm 5' 2", 160 lbs and usually wear a size Large (or an XL in juniors sizes) I can never buy maxi dresses because they will always be a few inches too long. The medium is a perfect fit for me, so I would say order down a size or 2. (I have a larger chest, so if you have a small chest, maybe order down 2 sizes depending on how loose you want it to be.) I have been receiving compliments left and right. Tempted to buy it in another color, but I'll see how it holds up after a couple of washes.
