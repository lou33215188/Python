Good fit - fabric not as soft or breathable as I would like.  Good for the price


it's long; if you are short, you will need to wear heels.


Love this dress!  Great fabric and drapes well. Will be ordering more.


Very comfortable.


Fabric, color, cut, all better than expected! My daughters want to steal it from me which means it is a keeper!!


I got this dress to wear to a casual event that I wanted to look nice at, but now all I want is to wear this dress everyday. The material is so soft and stretchy that you feel like you can do ANYTHING in it. I'm going to buy it in multiple colors for when the weather warms up.


I love this dress, it is extremely comfortable and fits just as expected.


Very comfortable.


Super cute and very comfy!


Very comfortable.  A little long on me but I’m 5’2”.
