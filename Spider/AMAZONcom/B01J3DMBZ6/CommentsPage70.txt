I'm 5'4 and weigh 125. I bought this dress in a smalll and it's huge!!! It's too long and way too wide. But the quality is good. It's super soft and light weight.


Very comfortable and soft, a bit loose fitting but looks great cinched with a belt


Love the casual style. Can't wait to wear it!


The item came stained, not too horribly, so I still wear it. I'm not a fan of polyester, but it is cute.


I love my dress so much that I ordered one for my daughter and as soon as I can figure out which color I want next, I am going to order another one for myself!  The fabric is amazing. I can imagine wearing this to a pool party, the beach, to a summer BBQ or almost any event outside this summer.  It is so soft and comfortable that you could even sleep in it! I am 5 ft 7 inches tall and weigh 121 pounds. I ordered a small so that I could have a little extra room so that I could wash it in warm water and dry it on warm in the dryer.  It may have shrunk a little bit but it fits exactly like the one on the model.  The fabic washed and dried without changing.  It hangs beautifully as it is not fly away or see through like gauze.  I did take it to a tailor and had it shortened so I could wear flat sandals with it but with heels (2-3 inches) it would have been fine. I also had the pockets removed as they were not something I would ever need and I like the look better.  This is an amazing little dress for an even more amazing price!
