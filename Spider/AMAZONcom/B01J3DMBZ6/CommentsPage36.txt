Do not care for this dress at all. Not flattering just falls on me like a mumu.


Nice at first but after first wash it got all distorted! The slits donâ€™t line up.


This is my new favorite dress!!  I'm a size 18 women's, I ordered a large and it fits beautifully!!  I'm planning to order other colors. Ships fast too.


The cut of the bottom hem and the stupid WAY too high side slits made this look like a frumpy house wife pajamas shirt. Returned.


I ordered a large and it fit perfect, I am 5'5" 185 lbs 38DD. Love it, its exactly as pictured. Can't wait to wear it this Summer.


I like this dress but I got a Large and it fits nice and fits the right areas but I would rather get 1size larger just in case it shrinks it is a nice dress great fabric most def will buy again


Not completely sold. Might be just a lay around the house type of dress.


Very cute, and crazy comfortable. But it is really oversized. I'm 5'2", 150 lbs, and ordered the small, which fit flowy. I may get another one and size down to an extra small. I'm very small through my ribs though, so I need clothes to be tight there otherwise I look like I'm wearing a potato sack.


I love this dress. It's nice a loose and well made. I love that is has pockets and is great to throw on when I don't know what to wear. It perfect for the beach or a warm day. There are side slits on the bottom of the maxi which make it easy to walk and flow nicely. The dress is very long though. So it may drag for shorter people. I am 5'6" and about 120 lb and I ordered a small.


so cute on, but it is hang dry only.. stuck mine in the dryer and it shrank unevenly and badly. 5'4" 147lbs and small fits me.
