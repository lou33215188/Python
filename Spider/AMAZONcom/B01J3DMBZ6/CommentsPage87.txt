Love this dress! It can be dressed down with sandals, and dressed up with peep-toe heels and fierce make up. Material is soft and flows but the double slits in the dress make it edgie.


This dress is beautiful! You can't beat it for the price. I am 5'7, 158 pounds and purchased this dress in a size medium. The dress was not fitted or too loose.


This looked cute, but was sewn with the pattern inside out on one panel, so sent it back!


Even though it's a little large, I do not mind as I wear it just around the house.  Very comfortable.


Love it bought 2 more with one being a gift.


I am 5'3" and this pooled at my feet. No wonder the model (typically a taller woman) needed heels. Unwearable.


Favorite Summer dress!!!! Fits great and I'm somewhat a large woman in a size 16 and 5ft tall


I am wearing it now.  Love It!!!!!


Favorite dress of the Season! I get lots of compliments


Comfy and cute! I wear this ALL the time.
