Very comfortable and stretchy..  Fabric is super soft  and pockets add an additional luxury to dress.  I will be ordering another.

Love it, comfy!


Cute, but runs VERY BIG!! I got a medium to be slouchy... I should've got an xs....


Absolutely love this dress. I dressed it up with heels but it also looks great dressed down with a pair of sandals.


I really love this dress. It's comfy and airy. It's also $25 so how could you ever complain??


Love this! The material is thick but really soft. It's super long and fits perfect; oversized but hangs beautifully.  I'm 5'9, 125lbs and ordered the S which was perfect. If you're looking for something more snug fitting this probably isn't for you, otherwise grab one now!


Great price and a great look!


This is so comfy.  Fun, casual look.


Very cute super soft fabric
