Supersoft and super comfortable. Fits very well.  Is also very long for tall people.  I'm 5'5" and it goes almost all the way down to my feet.


Love it, comfy and so cute, canâ€™t wait to wear it at the beach!!


I absolutely love this dress! I'm 5'6, 6 months pregnant and a large fit me well and complimented my curves. Plus the colors looks great against my dark brown skin tones.


This is a clingy material the design is twisted & not appealing


Loved it.  It is so comfortable.  Very good quality and great price.
