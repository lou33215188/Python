Love the fit, comfort and style.  Oh yes, the pockets are a definite plus.


LOVE!!! So soft and looks way more expensive than it was!


So cute and comfy!


Really comfortable fabric


Perfect.  You can't go wrong. Love it.


I really liked this dress until I washed it 3 times.  Now its twisted and the split is over one leg and the other split has moved towards the back. The V neck is now off center.  As you can guess, I no longer wear it.  I've contacted the seller to exchange but no answer.  In this case, I wish I had a store to return my item.


I love it. Soooooo comfy gonna order more I want every color. Price is right ğŸ’•


Runs a little big. But loved it so much I ordered another one in a different color.


Flowy and comfortable. Perfect for casual summer days


The quality is awesome
