Love this dress. Great quality fabric for the price. Love to pockets and slits on the side. Very lightweight. Perfect for summer or beach wear.


Super cute!! Great material, even cuter belted. Love it.


So comfortable and tons of compliments. It's nice and baggy - that's the point. So if you want it more fitted, order a smaller size.


I bought this because it looked comfortable and it is!  It's a bit long for a size small, but hoping it will shrink a bit when washed and dried.


Comfy, cute, fit runs large.  I wear a medium, should have gotten a small.


Love it! So comfy!


Feels and looks very cheap


I'm 5'8" and the length is perfect. Love the style, purchased it in the blue and brown.


Perfect maxi!


Nice but way too long
