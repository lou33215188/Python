This dress is very cute and versatile. I wear a dress size 14/16 and I ordered an extra large. I love the fit which is more of a relaxed look. A large would have been a great fit as well. I will be wearing this off the shoulder which makes it look chic and sexy. I will be wearing this on my Caribbean vacation. The material is great, it has a nice weight which does not feel cheap. However, it's cool and flowy for summer. I would order this again and for a friend as well. Don't be on the fence; just go for it!


Loved everything about it.  Length wasn't too long, but long enough; material stretched in all the right places; no need to wear a slip because it isn't thin material that you can see through.  I received many compliments from males and females. I'm going to order another color and my Mom wants one also.


My only negative mark is that there's only one pocket.  I guess I'll have to choose between the lipstick or the keys.  :-)


The fabric feels like nice, soft and cooling. Thin, but not cheap or fall-apart thin. Undergarments ARE visible beneath, but it is not incredibly see-through.


I am 5'7" 170lbs, weight is pretty evenly distributed, but I am larger in the bust (38DD). I ordered a MEDIUM and it feels and looks loose. I generally like loose, but this is basically a "doesn't touch my body, just hangs from my shoulders" kind of loose.


Also, at 5'7" it is quite uncommon that something is too long for me. With standard sandals, and even my boots, the back of this dress is fully resting on the ground. At least an inch or so.


I like the style and print, but I will be returning because of size/length and visibility through the fabric.


I gave this 4 stars because it looked quite cute, but It is very concerning to our family that this is one of at least 8 clothing items shipped by Amazon have arrived with this kind of strong offensive odor in recent months!!  Couldn't even try it on, due to the strong odor.  We are very careful to use safe cleaning products etc in our home, and it is super disappointing and even a bit alarming to unwrap something with this kind of issue from Amazon.


Love it! What a beautiful dress! I got mine in the blue.  Size wise, I'd say the Large fits up to a size 18. Even if you're bigger than that, it'd still fit if you don't mind it a bit snug. All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.


It's just as comfortable as your favorite T-shirt. I've slept in it, shopped in it,  and worn it to a picnic. I throw it in the washer and dryer  and it comes out great. Need something comfy to watch a movie in? This is the one.


I AM 5'8", 117 LBS,29" WAISTE,AND A 34C. I USUALLY WEAR A MEDIUM OR 8/10 ON THE TOP AND A LG ON 10/12 ON THE BOTTOM WITH AN INSEAM OF 34. I ORDERED THIS DRESS. IN THE COFFEE COLOR IN SIZE SMALL AND I COULDNT BE HAPPIER. IT'S VERY SOFT, NOT SEE THROUGH AND DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A SAC ON ME. IT'S VERY FLOWY AND LOOSE AND JUST PERFECT FOR ME. I USE A WHEELCHAIR SO I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE LENGTH BUT IT COMES TO THE BOTTOM OF MY SANDALS. I SUPPOSE IF I DIDN'T SIT DOWN, IT MAY DRAG A TINY BIT ON THE FLOOR WHICH WOULD STILL BE COOL. I'M VERY PLEASED AND MAY ORDER ANOTHER. OH, THE SHOULDERS TO TEND ST SHOW MY BRA STRAPS SO I'LL PROBABLY WEAR A LACE BRALETTE WITH IT.â˜®


Super comfy! Glad I read the reviews on size. I'm currently 8.5 months pregnant, 5'11" and 200lbs and this is a medium. So yeah, runs pretty dang big. But will fit great when I get my body back ;)


Too small for my body compared to how the model is wearing it. On me the XL fit snug to my curves (I'm a 16W). I kept it, though, because it's very soft and comfy even though it's fitted in my case.


Love love love! It runs a little large but I ordered my normal size for a looser fit. I'm 5'9 and this dress just brushed the floor. Looks super cute down or tied up. I love wearing it as a swim coverup while camping or dresses up for date night.
