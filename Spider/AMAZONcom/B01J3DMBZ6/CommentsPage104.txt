too small. definitely no need to order 2 sizes down. as review said. had to return. too bad, liked it.


EXTREMELY LONG!!!!!


So cute! A little long, but I'm only 5'5".


I am 5'7" and the small was a perfect fit, just the right length.  So comfortable, great for the beach.  I orginally ordered the Medium and it was to large.


Love love love  size L fit  feels and looks great  I am 5 ft  so I just cut off the bottom that was too long


Beautiful dress! Extremely comfortable! Will be purchasing in every color available.


Although I wear a small in most, I am 5'4 130.... I ordered XS after reading reviews.. fits great, front part goes to floor.


love it so comfortable


I knew it ran large so ordered the correct size one size smaller than I typically wear.


Fits so comfortably.  Recommend it.
