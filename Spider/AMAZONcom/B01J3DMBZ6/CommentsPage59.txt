The fabric is sort of clingy. Doesn't look that great. Also the fabric is washed out looking in comparison to the photo. Not so much contrast.  On me, just saying, it is not that it doesn't fit but it looks like a nightgown. And a very unflattering one at that. That's the grits from my perspective


Cute dress, easy for summer


I am OBSESSED with this dress! I love the soft, stretchy material, and the pockets are a great touch. I am 5'6" and bought a Medium and it hits perfectly at my ankles. Looks great dressed up or down for different occasions. 10/10 would recommend this product.


Super cute and comfy. Runs large size two sizes down


Love it, I am about to order a second.


I am 5'5 fluctuate in weight between 160-140lbs: currently closer to the top end the medium fits perfect.


Very cute but I am 5 3" and it was still long even with heels on!


I ordered the small and needed to get it taken in some.. But I absolutely love it...


I ordered the “grey” and got a dress that has a spandex material and looks more blue. Not worth returning. Will probably use as a swim cover up I guess. I’m 5’10 155 and ordered a small.


This is a very comfortable dress and fits well - not too tight or loose.  I am happy with this dress.


Such a cute fit! Loose in all the right places! Great traveling dress. I bough to wear home on a flight and it is the perfect weight material for that. The pockets add good detail and who doesn't love a pocket dress! Would buy again!
