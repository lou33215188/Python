Bought a large, usually, I'm a 12-14. I like the the cloth, colour, and print but the cut is more like a semi- fitted tshirt on the upper body than a boho slouchy tee, flowy on bottom. May just fit like that because I have a thick upper body and need a size up. Will keep and hopefully it will sit better when I'm slimmer again.


I love this dress! Great for running errands before or after the pool.


I'm 5'3, 120 lbs and 23 weeks pregnant. An X Small fits great! And it will still fit when I'm not pregnant. Its very hard to find a Maxi dress that's not too baggy or too long for me. This dress is great!


Too long for me but perfect for my 5'8" daughter.  She loved how comfortable this dress is.


Very comfortable, I wear it with leggings.


Good quality materials...bit long and large


So cindy use as a nightgown to big dress unless take to cleaners hem


This dress is really pretty but is a tad on the long side. I'm a 5'5'' female and it drags the floor a bit. The material is heavy too so its not just me being short. Im going to try to hem it bit and see if I can get the length right. The material, although heavy, is really nice and not see-through.


Not as expected at all. Returned


I love the fit. I'm 5 ft 4 in tall. The outfit is a little long but with heels it's the perfect length. On the beach, it's the perfect cover-up. I ordered a medium size.
