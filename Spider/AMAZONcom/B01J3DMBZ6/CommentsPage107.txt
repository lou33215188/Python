Great fit! Really nice fabric. I’m 5’5” 210lbs and I purchased a large.


It's a little long.  The fabric is stretchy and soft. Love the pockets!


5'2 3/4" tall.  It is a wee bit long, but with an inch heel perfect.


Great fit and soft frabric! Definitely a comfortable dress.


The dress fits tight and is too small. I will need to return it


I knew this was a cheap dress but the quality is tragic- makes forever 21 look well made and classy.


Looks great, not see through, thank goodness.  Really like it.


Love this dress,so soft and comfortable, want to get another color.


Comfy!  Perfect if you are a tall gal....


This dress was entirely too large!! The style was good, but I just can't wear it. Beware if you're at all short
