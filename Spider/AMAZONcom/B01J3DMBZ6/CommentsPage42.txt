Super cute and way comfortable dress. I wasn't sure what to really expect for the price and I was thinking I would probably have to return but its perfect!


I'm dying of comfi-ness!!!


I washed it and it is still like new...send me all of themmm!!


I got a Medium, probably could have gotten a small. Wear a belt with it to make it look better, but super cute dress for the beach!


I liked the dress very much. Super well made, exactly as pictured. I will definitely order in other colors in the future. Thank you very much!


Returned, very thin material. Reminded me of a nightgown, odd fit


This dress is super cute. It is long (but not too long!) I am 5'2" and 130 lbs, I got the small. I want them to do different designs so I can order more!!


I love this dress. Casual to dinner, sexy, stylish, soft, cute cute cute


I really love this dress! I ordered a size medium I wish I ordered a large but I naturally like things more baggy. The fit I felt is true to size however still with enough room to where it didn't feel so tight like spandex so if you want it baggy order a size up if you like it to fit you where it shows your curves but not super tight with some loose fit order your regular size.


This arrived very quickly.  It is very comfortable and I got a lot of compliments on how cute it is.


The dress is super cute! Its very long- I am 5'8" and it just hits the ground. It has pockets which is great, but they are low and pull the dress down in a weird way sometimes (especially if you put anything in them!) I would 100% recommend this dress to taller ladies who are looking for an easy summer maxi dress. The fabric is thick enough to be full coverage but not hot.
