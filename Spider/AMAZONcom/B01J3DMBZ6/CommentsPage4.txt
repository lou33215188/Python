Omg this dress is gorgeous. I got the brown color tie dye. Size Medium but could do small. I'm 7 mos pregnant. 5'9 and upper 150's pregnancy weight for reference (usually a size 6-8, 140-145) - I'm going to buy 2 more rt now. Perfection.


I really like this dress but returned it because the pockets hit me right at my hips and makes me look wide. I am 5'6", ordered the XS, and the length was perfect. The material is very soft and high quality. It is tailored a bit in the back, sleeves, and around the neck which makes it feel better than some dresses like this I've tried. Because of my slender build (A cup) a bit more streamline would have been good for me. I think this would be great on some one more curvy.


Super comfortable but the fabric stretches too long from its own weight. I'm 5'5" and a size 12 and within the first hour of wearing, the pockets had stretched down to my knees and the dress had become too long to walk in.


So I used scissors to trim about 5" off the hem. I haven't done anything about the pockets yet, but why bother when it's the MOST-COMFORTABLE-NIGHTGOWN-EVER!!! The all-way stretch fabric means no pulling - even when I slide around and roll over in my sleep!


Love this dress! I originally bought the small. This dress runs big. I returned the small and got the extra small. I'm 5'4" and 120 lbs. The extra small is still big but much better than the small. The fabric is so soft and the dress is very comfy!! I might order it is some other colors!


LOVE this dress! I was finally able to wear it since we had our first day below 90! I have never had so many compliments on an outfit before. I'm a size 14 generally but frequently have issues because of my DD girls. This dress runs large and flows beautifully over my curves. The fabric is the perfect weight and is not see-through.


I bought this dress for a cruise I went on in January. It ended up being the most versatile dress/swimsuit cover! It was perfect and I wore it at some point almost every single day. It packs amazing! No wrinkles! Super soft! POCKETSğŸ˜�!


I am 5â€™8â€� about 125lbs. O bought the size M because I wanted a looser fit and extra length because I am tall. It was perfect but I probably could have gone with the size small as well.


I loved that it was actually long enough too, just hitting the floor. If you are short, this may not be the dress for you, although it would look adorable with wedges too.


I did take off one star, only because it did shrink a little after I washed and dried it. If you donâ€™t have room for any shrinkage, make sure you lay flat or hang to dry.

(First picture I had thrown the dress on really quick after the beach and didnâ€™t realize it was on backwards until after the picture ğŸ˜‚ğŸ¤£. Second picture shows it is a true vneck).


I'm torn on how to rate this because it's cute, comfortable and I got a lot of compliments on it, but ultimately you only get about a month out of the garment because the fabric pills badly and looks old and ratty after that.  I think the reason no one is commenting on it is that they are writing their reviews right after they receive the garment.  I bought several colors, and loved them all for a month or so before the fabric became too pilled to look good.  It pills wherever it rubs against anything - your arms, your purse, your hips, sides of breasts, under your arms, butt where you sit.  So for me it's a disposable short-term garment or special occasion (wear once/twice) type garment.  Some cottons pill, others don't - this does!


I am so in love with this dress I want to order it in every color! I live in NY so it's a little too cold to wear it right now but I can't wait for the spring/summer. I'm about 5'6 140 pounds and I ordered a small. It's definitely very loose fitting and is floor length just how I like it (but not too long) so obsessed can't wait to get the other colors!!


I had big dreams for this dress. I was going to be the cool chick in the photo, minus the boots, and hat and height... But you get it. I envisioned myself feeling like this would be my funky, comfy dress. But it's big. Really big, like wide. And long. And this particular dress is not cut straight, so the entire dress is sideways from the neck down. And the fabric is clingy thin. Too inexpensive to bother sending back, not comfortable enough to wear even around the house. Bummer.


I wish I could give 3.75 stars, as I do not like the way the pockets lay underneath this dress.  I will have to constantly smooth them out.  But I can live with it and otherwise, this is a nice dress.  I'm 5'6" and typically an XL/14/16 and the large fit well, so I'll say this dress runs on the larger side.  It is not fitted and skims my body well; the length is perfect and the fabric is jersey material that feels light and airy.  This will be a nice run around town, beach or pool dress.  I may entertain another color and do recommend.
