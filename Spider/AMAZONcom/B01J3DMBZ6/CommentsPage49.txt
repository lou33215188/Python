My dress has the colors that I choose but it's not the same as in the picture, I bought a S size and fits more like a M or L to me and it doesn't have that line in the waiste like in the picture and the pattern it's different too. I do can say that the fabric it's still good quality and the pattern for my luck is not ugly so I'm still keeping it but wasn't what I was expecting.


Way too roomy, did not care for the flow of the fabric.  Just didn't work for my body type.


This dress is THE BEST and super comfy! I wear small to medium and ordered an extra small. This is a must have!


Really like this dress!


Great comfy dress. And it has pockets. Love the color. Wish I bought all the colors.


Beautiful material just bigger then expected


Didn't like the material


Love this dress .... I got lots  compliments all day  It's runs a lil big . Just go down one size .


Love this dress! Very elegant, flowy but complimentary. Also very comfortable. I'll probably buy another in a different color. I got a small - I'm 5'3" size 10 and it fit great and just the right length.


Comfy, needs belt!!
