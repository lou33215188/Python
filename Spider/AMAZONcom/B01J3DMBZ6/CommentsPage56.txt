Bought this for a friend and she loves it. Very cute, and soft material!


The material is everything! Soft yet sexy and feminine. Love it, may buy more


I love this dress. Cute and comfortable, but long. It might be too long for shorter-statured people. I'm about 5'5" and it touches the ground.


In love with this dress!


This is so comfy and very cute!  I could live in one in every color! :). The fit is a little baggy, based on the photo I think that's how it's supposed to fit.  If you don't like that I would suggest sizing down one size.


I wear a size large but read some reviews that said down a size so I went down to a medium. Could have went down to small but I like the baggie look other than that the great is great.


Absolute favorite!!! Sooo comfy!  Runs a bit large


Like the dress but wish I would have ordered a small.


LOVE THIS DRESS, it’s really flowy and I usually prefer things to be tighter at the waist, so I used a belt to accentuate my waist and it looked so nice! I would definitely recommend this if you’re on the fence.


SO comfy!!! I could live in this dress!!!
