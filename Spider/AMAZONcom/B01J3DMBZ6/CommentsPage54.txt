Thin material but really cute for the price


Runs large as noted by others, great comfy maxi with big pockets


Soft material, but dress doesn't look good on.


Love it. The way these hang are lovely.


Cheaply made but good to wear around the house


So comfy and cute! 10/10 would recommend to everyone. I now want it in all of the colors!


Nice, flowy casual dress for summer, I've gotten lots of compliments.


Perfect outfit for teaching! Comfortable, modest and flattering. The pockets are an added bonus! I got so many compliments on this outfit.


Super cute dress.. definitely long and baggy but overall great buy for the price


Very comfortable to wear, very light.
