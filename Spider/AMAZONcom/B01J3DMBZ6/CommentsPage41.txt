I have bought other similar dresses on Amazon from other sellers and this one is on the chintzy side...fabric is very thin and flimsy.


Gave this dress as a gift and she loved it. Nice material and fit exactly as we thought it would. Very happy with this purchase.


Absolutely love this dress.


It does run big!


I'm 5'4 150lbs. Usually a large.


Ordered a medium, and still a bit to big and long.


Should have gone with a small!


nice dress, it is see-through - thats the only downside.  the pockets are nice to have.  slits up the sides are great for movement.  washes well, I let it hang dry, no dryer.  glad I got it !!


Very soft and comfortable, not see thru. Feels like a big long t-shirt with pockets. I love it!


I love this dress, it was cute and comfortable and I received many compliments on it. It does run very large but it is supposed to fit loose. I am 5â€™6 160lbs and I got an extra small which still fits me very loose. I usually wear a sm-md in dresses.


The fabric is crazy soft and light. The only thing that I don't like are the pockets which stick out on your hips and look slightly unflattering.


A great looking piece that is truly fun for casual days and nights. I got the x-small and it fits just right, but this whole thing is quite forgiving.


Very long..had mine taken up...loved so much bought my tall sister her favorite color purple..Very comfortable and can be worn for any occasion!


I love the fit, fabric, cut, color---wonderful!!!!!
