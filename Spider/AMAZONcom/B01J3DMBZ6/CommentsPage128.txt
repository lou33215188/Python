This was supposed to be loose and billowy. I even ordered a size up and what came was fitted and looked like pyjamas. I returned it.


Fits large, and there is a large hole in one of the pockets when I first tried it on. Also the pockets don't lie completely flat. All that being said it is cute comfy fabric that is good for travel.
