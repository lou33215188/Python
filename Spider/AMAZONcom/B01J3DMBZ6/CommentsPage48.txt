I love this dress. Very comfy . I am 5 3 & 130 pounds. I got the small and it was too big. I ordered another in XS and it fits great. I even ordered another one in the grey. Love it!


much tighter than expected


Arrived just like description! Very fun and flattering to wear casual in the summer time. Would recommend to a friend.


Exceeded my expectations! So soft and comfy, drapes nicely, pockets are fantastic!


I absolutely love this dress. Mine was about an inch or so to long so I couldn't wear flats, but I've gotten so many compliments on it, and it's so comfortable. Definitely a great buy


This is one of my most favorite dresses! I need one on every color! So easy, fits great, not sheer at all. Light weight and easy to wear. I am 5'5" and ordered a large and definitely had to knot tie the bottom so I didn't trip over it but other than that I LOVE this dress.


It's cute, but it's too long. I'm 5'5, 115 lbs. Ordered the xs & it's dragging on the floor. You would have to wear heels with it if you're my size. Oh and it's pretty low cut.


Great! Ordered a medium, could have done a small. I'm 5'7 and 136lbs. Works great though! Ordered another one. Great for traveling.


Very cute and comfortable. I love this dress


I like it, it's soft and pretty, but a bit snug. My size, but runs small.
