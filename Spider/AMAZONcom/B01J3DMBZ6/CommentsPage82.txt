The dress is fantastic. Love the pockets and the fact that there are sleeves. By reading past reviews I thought the fit would be bigger but it fits just right.


Fabric could be nicer, but cute.


I’m 5’7 and had to get it hemmed.  It was longer than expected.


I love this dress!  It's so comfortable!


Very thin fabric.


This is super comfortable and cute! Just as pictured. Maybe order a size down- it's a little long- but nothing a little knot can't fix!


This dress is a wonderful quality. I get several compliments every time I wear it out. It's breathable so it's perfect for warm weather. Overall, this was a great purchase!


Super comfy - love the fit! I got an XS & I’m 5’6 130lbs so might want to order smaller a than usual.


The second time I ordered a small and it fit perfect in length and not tight at all , 5'5 160 pounds


great quality- but i'm a true medium and this fit really oversized. i would need a small or extra small. 5'6", 138 lbs.
