Love how comfortable this dress is.  I'm 7 months pregnant and it's a great dress to casually wear for errands, etc with enough room to fit as my belly continues to grow.


I love this dress! It is so comfy and flattering. I was hesitant because I am pear shaped but it worked. It is a very long dress so I have to wear heels or it drags (5'5"). It is stretchy enough/low cut enough to work for breastfeeding or even maternity without being immodrst or looking like a maternity/nursing dress.


Nice material, stylish. Wish it was a bit shorter. I am 5'6 and it is just too long for me.


Runs a little big but will look good as a bathing suit cover up.


Love this dress & get compliments every time I wear it.  It looks great with flip flops or chunky sandals.  It's a little too low neck for me so I wear a black camisole under it.


Nice dress, just as shown on the photo.  However, it does run large and long.  I got the xtra-small and needed to get it shortened.  I'm 5'3"


Very long.......nice smooth fabric.Will cling a bit to body.


super soft, light, very nice.


Horrible....I donated it to Purple Heart the day I received it.


love this dress. Returned because the right side hung lower than the left side at the bottom, and it looked odd.
