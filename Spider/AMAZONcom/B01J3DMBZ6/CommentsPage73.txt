Very comfortable, perfect for hot summer days


Beautiful and super comfortable dress! I am 5'7 140 lbs and I got a small and fits perfectly, still a flowy/loose and has the perfect to-the-ankle length that doesn't drag on the ground when wearing flat sandals. Very flattering.


So cute for a fall maxi! Fitted perfect!


Love-super cute&comfy-will look great with boots!! Exactly what I wanted!!!!!


Super comfy, super flattering. I'm 5'7", 150 lbs and this fit beautifully.


Super comfy. Went with an XS, I am 5'3, 128 lbs.. it is still pretty roomy, but I like the slightly oversized look. I am going to belt this when I wanna make it a little sleeker, but otherwise, I love it as is.


I'm 5'2 so this dress was a little long- which I expected. So I tied it up in the front and it looked super cute!!


Great loose summer dress. I also wore it to the beach multiple times.


It's so comfortable and fits exactly as expected.


Cute and fits well
