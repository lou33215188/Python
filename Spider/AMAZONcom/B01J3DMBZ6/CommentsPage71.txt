My fav


This took me more then a month to get! It is not a cotton flowy fabric like it looks online, it's almost like swimsuit material and it came from China, so that explains it I guess.The only thing similar to the picture is the shape. Very cheaply made.


I was hoping that this could be something that I could wear for many occasions, but this is a very casual dress. Ended up being loose on the bottom and a bit tight in the chest. The color didn't seem to quite be a vivid as I was expecting either.


runs too long


Super long


could have sized down from other reviews written. but still fits baggy and feels nice‚ù§it


This dress is flattering if you have a little weight you would like to hide and can be easily tied at the waist with a cute belt.


Fitss as expected cool summer dress


Very nice dress. Looks just like the photo. I'm 5'9" and it is long to the floor. After washing and drying, the length looks like it shrunk just a little.


Dress was exactly as stated.  Fit was great and very comfortable.  Love the pockets.  It is going to be perfect for my long flight to Puerto Valletta in a few weeks.  Flying needs comfortable clothing.
