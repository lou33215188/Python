It's a loser fitting dress so if you are in between sizes I'd size down. It's a cute dress.


Comfy and looks great on a variety of body types.


Love it!!!


I bought a size smaller and fits perfectly, lovely casual maxi dress


Nice & long, comfortable, very cute


Awesome dress! Fits like a glove and goes with my bohemian style!


Love it.


Love the style & especially the pockets!


Slightly see threw so better as a cover up or wear something under it. Love the pockets!


Nice dress. Runs big though.
