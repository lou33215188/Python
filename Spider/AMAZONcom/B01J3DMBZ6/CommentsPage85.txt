Very comfortable


Super cute and comfortable!! Love it..:)


This is a great dress! Very simple, comfy and the pockets are cute! The fabric is a little stretchy and may be on the cheaper side ... but for the price I am in love. I hope Amazon recommends more like this.


Great dress. Versatile and comfy. Would have given 5 but fabric color fades. Wash and hang dry.


Love how this dress is so comfy and flattering!


Great little dress for relaxing, casual times. Super soft and comfy.


It will be fine for around the camp-fire; but definitely not something that I would wear to go to the store.


I love this dress, it is a bit heavier than expected but I still love it! I'm 5"0" 140 and I got a small and it comes down to me feet without shoes.


Love this dress!  Size is perfect. Soft and comfy material. Doesn't cling to body but not baggy and sloppy. Will order other colors.


Amazing
