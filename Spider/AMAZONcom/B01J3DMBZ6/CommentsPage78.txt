I love this dress!


Love this dress! Just wish it came in more colors in the long sleeve!


I. Love. This. Dress. It's soo comfy and light and breezy and not see through, perfect for a hot LA day. I usually wear all black everything but this is so much better for summer, AND it still looks good with my black boots.


Love it. I was worried it would be too boxy but it's very flattering. I wear a women's medium and the medium here fit perfect. Only thing is I'll probably lave to wear biker shorts/dlip because it's sheer.


Great casual dress, well made .


Nice material. I will wear with flats, I'm 5'6" and will probably have it hemmed .


love it


Would loved to of liked this dress but it runs very large. I'm 5'6 165 pounds and the medium at least one size too big. I'm also very long waisted and the pockets were to far down even for me.


It's okay...


Wish they had extra small


I liked the dress; however, the pattern of the dress looked like a mess. When I viewed it on Amazon on the model it was cute but in person it looked like a brown smeared mess.
