I had to return this, there were holes in it like someone had accidentally cut through it with scissors. I would be willing to try again though because it was very soft, cute and decent quality aside from the holes!


Bought the XS....I'm 128 lbs & 5'8 and it is long enough! I stitched up the sides and cut off the pockets for a smoother fit.  LOVE it.


Super cute. Order a size down. I usually wear between a 12 and 14 and purchased a Medium and it fit with room.


Great dress, fits perfect.  It is so comfortable and I got lots of compliments wearing it.  Nice and long great for me since I'm 6'1"


Love this as a weekend outfit. It's so easy and the print gives it a bit of a trendy twist. Easy to pair with flat or heeled sandals and very comfortable. Love that there are pockets!!


This is a comfy dress but since it’s stretchy, I’ll have to alter it on the sides. Also, the pockets are weird.


It's a cute dress, very comfortable, and I will probably wear it on the plane for an upcoming trip. Looks exactly like the picture. For reference, I am 5'7 and 140 lbs -- athletic build -- and normally wear a size 4/6. I got the medium and it was still quite large on me.


The dress is great and comfortable but much too large. I am 5'3 and 174lbs about 6 months pregnant and the dress swallows me in a medium, would look cute belted but if you want it accessory free definitely go smaller then your typical size. Length wise at 5'3 it is fine doesn't drag, comes right to the tops of my feet.


Probably could have gone for a size smaller, but I like the dress! Relaxed fit, the fabric is a bit slinky and has a bit of a stretch, but feels cool on the skin.


I would give 5 stars because this is a super cute casual dress! BUT I did receive the wrong color!


I’m not mad because the color I got was still cute but I asked for the black and gold and got white and blue.


Other than that I absolutely love it!
