This is not the dress that is pictured in the description or in other user's reviews! Instead of being a jersey-looking material, it's a shiny cheap material. I usually either wear a large or xl but purchased the large due to other reviews. This thing is tight! It fits more like a mermaid style dress. The bottom is comical. It actually narrows out more and more towards the bottom and gives me a very weird shape. I was expecting a flowy maxi like a similar black one I purchased recently and loved. This will be going back! Also I ordered gray and got a navy blue colored tie dye instead. Just because other users post great photos doesn't mean that you'll be getting that same dress. BEWARE!


Super soft and comfortable as others have mentioned. I like the brand Free People a lot and have a lot of their clothes but I refuse to spend $100 on a t shirt dress and this one is a great substitute in style. I did go up in size from a medium to a large to get that boho oversized similar to free people fit and it fits just like I wanted ( I went by the manufacturers chart and not amazons)...I would say this is light and comfortable but not cheap. I recommend this one!


I am normally a comfortable large in most shirts and dresses but after reading the reviews, I was convinced to purchase this dress in a medium. I am so glad I did. Its still roomy and extremely comfortable. I probably could get away with a small if I wanted it more form fitting. My advice is to size at least 1 size down. I love this dress so much that as soon as it arrived, I ordered another one in a different color.


I'm a Medium top (6-8) large bottom (10-12) kind of shape and after reading the description and reviews I went with a small- this was spot on! Still a relaxed boho fit but gave me some shape. I kind of hate the pockets as they hit you at the widest thigh area but not a big deal, they lie pretty flat. Great fabric quality- super soft but not at all see through, and it held its shape from riding in the car and shopping all day. I'd totally buy this again.


Very cute and comfortable dress.  I live on a tropical island, planning fall trip to EU, temps will be colder, but don't want to invest in a 'winter' wardrobe I will only wear for a few weeks.  This dress has so many possibilities. Can go casual or dress it up with belt and boots. Can layer with leggings & sweater for cooler weather. I've run around here with it, very cool in hot temps, very comfortable.  May even wear on overnight flight, comfortable enough to be travel pj's,  cute enough to arrive in style, with no wrinkles !  I love this dress.


I ordered down in size as most reviews said it was very big.  Fabric is soft but a little clingy.  If you are curvy or have a bit of a belly I would stay at your regular size.  This is supposed to be a flowy dress.  Other than that, I don't think it is the best quality.  My pockets are two different sizes.  I would consider this a comfy dress to run errands in.


I am shocked! I never get this lucky when online shopping. Iâ€™m 5â€™3â€� 150lbs (34â€� under bust, 33â€� waist, 38â€� hips). I usually wear a medium, but after reading reviews I decided to size down to an XS. This style dress tends to look like a tent on my short frame, so I wanted it to be a little more form fitting without being too tight. Itâ€™s perfect! The material is stretchy and there is still a ton of give. The only downside is that the pockets sit a little low for my arms to reach (probably also from being short), so I may just have them taken out. Itâ€™s also a tad long, but will be great in heels. If you want it baggy, go down one size. If you want more form fitted, go down two sizes. SO COMFORTABLE! You wonâ€™t regret it.


Cute, but not the most flattering fit for me or likely anyone with my body type. I am very curvy (regardless of size), and about 30 lbs overweight since recently having a baby. I was hopeful this dress would help me look put together and slightly accentuate my curves without showing my fluff. Unfortunately, it's too big to show any of my curves and just makes me look bigger than I am and like I'm trying to hide something. Even my husband, who typically thinks I look great in everything, admitted it made me look bigger than I am. It looks better belted, and is very comfy but still not the best for me. Perhaps would have worked in a size small. For reference, I'm currently 5'6", 180lbs, size 10/12, 36E and a medium still looks too big. I know it's supposed to be loose and flowy, but I'm large enough it just doesn't look right.


Very comfortable and has a Boho vibe. I'm 5'5," pear-shaped and typically wear size 12 in dresses. I purchased this in a large but a medium would've been a better fit, in my opinion. If you're concerned that the dress will not have an oversized fit like the model's dress, don't be. This fits so loosely on me that it drags on the ground so using this one as a house dress and may order a medium later to wear out. The teal looks black until a few washes later.


I read reviews looking for measurements so I can determine what size works for me because we all know the "size chart" isn't always  accurate. So here are my measurements- hope this helps you:


I'm 5'3" ,weigh 130 and am a 36C. I ordered a small in the brown and it's perfect. I can wear heels or flats and I'm guessing the slits on each side help with that. The pockets are awesome and ad the perfect touch !  The best way to describe the material is: slinky soft.


 I love love love this dress!!!!
