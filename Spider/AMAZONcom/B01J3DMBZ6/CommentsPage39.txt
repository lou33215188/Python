Love, Love, Love. So cute, comfortable, and sexy. I would love to order one in each size.


I LOVE THIS DRESS. I want to buy every color. Its so cozy like wearing a blanket, only you look sexy while doing it.


Hangy and haggy...Very unflattering... Droopy cotton, not at all cute like the photo


I love this dress so much I bought one for both of my sisters. It is long (my twin and I are 5'4") but with the way the slits are on the sides it works fine. Our older sister is 5'8" and it's perfect on her.


I am 5'2" weigh 105 and this extra small is HUGE! Very nice flowing fabric


Way too big! I am 5’6” and 150 lbs but this dress in a M was huge! A S would have probably fit. I can’t even wear the dress but the material is soft.


It's a cute, & somewhat comfy dress, but according to the measurements, this dress should fit me loose and it does not. I usually wear an xl and if i had that size option, I'd exchange it. I'll try it on again in the morning & see how I feel about the fit but I think I'll be returning it. (Wanted a loose, boho look)


This item is definitely too small and the fabric is very light weight.


runs large in my opinion. light and airy, a little see thru though so I wore a tank top under it


I love my dress. It fits perfectly. I weigh 123lb I'm 5"4 and I ordered small. I probably could've got xs but I love how it's just baggy enough.
