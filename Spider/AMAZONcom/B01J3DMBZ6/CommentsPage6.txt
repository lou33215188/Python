I thought about returning this but decided (barely) to keep it.  The size isn't as "too large" as I'd expected from the reviews.  I ordered a large and typically wear a large.  It probably would be over-sized if it weren't for the clingy fabric. I prefer that type of fabric to have plenty of room.  What I don't like is the way the dress is laid out on the fabric. The stripes are mostly on one side.  It looks kind of lopsided.  I'm 5'6" and the length is OK for me, long but not so that I can't walk in it with low heels. It helps to wear a belt and jacket, I think.  It's definitely not expensive looking, but then it's not objectionably tacky either. It'll be good for a beach resort at night.


Love it!! I'm always looking for maxi dresses that aren't sleeveless because I'm allergic to the sun. When I found this one on Amazon I thought let's see how it is and OMG its all I wanted in a maxi and the pockets total package and then I ordered two more one fir me and one for my hairdresser which liked the dress when I went to have my hair done. Dhe also loved  the dress and used it on her vacation to Florida. Definitely recommend this dress I will buy more colors ğŸ˜�


I'm 5'1, 150 lbs, and it's super cute AND. AND. I didn't have to hem it! This is the first time in my LIFE I have not had to hem a dress. Also, this is great for nursing summer wear! I live in Houston so lightweight but not see through fabric is imperative. I can pull the neck down to nurse and it doesn't lose it's shape. Will likely order more. Pockets are kick ass.


I've had my eye on this dress for a while and finally decided to order it.  I'm 5'7" and about 118 lbs and I ordeed the coffee color in small. Perfect length and not too sheer! Those were my two main concerns when ordering this. The only thing I would change about this dress is to make it more lightweight because it feels a little heavy on. Other than that, I'd say it's a perfect casual dress. It would look great with a belt, and either heels or sandals.


I want this in every color!! It's the MOST comfortable dress I own! I'm 8 months pregnant with twins - and it's my go to dress right now! And I know it will be perfect for after delivery. It's lightweight without being see through and the slits hit right at the knee.  It's seriously perfect.  If you're on the fence - GET IT! You won't regret it one bit! I'm 5'5" and purchased a large - with my enormous belly, the hem hits my ankles right now.  I would usually order an XL, so I went a size down and I'm glad I did.  It fits just a little bit big in the shoulders and chest - which is exactly what I wanted.  It's not so loose that it's not flattering.


I really loved this dress! It's comfy and cute! I typically am between a small or medium, depending on the flow of the dress. Based on other reviews, I went with a small, and it was still pretty loose fitting. It worked well with the overall look of the dress, though.


Fit is Large in length, but regular in size. I wear a size 12 pant or size Large usually. I read the reviews and ordered a size down, Medium. It fit, but with the jersey material, it did cling to all my bumps. Not great! In addition to that, it was waaaay too long. I'm 5'3" (another reason I ordered the medium). I did return the dress. Without the length issue, I would have re-ordered a size Large and have been very happy. But, with how long it is, I didn't want to have to pay for alterations.


I love this dress! Yes, it runs large. I'm 5'6", 140 lbs., 38C, normally wear a size 8 pant and L in tops. I got this dress is Sea Green size small. It fits perfect, still loose enough to not cling and the fabric doesn't show any lumps or bumps. The sea green is more of a blue color, very pretty and can be grounded with black accessories or brown. I would wear this dress every day it's that comfortable!


Item as described. Light soft cotton maxi dress. Slits up the side. I'm 5'3" and needed to wear about 2+ inch heels in order for this not to drag on the floor. Still cute. HOWEVER... I found this same exact dress, same model picture, on a discount Asian clothing site for $19.00 and I paid $24.99. Kind of frustrating to know it was out there for cheaper. I guess it pays to do a little more research.


This dress is great. But it's too big. I got a small in their other styles so I got a small in this dress too.. but I am returning it for an xs. I'm 5'4" and 130. I think the xs will still fit great when I drop the baby weight and am back to 110.
