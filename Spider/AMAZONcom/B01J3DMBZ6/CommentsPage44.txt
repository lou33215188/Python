Colors look nothing like the photo, itâ€™s like they sewed it inside out.


I'm 5'1 36D...149lbs. and ordered a small because of the length and it's looks so cute!!! Its not right at all, very comfy!


I love this dress. I'm 5'8" 140 i got a small and it fits perfect. I would definitely recommend this dress.


Very comfy, but is a little long for me and I am 5'5". I think it looks better with a thin belt.


Extremely comfortable with soft cotton material; ordered medium which is little too big but it drapes nicely and hides my stomach especially when it's full hah! It's also long enough for my height I'm 5'8" and weigh 165, would definitely recommend.


Maybe I should have reviewed the product better it is not cotton as i though but it is as shown in pic have not wore it yet


So comfi.and don't I will order another one.


i had to return the small - it was way too long for my 5'2" height. the material is so soft and quality is great! it is not see-through which i love! i am interested in getting the xsmall, to wear comfortably with flats so it's not dragging on the floor.


Fabric is much thicker than I thought. TOO stretchy and the pockets are in a weird position. The dress would be much better without pockets.. Didn't like it at all.


LOVE this dress. my goto all summer long.
