Bag with a nice pattern. That's about it. Does NOTHING for one's figure.


I love itttt. Super comfy and although not form fitting in any way, this was exactly what I needed for my trip to Egypt. Originally this was a big long for me (I'm 5ft4) but after I washed and dried it (in the dryer), it's the perfect length. Would look super cute with a belt to give it some shape. Or if you have a food baby... or pregnant with a real baby... this dress would be perfect. Love it!


I am 5"4 and 118 pds , I ordered the extra small , it is somewhat loose on me but I like it that way , it does run very long . I can sew so I shortened it . Love the soft feel of the fabric .


This runs large!  Fabrique feels soft & seems cozy'ish.  I have not worn as of yet. Don't know if I would wear out of the house.  Pricey.


Arrived fast.


The dress lost its shape when I washed it. And is about 4 inches to long ordered a small.


This drags the floor, even with heels. I'm 5' 7".


I'm 5'6, 115 lbs. and the XS is great. Only problem is that there was a hole in 1 pocket like others have said.


I'm 5'7 about 115 and ordered the extra small.....perfect fit! Love the dress...very soft...actually it feels like a soft tshirt.


Please don't ever wash this dress ...  Or don't buy!  I can't believe I wasted $25.00 .. In the trash :(((


Real cheap material, stretchy and nearly see-through ... doesn't really look like the cool image ... returned.
