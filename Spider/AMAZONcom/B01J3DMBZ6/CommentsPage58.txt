looks more like a night gown then a dress


This dress is nice and comfortable. Thank you


ok not what I expected


Love this dress! It’s super cute and comfortable. I am 5’5” and 175 pounds, usually size 12/14. I would have ordered a large but I’m glad I read reviews about the dress running large, I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly! The length is just right.


So comfortable and pretty. Looks much like the picture. I want to revisit this item online to see if it comes in other fabric designs because I would definitely buy another one.


Very cute piece


Love! Definitely size down. I'm normally a medium and ordered a small. Fits exactly how I wanted it to. Drapes without looking like a sack. The fabric feels soft and love the color. I highly recommend!


Super comfortable and looks good.


Love this dress. Fit in all the right places.


not a bad looking dress...and really comfortable...
