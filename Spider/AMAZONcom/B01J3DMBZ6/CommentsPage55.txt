this dress is amaaaazing! the material is so soft and so comfy!!! I ordered a medium and probably should have ordered a small.. but this dress still works once I belt it!


Love it!


As a 5ft 3in size 16 woman, I was really worried about this clinging to the wrong places or being too long. Not the case at all! The fit is great, it is a little long but with the split on both sides you can just tie the bottom up! I might buy this in other colors, it is super comfy!


The material is super soft and the pockets are great! I love everything about it and will be wearing it all the time. I just ordered the short sleeve grey one as well.


Perfect for summer vacation in Europe.


Great fabric, the dress is pretty long but I added a belt and it looks fine. Looks and feels good after washing


Love Love Love This color is nice and natural. Fits very well. Soft & cozy.


Like a cheap long t shirt. Not fitting at all as pictured.


Perfect dress for my lifestyle!


I'm usually a large and the medium fit.  It's long on me as I'm only 5'1" so I have to get it hemmed.
