I like this dress. I just wish I had bought a medium instead of a large.I needed it for an event so I wore it anyway. Very comfortable and cute. Love the pockets.


Not what I expected, too big and didn't look like the picture, had to return it


Super comfy dress.  I followed others advice and ordered a size down - glad I did.


I’m 5’2” and 140lbs so it was a little too long but I just tied a knot at the end.


Love this dress, bought a medium and it's actually too big. I gathered it in the back and sewed it to fit better. But I have now worn this thru my whole pregnancy. Get compliments on it constantly.


Very cute maxi.  I purchased a thick brown belt to wear with it and it makes all the difference.


Buy this in your size unless you want a baggier fit. This dress is super comfortable and cool to wear in the summer time and pairs well with flats.


Comfy, relaxed fit. Material is soft but not clingy. Cute casual dress for the summer


This dress is so comfortable, pretty, kind of sexy.  I love everything about it.


It is comfortable and looks good on, but the dress I got doesn't even show what size it is. I'm 5'2" so I ordered an XS, and if that's actually what I got then it's about 6 inches too long on me. It honestly is too long even with heels, so I'll have to get it altered which is unfortunate since usually XS's work for my height.
