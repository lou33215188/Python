Hem is funky. Dress is twisted. Not cut on  bias correctly


This was the second of this style ordered. The bottom was crooked and had to be repaired by a tailor 3x. It will never be right. I'm mad I didn't return it immediately


Im very diappointed in this dress!! Seaming on the bottem is uneven.I have a slit on the front of the dress and one on the side.Looks ridiculous.


I love the lightweight fabric and the pockets are a great feature!


It's a great dress, but runs very large.  I ordered a large and will exchange it for a medium.  It's a jersey knit, very stretchy and comfortable.


Beautiful ...  Size small is just too big... In white it looked really big.


Great dress though.


Thanks.


Normally wearing a medium, I ordered an XS, after reading the advice online. This fits well and feels really good!


Color not as vibrant as picture, but still nice.


A little large. Ordered a medium, but I love it. Going to order another in a different color and a smaller size.


I love this dress enough even if it fits tighter than shown. Super soft and lightweight. I have two more in my shopping cart I'll be buying.
