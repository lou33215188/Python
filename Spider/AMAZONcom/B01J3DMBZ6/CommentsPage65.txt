This dress is really cute; which is why I purchased it. It is a maxi dress, & maxi dresses usually run big so go one size smaller than usual. I ordered a medium & it was too big. It is also see through. If you don't mind wearing a slip under this dress, it's perfect. I absolutely hate see through dresses, so I'll be sending this item back.


Very cute but very large.. I had to send it back


I may try and return it, if I get the time.. way to big and heavy, I ordered a small.. I'm 5'5 and 136 pounds.. I would recommend not getting it.. Does not look as cute as picture!!


Super tight and made of bathing suit material and didnâ€™t have pockets. Terrible dress!


Love! Love! Love this dress!!


I was sadly disappointed because the reviews said to buy a size or 2 smaller since they ran big !! NOT TRUE!


The dress is pretty nice, it maybe just my shape but I don't really like the back of it, it seems a little "huggish" , I would prefer cotton all the way  with out  spandex. A size up would make a world of difference also!


Itâ€™s a cute dress is just shrank after the first wash but the main reason the the 3 is that the material is too thin and show parts of the body that shouldnâ€™t be shown.


This is a great comfortable dress that can be dressed up or down.  It is comfortable but still attractive.


It was very pretty but huuuuge
