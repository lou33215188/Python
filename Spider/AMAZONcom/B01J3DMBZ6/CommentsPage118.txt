I love this! It fits great and is so comfortable!


Very nice


This dress is soooo cute! Light weight and flowy. I'm 5'7''...5'8'' and 137lb. I got an XS in the coffee color and it fits perfectly. I usually wear a small or medium in regularly clothing but since this is naturally loose I went with the XS and couldn't be happier!


It was okay.  It did run a little big


Nice dress very loose fitting as described


too large and neck opening too deep .


Nice dress,
