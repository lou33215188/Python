It's very cute. Long and the slits are perfect!!


Love the pockets!  Nice material, good quality.  I get tons of compliments on this dress!


ordered x- small.  5'2 127lbs very flowy.  bit long.  wore it to the ocean quite comfy.


So comfortable, runs a big big/long, but other than that a GREAT buy!


Cute dress, still haven't worn it yet though bc I think it may have a little nightgown vibe happening


I ordered a XL-should have ordered a L. The maxi is extremely long, I'm 5"4, it would be perfect for a tall person.


I was looking forward to the slouchiness of the dress. It appeared to be a comfortable fit. When I received the dress, it was a little too large for my liking. I figured a wash and delicate dry would do the trick. The size fit after the wash and dry; however, the dress dried funky and did not look as intended after that. Bummed out because I really like this dress.


The pink dress is closer to orange and the v neck not so much. Pattern was way more darker on one side. It does fit perfectly and is very comfortable.


Runs a lot larger than true sizes.  I wear an 8-10 and a medium swallowed me up.


I love this dress so far! I bought a Lg and I normally wear an XL. I am 5'5 and 200lb.
