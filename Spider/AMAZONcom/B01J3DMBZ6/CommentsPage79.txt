Tried it on and it fits perfectly and also has pockets. I'm wearing it this weekend and I'm not sure if it will show my underwear in the sunlight. I'm too old (45) to be risquÃ©! Great with my everyday flats. Never heels!


I ordered the dress in a small, and I found that it's a bit looser than expected but I love it! So comfy and perfect for enjoying the summer heat.


Super comfy. Great fit and stretch. Runs as expected. For something looser, one size up


Looks great on, with or without a cami underneath.  It does seem a bit long, but I'm 5'4".  It seemed to stretch longer the longer I wore it.  Maybe it will shrink a little after washing!


Loved loved this dress looks exactly like the pics. Light material very very very comfy I loved every last bit of the dress perfect length I am very short. And last but not least it made me feel sooooo beautiful


Love this dress fits perfect. I have ordered 3 in different colors


The only thing I don't love about the dress t that it has pockets. . and that is my fault for not paying better attention.  It's a really fun dress and very comfortable.


Loose fit as expected. Very comfortable and flattering~


Very comfortable! Bought a second in coffee. ğŸ˜�


Sad to return this as the fabric is super soft.  I'm 5'0" and 115 lbs. - I ordered an XS which was still too big, and it was way too long.
