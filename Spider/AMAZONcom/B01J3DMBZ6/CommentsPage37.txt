Love, love love ❤️ Comfortable, sexy, versatile-what more can I say except I wish I could wear it during the winter!


very comfy. You will love it but go up a size.


The pockets are too shallow, they keep popping out, so this is just a “house dress” now. But it’s super cute and comfortable


Really soft and cute and flattering. Im full figured and tall. It could be a little bigger but its very stretchy. Ordered large. Grey/black


Super cute and sooooooo soft! It is a little bit more snug than I was expecting, but it hugs in all the right places, so it looks good. I love that the pattern is fun and the cut is relaxed. It's super comfortable. Though it's really casual, I think it could be dressed up a little (with the right accessories). For the price, it's a great buy!


More too long than too large. I love it, but it drags on the floor. And I'm 5'7" tall. I'm going to get it shortened.


This dress is awesome, and easily worth twice as much! It is a bit long on me (I'm just about 5'4") so I knot the front, and it actually looks super cute. I'll definitely be buying another color, just can't decide which.


I had to return it and ordered a small. The small fits perfect. Beautiful dress. (I wear a medium to large)


A little to sheer for me.  Perfect for a swim cover up but I was looking for a cool throw on I could wear with my knee brace.  Very pretty though.


Gorgeous! This dress is great quality and so worth it! I love the pockets! Dressed up or down this dress is perfect. I added a belt .. Over all great purchase!
