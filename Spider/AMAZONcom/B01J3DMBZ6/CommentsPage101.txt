5'5", 130lb, xsm was perfect. Soft material, comfy. cute! love it!


Definitely baggy but comfortable


Poorly made. Uneven hem and unwearable - looks terrible on. I donated this dress.


I LOVE this dress!! Cute & comfy


This dress is da bomb! Got so many compliments! Super comfy!


Love the color, hangs really well and the material is nice and soft.


Need to return. Love it but it's way to big.


My absolute favorite amazon dress, yet!!


The fabric is soft & the color is great but the sizing is off. I read all the reviews and ordered down a size from M to S but should have ordered an extra small...


I wear an L but I purchased a M I really enjoyed wearing this dress free & comfortable
