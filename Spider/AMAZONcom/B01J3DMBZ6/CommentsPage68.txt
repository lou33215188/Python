My daughter-in-law loves it!


Comfortable lounge wear


This dress is VERY LONG! I am 5’6”and at least 4 inches drag the floor.  I guess they are made for amazons NOT average height women.


LOVE this dress! So flattering and comfortable. I am 5'7" 145 lbs and got purple size  small. Perfect fit. I will get another I am so pleased


It was a gift for my sister.  She likes it, she puts in on after work, after a bath, etc. It's like tshirt material, so she said it was lite and cool.  It has been hot.


Cute and fit great. Just received it with a hole that I had to sew up. :(


They need to inspect them before sending off.


this dress runs small, the fabric is clingy and it is not flattering


Great design and feel of fabric. Fits comfortably and chic. However, it hangs a bit crooked (more noticeable on the hanger) as it was cut more on the bias. Also a bit long without heels  for my 5'5"" height.


OMGGG do not hesitate! This lovely light weight dress fit perfectly and I cannot wait to wear it all summer long!


Love the color. Got the black with yellow streaks. The material is very thin and see through and also stretches alot over time as you wear it.
