runs very large, but paying attention to other buyers I ordered a medium, I usually wear a 14, I'm 190 & 5'7.  Fit great,  fitted at my bust 38dd my hips are 44' loose at belly and thighs. Got lots of compliments and it is very soft and comfortable,  but not see through at all.  Really love it.


This is the most comfortable thing I own, and I received 3 compliments in 1 day. Fits most accurately.


Somewhat large but sooooo comfy & cute!


I really like this.. Will be purchasing another one. Its light and airy.. the material has a light stretch. Slightly see thru


Pretty comfortable. I do not regret buying it, but I wish it were cotton.


The material is VERY see through and similar to swim suit material. Weird texture.


Love the coffee color, love the feel of the material. Wore the dress to work with brown boots, had to end up knotting the front up so I wouldn't trip. The front of the dress is a lot longer than the back. Ended up sending it back. May order another just to see if it was a defective item. Comfortable and cute though.


Surprised that it fit and that it's really long which I need!


Loved it but got kind of gross/ragged after a few washes, and stretched out. Now looks more like a moomoo.


Love this; I use as a nightgown but I’d wear outside in the summer. T-shirt like material; soft. I’d buy again
