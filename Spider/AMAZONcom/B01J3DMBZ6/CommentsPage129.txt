Great dress. Fits as expected and incredibly comfortable.


Love these dresses, causal & comfy.  I mainly just wear around the house but could easily wear to the beach over swimsuit or as  sundress.  I'm 5'6 165pds ordered a medium and it's loose and flowy, if you want a tighter fit size down.  This dress is long, it touches the floor about a inch or so on me.


Very comfy and cool.  Should have ordered a small.  I belted it and it looked cute!


Too big


it looked like a mumu


my size 13


Goood!!!


It's so cute! I got a small and I wish I sized up to a medium for an more oversized fit. I'm 5'5" and it's a little long but not so bad. I love the print and the material is so comfortable. Highly recommend!


I love this dress, however it's about 3" too long, I'm only 5'4". I will have alterations done to shorten it, no big deal (-:


I should have order a small... I tried to do with the chart but it didn't work. I tried to follow at the same time to model measurement but I got confuse ..
