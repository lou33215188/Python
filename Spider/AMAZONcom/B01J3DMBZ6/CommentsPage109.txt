went down one size and it fit great


I just love this dress! I love everything about it:-)


Too stretchy to be flattering.  OK to wear at home.


Looks like the pic and fabric is better than expected. Pockets are the only negative. Bunch a bit which isn't flattering.


I am a size 4 in dresses...about 122 lbs & 5'6". The dress I bought was a small & it's still significantly large on me. I do understand that it's supposed to be flowy but it's still a bit too big. The one reason I purchased this dress was that I wanted a 100% rayon item to take place of a dress that I have which I've worn too much that I bought from Free People. My favorite dress is 100% rayon so I bought this thinking it would be similar. This dress is rayon but not 100% so it's not as light & airy as I expected. I'm going to keep it but the description totally fooled me.


Very comfortable!


Very comfortable! Looks just like the picture, soft material


Small clingy not a fan. Sad cuz it looks like it flows more.


The dress is very comfortable. However, the white areas are completely see-through. I had to return it.


Its really lovely and the quality is good and soft.
