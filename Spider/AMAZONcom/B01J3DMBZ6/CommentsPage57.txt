Comfy and drapey, love it for lounging and also easy to dress up to go out in


I'm not into the supper baggy look but some might be! Also too long. Material is nice though and comfy.


Great fabric and long enough for tall girls. I am 5'10" and this reaches my ankles.


Super comfy, perfect for vacation or just a casual outfit. Love!


I get compliments everywhere I go when I wear this dress.


Very comfortable and can be dressed up or down!


Super soft and comfortable. I may have to get this in another color!!


quality merchandise, arrived as promised! thank you!


Love it but it's Huge!! usually wear a size 12 and A large fits like a 18.


I got a XL because I'm 5'9" and was nervous about the length but it made it so it was super wide and unflattering. I bought a belt to fake a waist and now I like it. For my athletic build and height this dress isn't just one I would throw on and go, but some bodies could I'm sure.
