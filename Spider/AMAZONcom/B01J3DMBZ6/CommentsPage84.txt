Cute, comfy, and pockets! I'm 5'4 and a medium wasn't too long for me.


love it but it was a bit bigger than expected, which makes it that much more comfy! I have received nothing but compliments on it! looks great with a jean jacket too


It does run alittle large but after reading other reviews I ordered a size down, I usually buy a medium because I don't like my clothes tight, but I ordered a small and it fit perfect.


I am tall but thin 5'10" 145 lb so I got a large bc I didn't want it to be short. Loose but that's the look. I could have probably gone with a medium.  Love it!


Fit as expected. Green was not green but grey. Returned.


Product does not look like the picture! Rough, unflattering material. I ordered the coffee/white colored one but it's black/white. Do not recommend!


Very comfy & can be worn with different looks!  Would buy again ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


I would buy one in every color! This dress is all perfect!


Note: if you like tight clothing, order a size smaller. This is a loose-fitting dress.


Had to return because even the smallest size was much too large. Normally wear XS or S depending on brand.


It has pockets!
