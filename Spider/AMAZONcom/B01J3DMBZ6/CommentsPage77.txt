Wore this with a short white cardigan to school today.  I received many compliments on the shape and slimming feature.  The material is soft and extremely comfortable.  I haven't washed it yet, but hopefully it will hold up as this will be my go to easy slip on dress.


LOVE!! Very comfortable! Adorable


I am 115lbs, 5'4", ordered an XS, fits great maybe a little loose but that is the style of the dress! Also it is long but that's no problem with me!


Love, love, love!  You won't be disappointed.


Cozy, fits perfect, and flattering!


love this dress.....very stylish especially for the price!


I ordered a small and it's still a little too big. I am normally a M/L.


Great dress and fits good


Best dress ever! So comfy and got soooo many compliments!


LOVE!  The softest, most cozy dress.  It does drape a bit long at the center hem, but I just ties a side know and it looks super cool.  I might get a size smaller next time.  Gonna order it in more colors!
