Way to large canâ€™t even wear it


One of my favorite dresses!


Not that attractive


great dress for day.  Comfy and interesting looking.  Reasonable price.  Happy with this purchase.


So happy with the fit and with the POCKETS!!


Love!!! 5'8" 135lbs ordered small


It was a bit big, but really nice casual dress.


Really cute design but the material is very thin and runs smaller than what I expected.


Very comfortable dress! Used as a cover up in Mexico.


Go smaller on this.
