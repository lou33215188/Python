really nice, the fit is perfect, love the color


Cute and comfortable


I love this dress! It is a jersey knit like your most comfortable tee shirt, thin but not see through. Cool and comfortable, nice drape. Dress it up or dress it down. I loved it so much I immediately ordered 2 more. What else can I say? I'm in my 50's, go back and forth between a 16 and an 18 and I am at the 18 end of that now, ordered a large and it fit great. I'm 5'8" and the length is good too. Great, comfy, good looking, casual, summer dress. Hippie Bohemian chic!  : )


Love, Love, Love


Nice dress. Very comfy


This is a great dress, but just not for me. I saw how cute all the other reviewers looked in it and thought I might look just as cute, but sadly, I looked like hot garbage in this thing. The material is nice, very soft, like a jersey material, and very comfortable. My only complaint is that it was much darker than pictured, but I guess with a name like coffee one could expect that the dress would be a darker brown. All in all, a great, lightweight summer dress for someone else. I returned.


Comfortable


I absolutely love this dress.  It will definitely be a staple in my summer dress collection.  I love maxi dresses because I am tall and mini dresses seem to only be shorter - and this is perfect.


Exactly as it appears in the photos.  I used it as a beach coverup and received numerous compliments.  One caveat: this dress is very, very long.  I am 5'10" and it grazed the ground unless I wore 2 inch heels.  Nevertheless, I love the dress.


Super comfy
