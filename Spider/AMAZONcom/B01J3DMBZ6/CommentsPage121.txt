I love my dress !


Love this dress, very casual or you can dress it up!


Love this dress, have teo will order other 3 colors!!


Very soft material and has pockets!


I ordered a coffee in medium and expected it to be loose and long, but it was dragging on the floor like a wedding dress (I'm 5'6") in front and the back. The pattern I got was also a little off. I had also ordered a dark green one in medium, but the length of the green dress was perfect landing just above my feet at the ankles.  So I'm returning the coffee and ordering another hoping the next one will be a better color and length.


Otherwise, It is exactly as pictured....loose with pockets.  Just the quality control is not there.  But it's free returns, so if you don't mind ordering it until you get the one that you like, go for it.


Very flattering


Very cute lots of versatility


Love this dress.
