Super Cute Fit!


Make sure you check sizing.


LOVE! It's light weight but not see through & you can't see panty line...but very light & soft. Seriously the most comfortable thing ever. I bought the tan & the blue & have received multiple compliments on both. Also, pockets. Will buy other colors!!


kinda wonky seams, goes sideways. ok for wearing about the house, comfy roomy.


Buy this dress, you will not regret it. I did size down after reading reviews. 5'6" 165lbs 38DD, medium fits perfectly.


Awesome print. Easy fit.  Super soft. Love!


This dress came so fast and looked great! I am 170 lbs & 5 months pregnant and the large was still loose on me and looked great!


This was waaaay too big and a little too "Stevie Nicks" for me. I ordered a small and am 5'7"/150 lbs. I was swimming in fabric.


Beautiful color & super soft, slinky material.  The length is a bit long, but with a belt or heels just right. Loose fitting as expected,  very pleased with this dress!


This is too big and I ordered a small!  The sizing is way off on these dresses/shirts, I thought I was getting sundresses and received Ill-fitting shirts (?)
