Kind of long for me being 5’4” but I love it overall!


I do love the length though and the feel of the fabric


Terrible product and had a hole in it.


Will buy in other colors


Love the dress. Fits perfect, but long. I am short.


Great dress to throw on and go. Doesn't wrinkle! I will be buying another one this week.


Really loved it, but too large! If you wear a small this is more like a medium.


Super comfortable and adorable. I'll be wearing this all summer and will order in more colors :)


Even though I purchased the extra small it was like a tent on me


I am buying this is like 3 different styles! Love it!
