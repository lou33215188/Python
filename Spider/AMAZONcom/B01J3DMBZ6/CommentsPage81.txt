Exactly as it says. This dress is great for thinner and curvier girls. I love mine!


Really cute dress. I ordered a size too big. Definitely fits true to size. Fortunately I was able to get my sister to tailor a bit for me.. so the pockets wouldn't be at my knees.


I ordered a medium, it fits perfect. I'm 5'3 and 6 months pregnant lol so I weigh about 160 ish right now, Its comfortable and loose enough. my before weight is around 140ish so im hopping its not too big. love the dress though.


loved it - a little long but good for tying in know


Great for casual occasions where you want to look nice.


5'7" -  156 lbs ordered a medium.  Runs a little big but I love it.


a little big I should have gotten a M but because it is made of good material I kept it. I love the way it flows and hangs well nice vibrant color as well! thumbs up for this dress


I would size down on this. It also stretches out while you wear it.


When It arrived it reeked of cigarette smoke and was shorter than expected. I waited almost a month for arrival, the return process wouldn't be worth the trouble.


I love it! Fits great and comfortable. It can be dressed up or down.
