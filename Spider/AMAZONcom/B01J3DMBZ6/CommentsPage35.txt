Very cute and comfortable, washes well.  I knocked it a star because it's a tiny bit transparent.  Otherwise, it's great!


It's cute, but not form flattering. I'm 5'7 130 lbs and it is too short. I won't be wearing this.


Fit comfortably and seems pretty true to size.  I was super happy about the pockets!


Disappointed in the fit of the dress. I realize it is a flowly loose style but even the small was massive on my 5'7 medium build frame. It was so long I step on it. This will sadly never be worn.


I am 5 foot two it runs a little long but that's all I did was trim the bottom month it does not row when you cut it ,


it hangs nicely very flattering on the body .


its a bit large but thats what i wanted  i didn't want it to be fitted. I love wearing it in the evening to relax in.. its very soft and comfortable!!


I absolutely love this dress! I could've definitely ordered a size down, I bought an XL. Can't wait to wear it out.....


Such a cute and comfortable dress. Dress it up park keep it casual. So comfy!


Nice dress! It's soft, comfy and made well. Bought for a bathing suit cover so the fit is good for that. To wear as a dress though, I'd drop a size.


This is the 2nd one I have bought. Perfect for work & so comfortable.  Do go a size down though.  I'm normally a large & fit in the medium perfectly!
