Love this dress....very comfy!


love this dress!! It's a comfy causal fit but I added a belt and its perfect!! already got compliments!!


Material is thicker than expected.


I purchased this dress for a friend after purchasing one for myself.  It is the perfect summer maxi dress that is comfortable and fashionable.


It was blue not purple but super comfy


Just a little long but I am short 5-2.


I bought two of these -- a medium for my sister and an extra large for myself -- and there is no difference at all in the size.


Great fit, flattering shape. The stretchy jersey fabric is very comfortable but also a little transparent.


I wanted to love this.  It's a cute pattern and the material is really nice and comfy.  It would be great to just throw on and go.  Unfortunately, it was a little more loose and flowy through the torso than I wanted.  I'm 5'5' and 135 lbs and got an extra small (which is 1-2 sizes down for me).  I could have overlooked that, but it was dragging on the floor.  Even with a pair of 2-3 inch wedges it was still grazing the floor.  It's not like I'm that short so I'm surprised there aren't more comments about this.  Had to send it back.


It's cute
