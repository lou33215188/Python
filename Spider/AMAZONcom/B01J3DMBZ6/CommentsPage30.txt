5'4" and got an XS but it still hits the ground. Wish it fit better because i love it and its comfortable... still undecided if I should keep it because I could only wear it with heels.


I like the dress except for it being too long and it had a hole in one of the pockets. The pocket can be fixed and I can have it shortened.


Read the reviews...if you are long and slim you will love this. If you are short, a sewing machine is in your future.


Very cute.  I generally wear an extra large but bought the medium based on the reviews and it was a  great fit.  I bought a second dress in a small as I've lost about 20 lbs and it fits great as well.


I really wanted to love this dress, however, the pockets didn't lay flat even after ironing. They bulged out at the hips and added an extra 5 pounds on each leg. I see this in other reviewers posts who love the dress so maybe I am the only one who is self-conscious about their hips! The fabric was slinky yet thick and I loved the pattern. The fit just wasn't cute.


Fabric was soft and look beautiful,  but the fit was way to large for me the pockets were at my knees


I would have rated this 5 if it was not made for a 6 foot woman.  I had to hem it.  I am 5’4” and was stepping on it.


Love it! Ordered a M and fits loose still I usually wear L. I feel like it needs a slip so I wear a short one underneath.


Very cute and comfortable, sizing is accurate. Does run very long. Great to wear as beach cover-up. Material is very thin, if wearing as a dress, appropriate undergarments are required.


This a beautiful beach kind of dress but it is for tall people. I got a medium and I am very medium at 5'5" 140 lbs. it drug on the floor so I couldn't wear it. Had to return.
