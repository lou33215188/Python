Good quality, and well made.


Too long.


This dress is everything and more. The fabric is super soft and light weight, the pattern is exactly how it's pictured, the fit is great. I am 5 6' and the medium hits the top of my feet (it might be long if you are shorter), the slits aren't too high cut. I haven't washed it but so far it's the perfect dress.


Cute and comfy to wear. I am on the shorter side (5'2") so I have to tie the bottoms up in a knot.


Love it


Very soft and comfortable.
