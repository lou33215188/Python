Summer fun, 5'7",  and in 1 1/2 " heels does not drag the ground. The material is the perfect weight


Made so large, not true to size, so cheaply made already had a rip when it arrived. Very disappointed.


I absolutely love this dress! The material is great and doesn't feel cheap. I'm 5' 8'' and the length is perfect when wearing flats. I want to buy this dress in every color


Just ugly!


Super cute and comfortable. I wear it around the house when it's hot outside, but you could wear it out casually. Just bought another one in another color.


I misread and thought it was gauze... I’m not in love with it, I’ll wear as pajamas. Pockets are very pronounced and I’m going to take out, they are too obvious on hips. For the price it was fine... I read to go lower in size, but it really shows every bump on my booty...


I am 5ft 3in and it drags on the ground about 4 inches


I love my new summer run around dress, love it!


Super cute casual dress.  I am 5'7" and weigh 150 pounds and the S fit me perfectly.  I don't like things too fit me tight and this dress hung nicely and did not cling to any of my problem areas but also does not look frumpy.


I'm 5'2" 115lbs, bought a size small and could not be happier with this dress! It's a little long, but great with heels. It's incredibly soft and comfortable and surprisingly flattering in the way that it lays in the back. High quality, awesome price, very happy with my purchase.
