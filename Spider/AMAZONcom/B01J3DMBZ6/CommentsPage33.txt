This dress surprised me. It is well-made with very comfortable fabric and not see-through at all.


Love this dress. So comfortable and versatile. I wear it all the time at my sons school and for date nights with a cute hat. Love it.


beautiful print and nice material. Extremely long. Made for a giraffe tall. I am 5'3 and 125 lbs. ordered a small size. It was comfortable but with 4"  heels it dragged more than 12 inches. I tried the length on my 6'2 ft tall husband,  a perfect fit. Unless you are model size 5'9 or taller this dress is not for you.


Medium weight t-shirt material, nice and long, full coverage. The black and gold is beautiful! Wish it had pockets.


A little lopsided .. one leg shows like crazy. pocket hangs below leg slit opening, I sewed it down further  to keep it all covered.


It's a little bigger than I expected it to be, but it still fits! And it's super soft!!


It’s cute but definitely runs big, also the v neck line hemming looks cheap. I’m going to try and shrink it. It is very long which works great for me as I’m 5’8 and want to wear boots.. However prob wouldn’t work for petite girls. I forgot I ordered this previously in a different color in a size small and it was huge, looked like a moo moo. Saved for a night gown


doesn't seem long enough and the color shows all flaws. sad it didn't work out. But the dress worked out great for my skinny short friend.


Ordered a Small - it was HUGE & Very Long ( might have. Even mismarked as appeared to fit more like a large


Cheap thin slippery polyester material


Material is too clingy and showed more of my muffin tip than I like.  Was too long.
