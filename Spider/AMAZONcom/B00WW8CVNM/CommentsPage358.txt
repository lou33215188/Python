One my new favorite dresses


didn't use it for the event, but it's hanging in the closet.


great


Very cute sandal. Love it!! It is a very soft pink and can be neutral  to wear with a lot of things.


Dress looked just as discribed and the quality was good! I would recommend if you want to wear something pretty for a special occasion :)


I love vintage 1950s style dresses but they are so expensive! I bought this one on a whim and hoped it would be good quality for a special event coming up. It was above and beyond my expectations! So happy I got this. I received many compliments when I wore it out. Looks great with the perfect heel.


Cheap material


cheap


Most of the Sunny Fashion Girl Dresses were yet and some damage


Amazing dress. Being bigger on top I was a little nervous but the large was a perfect fit.
