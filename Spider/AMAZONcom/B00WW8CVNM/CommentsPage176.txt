It fits nice and has modest length. However, the zipper at the back only zips half way and gets stuck at the top. I dont know if it Wrinkles easily cuz I just got it today. But other than that it's pretty nice.

I absolutely LOVE this dress and get SO many compliments on it. I have ordered a couple dresses from Acevog and they have not disappointed. I'm a full, curvy lady and this dress is perfect. Thank you!


It fits perfectly but all you have to do is sit in it and it'll wrinkle.


does need to be ironed, but is a fun dress!


Cute dress; just really, really fitted....thought it would have a little more "give" too!


The material is slightly stretchy giving a wonderful fit and feel . The pattern and colors are wonderful.
