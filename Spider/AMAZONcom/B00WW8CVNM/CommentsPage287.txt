Looked great at a wedding I wore it to with the petticoat. It flared perfectly and flowed when the wind caught it. Absolutely love it


This is now one of my favorite dresses to wear!!!!


The sizing is off, way too small.  Bummer.  Hopefully my daughter can wear it because it is a completely gorgeous dress.


awesome dress for the price. I am skeptical about buying clothing online, but I read previous reviews, and took a chance, I'm glad I did!


It was a little tight around my chest. It is pretty but I would like to try another print.


Love this dress!! Feel super girlie and cute in it! Personally not a big flower lover but this one works in all the right ways ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼ğŸ‘¯


Beautiful dress, little big in the bust, but fit perfectly everywhere else!


I feel beautiful in this dress.


Stitching a bit too large


its pretty but too small for the size it said
