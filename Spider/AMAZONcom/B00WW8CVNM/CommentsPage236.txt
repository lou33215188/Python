Poor quality and two sizes to big. At least the return was completed hassle free.


Zero star


I didn't like the high waist of this dress which didn't see in the picture !!!!!


I will return it back


Perfect feminine comfortable easy to wear dress. Great for work or other events - can be dressed up.


Beatific dress my daughter loves it


I'm 5'1, size 7,  this dress fit perfect. The material is tough to iron. I recommend a quick wash then iron.


Very cute....I love it and it's  a very good buy


I was really worried about it fitting me when ordered after looking at all the comments but, it fit like a glove! I got the 3x and I tend to usually wear about a 20 in dresses. Looks great on all sizes!


Very nice for my daugther.


the top fits extremely small......am sending it back


The dress fits beautifully.
