Fanastic! Fit perfect!  Quality made.


Take note ladies I love this dress. only drawback is I'm tall and the dress hits a little high above my knees but with a crinoline peaking out it's perfect ğŸ˜�


The dress is too long. It not how it looks on the picture


Material not very high quality and dress was longer than I expected.


FIT AS EXPECTED


Beautiful but too small. Fits my friend who wears a size ten to twelve.


just didn't fit right


Fits great and very breathable fabric perfect for summer. I am 132lbs and I am 5.4" tall my measurements are 35 bust, 28 waist. The length of the dress is right below the knee, which is perfect.


It was beautiful just ran a little small. I exchanged it for the next size.


So cute! Fits perfect and the length is Great! With the longer waistband/top, it can be lengthened or shortened.
