Very upset as the zipper broke the first time of trying it on! Not well made, but thankfully I am a seamstress and wil fix it as it is cute.


Pretty neat. The color is a little more tan than pink, and it's a little big around the collar and waist. Otherwise, nice!


It is a very pretty dress and it fitted perfectly!

Cute dress too small I ordered large i wear a14 gave to my daughter looks like a size 10


The dress was very pretty. It was just a tad bit to small around the bust.


Perfect fit.


Very flattering for my shape


Nice dress but the material is not of good quality. Love the way it fits and looks.


Loved the dress and fit everywhere except the chest, if your big up top need to go size larger, so my daughter gets a new dress
