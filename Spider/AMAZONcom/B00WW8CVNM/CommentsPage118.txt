This dress is lovely, however the size was way off. It seemed like it was one size at the waist and a much smaller size on top.


Good product. Did not look the way I expected. However, I think that was more a result of my own lack of foresight than of the product itself though.


Fantastic fit and quality! Very flattering, a little longer than I expected, but I absolutely love it. Will definitely order another. :)


All i can say is wow.. this dress is awesome.. the colors are bold and beautiful.


This is the second dress I bought as I had to go up a size for the top to fit me. (40j). I did read the reviews and saw that others were able to wear a 2xl so I thought,I would try it.  Did not fit.  This one does fit me well but it is now just longer then what I wanted so going to have it hemmed.


beautiful dress! fit as expected i ordered Large 5'6" 170lbs.


Ive gotten so many compliments every time I wear this dress.  Truly like it. It fit perfectly; maybe just a bit big on the chest area but not too big of a deal


I read all the reviews as to sizing and even ordered 2 sizes bigger so I could have it altered. It was WAY to small. Otherwise the colour was great and it seems very well made. I will be reordering a new size.


Fabulous fit. I'm typically a size 8/10 depending on make and this size was perfect for my curvy 5'4" figure. Love it!


Love the dress. Is certainty a head Turner. It gives the sexy vibe without showing too much. Very classy
