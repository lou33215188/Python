Be careful purchasing correct size. I am 5'3 140 lbs and wear medium-sized dresses. I ordered this dress in size L and there was no way I was fitting in it. I'd probably need an XXL to get correct sizing. Cute dress. Came from China so impossible to return or get a proper refund. Disappointing.


Had to return it. But it looked nice.


I am going to buy this is numerous colors, it is so cute and fits great!


I'm 5'5 & 200 pounds. I ordered an XL.  I love this dress. I  received  so many  complements on it!  I wore mine with a white petticoat underneath.


Honestly, I'm not sure if it is 'somewhat small' because the quality of the material was so poor and misleading from the description that I immediately returned it.


Pretty party dress. Fit very nice. Definitely a conversation piece!


The picture of this dress makes it look like it has a nice long torso which is important for me since I am 6'. When I got the dress I quickly realize that the picture must be streched because the 'waist' fits halfway down my ribcage and makes me look very strange. The fit everywhere else was as expected but I sadly can't wear this dress at all. Very dissapointed.


Its a beautiful dress but a lil scratchy. Its cotton but not very soft. Other than that its a nice dress.


I am a size 16 l ordered a 3XL with 40D cup I didn't have any problems. I am proportionate with a small muffin top however that's nothing a light girdle can't fix (tehehehe) ğŸ˜‰


Ridiculously small sizing.  If I were a petite asian lady this might fit. I am not.
