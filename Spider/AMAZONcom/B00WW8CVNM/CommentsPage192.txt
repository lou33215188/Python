Snug but cute.  I've received numerous compliments


This is a great casual dress. The top has a bit of stretch, and the fabric on the bottom reminds me of that used for men's outdoor shirts. The only problem with that fabric being thick and soft is that it can cause a sticking point for the zipper at the waistband where there are more layers of fabric (even when the dress is simply hanging on the hanger). You should have seen me trying to get this on. I was by myself, and trying to zip past that point behind my back wasn't working. The problem is, you can't zip it up first and then try to pull it on, because the waist is true-to-fit enough that you can't get it over your shoulders or hips if it's already zipped. I finally had to put the dress on, spin it around backwards, wrestle the zipper past the waistband, spin it back around, stick my arms though the holes, and then zip the rest of the way. Whew! Once zipped up its comfortable and super cute though - enough that its worth keeping even with all the swearing involved in putting it on.


Love it. Feel so very feminine and flirty!


Too small.  Not for tall women with low waist.  Waist was almost under breasts.


This dress is beautiful! The red and black combination has a little more grey than I anticipated but it will be great for an evening summer wedding. I'm usually a medium/large and I ordered a large and it fit perfectly!


Lovely!  The dress is quite flattering.  I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it..


She loved it


The dress fit perfectly! I'm 5'7 with a 37 bust, 32 waist, and 37 hips and I ordered a large. The dress came 10 days after I ordered it and I'm very impressed. I like the material, and the stitching isn't the absolute best but will last awhile. Overall, a very good dress!


I ordered this a size bigger and it's still too small.


Nowhere near a 2X- I had to return, fortunately I have Prime so it was hassle free.  Beware.....order waaaay up!!!
