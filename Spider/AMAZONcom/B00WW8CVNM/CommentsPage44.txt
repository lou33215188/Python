Ordered this for my 14 year old daughter to wear for a performance where she needed a swing dress. She is a large cup size A, small B, and the chest gaped a tiny bit. We ordered a size small, which fit her perfectly everywhere else. (She is 5'3" and an adult size XS/S or 2/4.) Was not a huge deal-breaker though. Since the dress has a tie for the waist to cinch it up a bit, go a tad larger if you are her size but have a larger chest! But she loved it and it is super duper cute. She got the black with white polka dots, and I think she will be able to use it for all sorts of occasions.


Size 16 ordered XXL and fit nicely. Only three stars because its going back. Felt a little frumpy on, maybe the below knee length, or fabric. Seems like something you would find at JC Penney. By the reviews I can see a lot of women love this dress and I had hoped to as well. Maybe the fullness just wasnt flattering to my pear shaped body and larger hips.


The dress fit was perfect.  Loved the style and cut so much, we ordered a second one.  Finally had the opportunity to wear it to an event two weeks after the return window had passed and before I got down from the vehicle, the zipper had come apart.  No saving this one.  Will try to email vendor to see if they would work with me.


 


I loved the dress, it came faster then expected. However I ordered a similar dress two years ago and that dress had a thicker fabric. I still feel the quality but still. In addition I'm about 200 pounds and i ordered a 2x but i think i could have gotten an xl just fine because i dont have much boobs.


I LOVE this dress. Sodt stretchy cotton feel.


I wear a size 16w so I ordered the 3xl and it fits perfectly.


I don't like ties in the back so I ties it to the front and to the side. Compliments my curves and my yummy tummiesğŸ˜Š


Got tons of compliments! I love it so much I ordered the green one. I wish I could afford to buy them all.


Once u buy one u will buy another.


Just wish it had pockets!


My favorite dress!!


I got the cherry-print dress. Ordered 6/7, shipped from China on 6/8, received in AZ on 6/17. WOW! Dress has ties at the waist to tie in the back. At 5'8" and 175, the XL fits perfectly but still loose and falls just below my knees. Quality fabric and stitching, and zipper in the middle of the back from waist to neck. I'll be ordering more!


So  I am typically a size large in women's clothing if the clothes are from stores for example like Target. So with everyones advice in mind I order an XL which turned out to fit me like a glove. I am 5'5 154 pounds and an XL fits me just right.


The dress seems to be decent quality, the dress came fast and was packaged well. Over all I would order more dresses of the same kind.


This dress is beautiful and fits so nicely.  I am a size 14 (5.3, 165 lbs) and I ordered the XL.  I like how it flows and the pattern is gorgeous!  I bought the purple floral and the black with red flowers.  The black one was a bit longer, but just as pretty.  They shrunk a bit when washed.


Absolutely perfect fit. I was shocked that it fit so well because I am a lot smaller on top than a medium allows for. the material is a little stretchy which is perfect for my waist. I'm 5'2'' and length was about mid calf with the petticoat. When I don't use the petticoat, it is just s little longer. I love wearing it with and without petticoat. Different looks!


I did have to iron it the first time and the material isn't the most quality, so I'm not going to wash it in water, but for 20$, I am not complaining. I get many many compliments. Wore it for a wedding and was the only one who did not have a a prom or a club look. I very much loved looking unique.


5'8", 36DD, normally wear a med/large. I ordered an XL and fits PERFECTLY. Comes down to just above my knee.  Definitely order a size up. I got the blue and its slightly darker than in the picture, but absolutely gorgeous and flattering. I love it!!!
