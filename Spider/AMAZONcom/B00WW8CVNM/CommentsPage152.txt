These dress is beautiful and a perfect fit! Great delivery too


I love it!


Came with a hole in the seam on the front of stress.


it is a lot longer than I thought it would be. I will have to cut some of it off and re-hem it. Other than that it is perfect! :)


Definitely order a size or two larger. It's Asian sizing. But the dress is great looking. Looks even better with a petticoat.


First time buyer. I'm 5'11 and about 130 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits so perfectly that I ordered another as soon as I tried it on!  I received a ton of compliments at our usual Sunday brunch.
