This is such a pretty dress and it fits wonderfully. I received so many flattering compliments. I will be purchasing a couple more.


Nice color pattern, you can dress it up or down


Sizing chart allowed me to get a perfect fit! Great summer dress. Ideal for any occasion. Quality far better than expected since the price was so low!


It fit well and I received a lot of compliments at my sister's bridal shower. I loved it, my only complaint is that the zipper is a little flimsy.


I sized up from a med to large. Usually wear 8or 10.  Fits good


did not fit my body the way I thought it would.


Love the dress good length but do get it one size bigger.


Zipper broke as I was ironing, very very thin material; fits small. Not happy


Love this dress!  Fit is just as described in their size chart.  Ordering more colors.  Shipping was faster than expected.


I ordered a large because I'd rather take it in then have it be to small. My daughter wears a medium, I got a large and it fits perfectly. So order a size bigger than what you'd normally get.
