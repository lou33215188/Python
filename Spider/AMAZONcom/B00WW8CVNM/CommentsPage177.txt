Super cute, nice fabric, not the best dress I've bought... but the best for the price!!


well made, very stylish, nice fabric, just a wee bit large.


Really great and cute dress, but I am too busty to wear the size that goes with my waist size.


Pretty dress. Fits perfectly. Love it!


Pretty, nice fit and love that it is long enough for my 5' 8" daughter.


Fabric smelled funny.  fit was too small and long


Took a long time for shipping, but the dress was perfect.


Perfect


loved it


The dress was exactly as they explained it. I almost got a bigger size, worries of how their sizing fit. But I'm glad I didnt. I'm very satisfied!!
