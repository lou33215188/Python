Love it! I've gotten so many compliments on this dress. I have one more in the same style and plan on buying some of the other prints.


It is a gorgeous dress. Some stitching around the waist was coming undone but it was an easy fix. I would gladly buy another dress from them.


Very pretty but seeing as I'm busty my boobs don't fit well in it


A bit to long bit really cute dress n worth the money


Love that it was the perfect size. Comfortable, I get lots of compliments. Will be buying a few more at a later time.


I ordered the same size as the other two dresses and I can't even get it zipped, runs really small


Small in the chest area!  But very pretty otherwise


Poorly made.  Seams unraveling.  Will not EVER buy from this vendor.


I love the dress, I did order a size up as it did fit somewhat small in the top. Flair of the skirt is wonderful!


Love this dress!!
