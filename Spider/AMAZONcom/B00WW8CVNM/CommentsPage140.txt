This dress is a must have I liked it so much I ordered two more in different colors it fits perfectly I swear I didn't want to take it off it's a great dress to have


Lovely!


This is very flattering on.


Wow this was dissatisfing . Too big and not the same as picture and material is stiff and rough terrible


This is an adorable summer dress.  Classy and enough retro that it gets a double take... plus it's flattering!  Will be ordering other colors and prints.


Wow, did this sucker shrink! Washed in cold and air dried and it shrunk a couple sizes.


I read that the dress ran small and to order a size up.  I did but I think I should have ordered 2 sizes up.  I got it on but couldn't zip it.  Besides it  being small, I noticed there were loose threads in a few areas of the dress.  Had to find a dress I wore before for Easter.


Love this dress, great quality for the price.  The red and black colors are so pretty, can't wait to wear it.


It was somewhat small for me.  I was lucky my daughter can fit it so I didn't have to send back. Nice dress though, and delivery timing was good.


After reading the reviews I ordered a size bigger than normal and it fits great! Very flattering. The only thing I don't like is it's hand wash only..
