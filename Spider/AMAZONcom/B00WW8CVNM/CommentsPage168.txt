very fun


Chinese sizing.. 2x=M in real life I think


This dress is beautiful! I am 180 and the XL fits perfectly. I received many compliments on the dress at my bridal shower. I felt beautiful in the dress and it is very flattering!


GF loves it but it was a little too mall. Good quality though!


Not quite what I expected, but it's always a crap shoot with Amazon clothes. I can get this tailored and it would probably be ok. Just a little too big and long, and kind of funky rolled neckline.


Absolutely beautiful. Love the fit, color and fabric.


Beautiful dress but a little long for me.Wear as a summer dress.


Fit just right. And is made very beautifully! SO happy I own it.


This is a great dress. Good price, good material, looked very good on.


i am very long waisted, so the dress fits a bit weird in the top, with the tie higher then my waist. but I run into that with almost all dresses with this sort of tie.


good value, and still super cute.
