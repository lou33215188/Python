Perfect for, well made. Love it. Fits a bit snug


daughter didn't much like the fit


Very pretty and good quality.  A nice retro dress, perfect for a petticoat.


Cute, has high cute so not much waist definiation


This is a really nice dress. I have never bought clothes on Amazon before and was very worried. I actually bought this for a Halloween costume but when it arrived and I tried it on I decided to wear it to work the next day. Only downfall of this dress is that it is very wrinkly. It fits pretty much true to size.


Beautiful and we'll made and fits like a glove


Very plain. I'm a size 10 and a large fit good. 5'8", 34B. It was snug but comfortable, little stretchy. Def need a petticoat for fullness. content://media/external/file/2478


I had to order 3 sizes bigger than I am in the US size chart and the dress was still snug....no more!


IT FITS LIKE 5 sizes smaller . But super cute


The fabric is really poor quality.  This looks like a cheap sheet.  A shame because it looks really cute on the screen. Returned it.
