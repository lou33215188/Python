Nice fit, looks gorgeous... material is thin and breathable.


I have received a lot of compliments on this dress! I also wore it for a vintage photo shoot.


Came super quick and size was perfect


Everything was great but the sizing.


I wear a large but the bust area was to small.


I LOVE this dress and received so many compliments when I wore it to church. I'm a size 12,so I ordered it in a XL and it fit perfect.

I love the dress but had I know it came from China, I would not have order it. I see that our sizes don't match up. I don't know how to return it.
