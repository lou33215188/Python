Great fit, nice fabric. I'm buying more.


Not what was pictured, returned


two sizes smaller than expected. Had to give it away.


Well made, amazing fit, comfortable material, great price


way to long but was very nice dress and it was very easy to fix buy cutting and sewing or tucking in


I am 5'1 and it fit me perfect


Armpits are small


Luv it!


Lovely dress. I'm 5' 2" and bought a large. Fits very well.
