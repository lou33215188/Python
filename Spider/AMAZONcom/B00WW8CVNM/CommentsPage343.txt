Excellent


Tighter in the chest then I expected.


Fabric is also a little thin


Exact fit!


I ordered up to fit my most problematic area (my bust) now the waist is much too large. So I ordered a wide cincher belt to gib with this dress. It should solve the issue.


Just a warning you go full Marilyn Monroe in the wind in this boy so wear under clothes! I had a total wardrobe malfunction getting out of the car on a windy day. Oops.


Love it


Nice dress!!


Fit like a glove!


I wear size 4 but the medium size dress I ordered was too small.


For the price, this really can't be beat. My measurements are 36 DD/31/42 and a size large was just slightly big but I bought it that way so when I wash it will shrink a bit. The only issue I have right off the bat is that the top is a bit short so the waistband of the skirt doesn't sit on the natural waist. I am quite short at 5'3" and with a short torso and I can imagine on anyone with a longer torso would find it quite irritating. The skirt is a heavier material which is nice and also stretchy though it doesn't quite flow as a lighter material would.


But I love the style regardless... a beautiful dress.
