A little small but looks nice


I liked the style but dress wasn't quality fabric..


The dress is beautiful on, the zipper is super cheap though and I had to replace it after the third wear.


Very pretty. Stretchy


absolutely a gorgeous dress. nice quality


Beautiful, and constructed well!


Great dress!! I'm a plus size 16-18 and sometimes 20 5'10 kinda chick. The dress has some give and ubber comfortable! Black petticoat under it and you're done! I also got it in blue and can't wait tomrocknit at a wedding in a few weeks!


Sizes run at least 2-3 sizes too small. Very disappointed.


I have received so many compliments wearing this dress - make sure to get a petticoat with this and you'll be the bell of the ball!


This fits perfectly to my body. I am 5ft 2", 120lbs so I chose size medium, great choice.
