I bought this dress in green about two months ago, and I am absolutely in love with it. I accidentally shrank it, however, and would love and appreciate it if Amazon would bring this back so I can purchase several more. I cannot find anything close to the dress I bought, and am missing it terribly.


I wear a size 12. I ordered this in a large & it's very tight. I'm giving it to my sister. I do love the color. I'm going to order another in a size x large.


A little odd shaped for curves


Bought for my 5'10" daughter, she looks great in it, just the right length and fit! Not to mention it's a cute dress!


Fit was great, and the high waist hides a multitude of sins :-) - (meaning extra weight in the belly area if you have it).  I was disappointed that the skirt was not fuller, but other than that, I am very satisfied.  Will purchase more in the future.


Good quality of dress . Purchased it for my mom 165 lbs 5'4 it fits perfect .I would recommend it to anyone .


beautiful dress. Was small despite me ordering a 2xl it was more like a large I wear a xl (14-16). gave it to my niece as a gift She loved it!


My granddaughter looks absolutely beautiful in this dress! Love the design and fits to size.


I loved this dress so much I bought 3 more in other colors. I am a 16/18 and the 2X fits perfectly. The lightweight but slightly stiff fabric smooths over lumpy areas nicely.


LOVE this dress! Great quality. Stretch in the fabric to fit your "curves". Adorable. I am buying another one in another color.
