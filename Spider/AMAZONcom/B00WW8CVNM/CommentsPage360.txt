Not what I expected.


ok


Uber cute, and form fitting.  I bought a size larger than I normally wear, and glad I did.  The larger size fits me like it was made for me.


The dress is very nice too quality great length. The only problem I had was the size. Other than that it was a beautiful dress. I'll definitely be buying from this seller again.


Way too small.  Disappointed as I used the size chart for accuracy.  Felt tight and choking.


Cute dress but way to small...I needed a 2XL and I got XXL.


Not as cute as in the picture but fine for an informal event


cute


The quality of this dress is great. However, I used their sizing chart and it arrived was too small. If you have any chest at all expect this dress to be to small for you. They do not expect women to have breasts. So disappointed by this purchase. Comment for the seller, learn what women's body's are shaped like.


I love the dress, but I thought "tea length" is suppose to go below the knee. I am not a tall person but.....
