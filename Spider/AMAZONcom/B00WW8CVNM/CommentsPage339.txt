This dress should NEVER have left the facility!! The dress I received was in such terrible condition that I resorted to holding my breath while handling for fear of getting sick!! The damage and MOLD, yes MOLD, can clearly be seen through the package!! I had ordered for a tea party bridal shower. EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED!!
