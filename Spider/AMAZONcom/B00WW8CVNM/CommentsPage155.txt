Too small and fabric looks cheap. Took six week for delivery.


This vintage dress was a hit at a cocktail gathering I attended. I paired the dress with rose gold accessories. Perfect!


Bought this for myself in a 26. I usually wear a 22. Came no where near zipping up. My daughter that wears a 16/18 put it on.... Fits PERFECTLY! !!!! Sizing is way off but it looks so beautiful on her!!!


Weird cut. Unflattering fit


Ordered a small but it was a bit too big. Thankfully my mother sews and she made the adjustments for me. Otherwise, its made of proper material, not thin and sewn neatly. Would recommend


LOVE THE DRESS BUT IT RAN SMALL. GIVING IT TO MY DAUGHTER. ITS REALLY CUTE. ZIPPER CATCHES ON MATERIAL


Really cute dress for a great price I recommend this dress!


Cute dress, but the top part was very small. I'm large breasted however there was no give in the fabric at all.


I LOVE my DRESS. SHE IS SO "RETRO SEXY" I plan to order more!!


Fit is good.  Pretty print.....will see next summer how it holds up without starch.
