I love my dress! I got a ton of compliments. It fits like a glove.


Its very nice. Size runs small.


Love the fit.Wlii be wearing it soon


Love the cherry print. The fabric is a bit stiff but breathable. The only issues I have with this item is that the neckline/shoulder area is oddly fitted - it's wide and gaps a bit. The waist ties are also not really as long as I'd like (it looks like perhaps the same waist ties have been used on all sizes of the dress). You will, of course, need to wear a petticoat or crinoline under the dress in order to make it flare like it does in the listing photos. I am 5'7" and this hit me just below the knee.
