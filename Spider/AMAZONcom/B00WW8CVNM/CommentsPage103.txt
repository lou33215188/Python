Received the dress...it is beautiful...had ordered a previous one and it fit perfectly....i have ordered this dress twice and both times the dresses came back too small....i don't know if they have different people making them....the red/black/white dress fit perfectly....this one i couldn't even zip up.


this cheap quality, poorly made, don't know if they used a table cloth to make this or what. DON'T BUY!


I love this dress!  My homage to the 50's!!  I pair it with a petticoat underneath and a pair of sexy slingback black patent leather heels.


For cool nights, I add a red shrug sweater.  I have received dozens of compliments for this "throwback" look.


I have purchased two colors from this style on two separate occasions, it is extremely flattering and I love them both! I am 5'6 38-29-42 and they fit PERFECTLY. I get compliments every time I wear them, I want more colors!! I will definitely be buying again


Great dress, but does not stretch. Great quality.


I love this dress, it fits well looks better. Well made & comfortable . I actually bought one with red and one purple.


I'm so in LOVE with my dress! I got it for my tea party bridal shower.  It was a hit! It was a little big, & I did get it taken in just a little but no biggie. It was beautiful & dress was stretchy. Perfect!!! I will be ordering more dresses from this company!!!


Very disappointed with this dress, it was a gift, the dress was covered in brown stains when she tried it on.  Gross! I can only imagine what those stains are.  The merchandise should have been inspected before it was sent out. I want my money back! Not even worth a star rating.


Loved the dress! Great fit, and so many compliments too. Made me feel completely feminine and special. I am a breast cancer survivor so this dress is especially awesome.


LOVE THIS DRESS. It looks amazing on, great shape.  Thicker fabric with a bit of stretch.  I'm ordering every pattern!
