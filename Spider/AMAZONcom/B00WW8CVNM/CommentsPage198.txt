Beautiful dress, but I ordered it too small.. My fault! It's a great dress though!


love it, exactly like the picture I feel so feminine in his dress


This dress is so amazingly beautiful!! The pictures do not do it justice. It is easily my favorite dress. It is extremely well made also.


This dress is gorgeous! Bright vivid colors, with a great fit!


The arm holes were too large so I had to have my sister take them in, but other than that I love it! I usually wear a 16/18 and I ordered the 20 and it fit perfectly.


Fantastic


Super cute!  Exactly as pictured!!  LOVE IT!


Great dress for a great price.


This is a very lovely dress I cant wait to wear it


My daughter loves it. She gets tons of compliments.
