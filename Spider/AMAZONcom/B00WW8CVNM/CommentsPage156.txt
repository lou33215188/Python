Looks great. Order at least one size up than you normally would.


Adorable dress but I wear a size 6 and ordered a large to allow for reviews that it runs small. Still the large was too small. :(


looks gorgeous on my daughter...  fit is perfect, quality is on par... THANKS


Its a nice dress, the print is a little much.. but its a pretty dress. It fits well.


Absolutely beautiful. I read comments before I ordered, I'm a small/medium so I ordered a large and it fits perfectly!


I love it!! I got one size bigger just to be safe. I'm an XL but bought a XXL. It fits perfect. I'm going to wear with a petticoat but would look fine without it. I received it much faster than anticipated. I'm getting ready to buy another in a different color!!


CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS DRESS, YOU CAN WEAR JUST ABOUT ANY COLOR WITH IT. BUT I THINK SILVER LOOKS BEST


Love the dress good quality with the price but runs very small had to return and order bigger


Overall beautiful dress, but not for a large chest. Very sad that I had to return


Beautiful Dress,  perfect fit, I could not have asked for anything prettier for Easter!!
