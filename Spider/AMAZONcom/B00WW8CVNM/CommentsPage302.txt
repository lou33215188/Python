Same with this dress too! I wear 1X ordered 2X to small in the bust.!


Good fabric. Nice design. Comfortable.


It's a little long on me due to my shortness, but it's beautiful!


fit well


Very pretty dress. Gaps a little around the arms but ok if wearing a cardigan as well.


Thread was coming out of seams, poorly made, etc....


Love this dress. Lots of compliments.


The dress is great! Fits snugly through the bust and waist.


I remain perfect, neither too loose nor too fair.


Stretch fabric is what helps make it very comfortable and stylize.


I loved the style I was just little to big for it.
