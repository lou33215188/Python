Cute dress, it arrived quickly, but not what I expected. The color is a little washed out compared to the picture and it was too big due to the stretchiness of the material. Buyer BEWARE my dress had straight pins stuck through the skirt and I didn't  realize until one stuck me.


I usually don't give reviews, but I am forced to.This  is my first time ordering an acevog product and My dress came in today. I am so impressed about this dress,though I was a bit skeptical ordering it, but  it fits perfectly well and it's soo beautiful. I ordered the black floral in medium size  because I wear a US size 6/8 depending on the material. My excitement won't let me wait another minute before I give a review. I can't wait to rock it ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


I adore this dress! I was worried after reading some of the reviews, but I'm so glad I went ahead and bought it! Wore it to church on Easter and it was awesome. Fits perfectly, flattering to any figure (I'm a pear shaped size 4). I will be buying more!


It was cheaply made (what did I expect for the price, right?) and the hem wasn't even, etc. but what made me laugh was when I contacted the seller for a return, they suggested that I first see if someone I know would like to buy it from me! Haha!ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚


Love this dress both with and without a petticoat! I got so many complements at the office. I normally do not wear dresses because of my figure, but this fit perfect in all the right places. I am just over 5 foot and the length was perfect!


I ordered this dress in the same size as the other dresses I ordered from this company, but this one was way too small. I think maybe they had the wrong size on it. Other wise I liked the dress.


Cute dress. it looks like the photo and fits as expected. I would recommend buying it. It zips and there is a tie in the back so you can adjust the snugness of the waist. I am going to a Hawaiian themed office party so this floral dress will work perfect.


Bought this for the Kentucky Derby. Got lots of compliments. Great material, has a little stretch to it. Bought a pettycoat to fluff it up a little.


I got this for my daughter to wear to a wedding. She looks beautiful in it. The dress fits her well, and looks just like the pic. 


The material is very nice, thick enough, not see through and with some stretch. The fitting is a little odd with the waist being extremely high, nearly at the bottom of the bust. Colors are very pretty.


This is shorter than the standard dress so if you wear a crinoline under it's going to show about 4"
