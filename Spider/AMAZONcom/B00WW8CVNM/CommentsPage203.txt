it still look really nice


Great quality at a nice price. Im 5'8", 210 lbs, and got a 2X. Fits great. The ties could be a little longer.


Lovely dress.


The material and color look cheap. Fit is good.


This dress fits beautifully!  I purchased it for an I Love Lucy Halloween costume, but I am so excited to wear it for other occasions!  It is very comfortable and flattering.  I plan to buy another print in this dress.  :-)


Beautiful dress! Neck line is a little wide but I think I'm the only one who notices. Absolutely love it!!!


Didn't like the look in person!


I love it perfect.
