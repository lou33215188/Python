Love this dress. Got  so may compliments on it!!


Fit very well for my size, and is really cute. I bought the dress in the cherry patterns, and have gotten a lot of compliments due to it. When I washed it, though, some threads came loose.


Runs small.  Order two sizes up. Other than that I love this dress! Can't wait to wear it!


Beautiful dress! Fits and looks great! I accessorized it with a jacket and a belt and I received many compliments.


Sizing is crazy. Fit everywhere but in the back. Sad to return it, but you get what you pay forğŸ˜�


Sizing is not correct and product is cheaply made.


Nice look.


I love this dress. I ordered the apricot peach in XXL and found it to be too roomy at the bosom and at the stomach area. However, I am a small breasted woman. I usually wear 38B bras and am a size 14. I am 5'6" tall and weigh 172lbs, with most of the weight at my stomach, butt, and thigh area. I like the pattern and design of the dress very much but the material is not as nice or as thick as I imagined it would be. It is a beautiful dress though and I like it very much. I am very happy with it.


Sizing was way too small. I am pretty much true to size and both dresses were too small.


Very nice dress!
