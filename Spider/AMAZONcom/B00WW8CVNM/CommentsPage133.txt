Just not right - too long & too much material to hem inexpensively - pretty print but will return. Though the two dresses look similar, the quality on the  Black Butterfly line is far superior and worth the extra few dollars.


fine dress...wish i could buy all the colors


I got a small. I'm 5'5' and 127# with a DD bust. It was a little big and fairly long. I hemmed it 5" to sit just below my knee. The dress is gorgeous and feels great.


This dress fits perfect. Exactly the size I ordered. It is made of gold material and easy to iron.


Overall very nice. will buy again but larger. Price great.


This dress is just like the picture and perfect fit.got it for my mom for her vintage theme party. She received so many complaints.


Ran short and looked like an apron, very thin material...


It's a very beautiful dress. I liked is so much, I ordered another one in red. The red one isn't of good quality and looks way inferior. Also the colors smudged a little when I washed the dresses


Fabric is cute but its definitely snug


Way to small and would not take it back. Said I would get some refund but haven't seen any
