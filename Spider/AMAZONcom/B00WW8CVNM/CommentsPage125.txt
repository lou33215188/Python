Terrible material. The shape of this dress is great, but the material is such a low quality that it looks and feels like a costume. Unwearable in regular life.


Loved the style and fabric.However, I didn't like the fact that the pattern and seams didn't match.


Ok ladies I am happy to say that reading the reviews helped me purchase the right size dress fits perfect. I am 5'3 190 and I ordered and XL.


I don't like ordering online clothes...however this dress fit like a glove. I'm five three but kinda busty, however the fabric is stretchy and forgiving. Overall a great fit! The dress fell just past my knees. As other reviewers have said, the fabric does wrinkle, so make sure to iron before wearing!


Seriously...this is so cute. I normally spend $100 on dresses from Modcloth but this is just as high quality and fits as expected.


I ordered this dress up 2 sizes and it still doesn't fit.  And it's way longer then expected.  Return was very easy.


very beautiful.  Somewhat small although I followed the chart.  Slightly uncomfortable if worn for a few hours


This was a beautiful dress! It was well made and looked so nice on! The price was perfect too!


I love it, even though the shoulders are a bit big. it's a good length too, very modest (I'm about 5'7.5"). It hits me at the knee (maybe the center of my knee). I bought one before, it was a large based on the customer reviews I decided to size up but I regret it, this dress is true to size


a great dress but I look like a small child from the farm..a little too short
