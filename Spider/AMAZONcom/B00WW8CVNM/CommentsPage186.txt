The dress is beautiful. They run larger than normal.


Nice dress for the price.  Well made


Fits well, was expecting a softer fabric. the dress was exactly as pictured.


I LOVE LOVE LOVE these dresses. I ordered the red/black and the solid black one along with a black petticoat and a red one. The shipping was very fast, I received the dresses 10 days after I placed the order. I received so many compliments on the red/black one that I ordered the purple/black one today. I'm 5'4, 135 lbs and the medium fit perfectly.

Beautiful Dress!! I have received so many compliments on this dress!! LOVE IT!!


Very pretty dress


The material was good, the design was very pretty, but it was way too long for me. Came down closer to my ankles than knees. I returned it.


I get tons of compliment each time I wear this dress. fits perfectly. I'm a size 6 for tops and size  8 for skirts


If you are a size  M. Order a large. I had to take to the alterations store. It shrank.when I washed it.


Other than that, I enjoy my dress.
