Beautiful fabric and cut, but the zipper broke on the 2nd wearing


its rather tight through the chest area..length is great, color is great, should of gotten a larger size even though its the size I take..


Nicely made dress except the zipper sticks & seems to grab fabric along its sides that impede it's movement.


I normally wear 3X so I ordered 3X and everything was fine except for the chest part, is too tight. Is a very beautiful dress, I received many compliments. I'm thinking on buying another one I just love it


Love it. Absolutely love it. I was really worried it wouldn't fit but it was just my size.


Beautiful Dress and makes me feel beautiful while I'm wearing it. Great spring or work dress.


This dress is so lovely.  I got compliments for days after wearing it.


Wife is 5'7 and 158 lbs and it fits great!


Zipper not sewn in correctly, no finished seams, poorly made overall. Returned it too bad fabric was lovely


i absolutely love it! its perfect! Im a curvy girl and this makes my waist look small and shows my hour glass figure!
