Nice color and fabric. Runs small.  Good price.


love it! Sizes run a little small!


The quality is rough. I thought it would be made of material that's softer. I am unsure if it is my frame, but the front where it covers my chest runs a bit high and flops down a bit so it makes it feel more like a bib. The rest of the body fits fine and isn't too tight or anything.


great nice dress. looks exactly like the pic. fits perfectly.


Love this dress - have already bought another in a different color!


I did not like the dress at all.  Can I return it?


Got a lot of compliments. I liked the feel of the dress. However, i had to alter the top since the chest was too larger for my chest. My sister altered and made it to be more fitted. After the fix, looked a lot better. Dress is made to fit those who have no chest or too much chest so just be aware if you buy you may have to alter the top part of the dress since it's too big. Arm holes will be playing pekaboo with the side breast.


Received a lot of compliments.


Thank you so much!


I liked the length
