Absolutely love this dress, if fits perfectly and feels well made, classic style


Wonderful dress it was so amazing! I LOVE IT


Not a good fit. Quality not good.


i love this dress! i am busty so i altered the neckline lower so it didn't make me look like a uniboober. it looks black and yellow in the picture but it is actually navy, that's my only complaint.


Loved it. Got it for my brother's wedding. Got many compliments. Bought other dresses as a backup. But I didn't need them.


I bought other dresses. Just love them!


Fit was perfect and true to size chart! Love this style and got so many compliments


I purchased this dress for a special event. It fit as expected and looks great when I add a petticoat. I have a pretty large bust and I was worried it would not fit me up top but I was wrong. The fabric is very lightweight. Overall it is a beautiful dress and of good quality.


The material was cheap but I suppose that's what you get for the price.


Love it.


This dress fits about 2 sizes too small, and you can't return it. They do however give you a small portion of your money back.
