It's just a little snug across the chest... And it's a bit longer than I expected, but it's very pretty and still looks nice on.


I love this and love wearing it. I'll wear it church on Sunday morning


overall well designed  especially for the price however it was a little small in the chest for the intended recipient with no room in the fabric to have it let out anywhere.


Pretty dress.  I am size 16 US, but 3x still was to small.


I bought this for my wife and she is an adorable retro girl in this dress.  fits perfect!


Was exactly as pictured. Sizing was right on. Received in timely manner.


The only thing is that I didn't expect the belt.


Didn't realize the dress was using Asian measurements, Had to return :(


I'm not really happy about this dress...the prints are nice but the material...no no...and it's way too big- I ordered medium but for me it looks like extra large..


Sizes run a little big. Got a small, but I'll need to have my mom take it in.
