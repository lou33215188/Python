I'm 6'0, wear a size 14 in pants, and am very large chested. Naturally, buying a dress online is usually a gamble with the odds stacked against me. Even in these times where having curves and being 'plus sized' is embraced, I still struggle to find affordable dresses that fit me well. However, that struggle is temporarily halted here!!!


I ordered this dress in a size XXL and it fits PERFECTLY. Modest enough length to wear to work, about an inch and a half above the knee, and the top doesn't smoosh 'the girls'. It'll also probably still look good if I lose a few LBS because of the tie waist. I got the yellow one and ordered one in the polka dot blue. Love it!


Beautiful. I'm 5'7'' and 120lbs with Bcup breasts so I ordered a small and fits perfectly. It falls to my knees. It came in right on the date it said it would. Looks just like the picture and it's extremely comfortable. I will most defiently be buying more but in different colors and styles because they're so cute.


These  ACEVOG dresses fit me perfectly, like a tailor had measured my body and made me these dresses. This is my 4th dress from this company.  I cut off the tie and put a cinch belt with it. Amazon sells some really cute ones in all colors for under 10.00 that go perfectly with these dresses.  My measurements are around 33 for bust, around 26 for waist. I have small hips but since the dress flairs out it doesn't really make a difference.  The size small is what I get, so if your measurements are the same as mine, this dress will fit perfectly. Since there is a little bit of spandex, that helps, too.  The price is great and the quality is very nice.  They are perfect for the hot Texas summers.


If you are looking for a subtle shaping, I will say this may not be for you - the thickness of the layers poofs your skirt fully and noticeably (exactly what I was looking for!)


I have worn this with both fishnet and nylon stockings and have had no issue with the fabric catching or snagging. Additionally, the material is smooth enough that it does not scratch my thighs.


I work part time at a lingerie store and we just didn't have any petticoats in stock in this size. I initially felt guilty ordering online, but no more


I love the dress and the flattering fit. I experienced none of the quality issues called out by some other reviewers. The seams are well sewn and the zipper the right length.


I purchased the black floral and love the colors. I paired with a red shrug for a finished look. I just ordered a second dress in another color/pattern (dark apricot floral).


I'm 5'5", about 138 pounds and small busted. I purchased a medium. It fits well - snug-fitting above the waist with a flattering flare in just the right place. The length is mid-calf and appropriate for work. the material offers some stretch and is comfortable.


It does have a tie in back, made of matching fabric, which is a little difficult to see in the photos. I could have done without that, as it does get in the way when pairing the dress with a sweater or jacket, but it's definitely not a deal breaker.


I loved it -  but it didn't fit.  Size runs small -  I am 4'10 - 104 pounds -  ordered size small  way too small -  way too long - right on my ankles.  The dress was so pretty I didn't want to send it back -  it was very wrinkled material which could be pressed out but it was totally cotton and had no stretch to it.  Seller got it here on time.  I would have ordered a bigger size but thought the price was a little high for the cotton material.  The dress was also cut too high on the neck for what I like.  It didnt have a V neck like it is pictured.  But the colors were very pretty.  If you order your regular size I would suggest you order a size bigger.


I really like this dress!  I bought it for a tropical vacation and it arrived sooner than promised so I was excited, thinking I was going to get to wear it on vacation. Unfortunately I was sent an XL when I ordered an XXL. The seller declined to issue a refund as the cost of shipping back to China was too high for a $19 dress. I agreed and the seller gave me 20% of my money back. I do have Prime and notice that it is now listed as having free returns, it must not have been the case when I had ordered. I ended up ordering another of this same style and color in XXL and then one in purple in a size XXXL because I liked the dress so much I was set on having it for my vacation.


On to the dress..... like others have mentioned, it is a thin material with a slight stretch to it. My husband commented he really liked the fabric. The sizing chart is accurate if you measure yourself correctly. Do not go by US clothing sizes. Use a tape measure. I am 5'4'' 170 lbs and wear a 12. I am  very muscular with a long waist and a 38 B. So most clothing problems come from my shoulders being too wide/arms being to big and shirts not being long enough. The XXL and the XXXL fit me fine where the XL would not even come close to zipping up past my shoulder blades. My ribs were too big. :)  I could not have fixed it by wearing Spanks.  The waist hits too high on me, but using a wide belt ( sitting slightly below the dress waist ) helps. I think that is why the XXXL fit also, it hangs a little bit lower and I can cinch it in since it is below my chest cavity. If anyone is between sizes and has a low waist, I would go up a size. Otherwise just go by the chart provided by ACEVOG.


I know it sounds like I should look really hideous in this dress, but it really is flattering and I am extremely happy with it.


Love love love this dressğŸŒ¹ğŸŒ· I wear a large but ordered xl fit was perfect, I did have it hemed to my knees, it was a little long for my taste Highly recommend purchase ğŸ‘�


Ok. This is the second dress, same print. Nice print.  I like ACEVOG dresses, they have good prints and colors.  However, they really need to work on quality control.  The quality of the dresses I've received aren't consistent.  The thread tension is off, the hem is jagged (it's low in the front and back and short on the sides), and the zipper isn't  all that hidden.  The bodice and the skirt aren't sewn evenly. I'm so frustrated with ACEVOG!  Consistent quality please.  I am not sure if I'm keeping the dress, but I like the print. This dress was 3/4" longer than the first, however, it still has the same issues with the zipper and uneven seam.


I am 5'7 and 200lbs. I ordered a 4xl and after 1st not reading the sizing and ordering WRONG i got it right the second time around. I will enjoy wearing this to my jehovah witness convention later this month...update with pictures of 4xl size.
