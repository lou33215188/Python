Really liked it! Looks like polished cotton. Just a little too small so I returned it.


Very nice


Beautiful dress with a good lengthHowever not made for busy women. It fit my waist perfectly but was about to 4 inches too small in the bust.


For reference I am 5'5", typically size 18 and a 44G bust.


i got this for my daughter in college will e taking it to her soon hope it fits


Great :) I used it for a school play. I was Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray and it was perfect ! Exactly what I was looking for. I am 5'6 and I ordered a small and it fit perfect, I also used a petticoat.


perfect


Way too long


Gorgeous dress!! I am 5'2" & 1/2 (gotta add the half) weigh 117lbs and purchased this in small. Fits very well. Comes just below my knees. Maybe a little too long but I like it. Will be buying more. Now on to find shoes!!


This dress is pretty than imagined.


I really like this style of dress.  It fits very good and looks great!
