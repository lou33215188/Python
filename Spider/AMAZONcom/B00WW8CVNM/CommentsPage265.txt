This dress is amazing. Fits great. I got an 3xl and it reached a little below my knee. So I just adjusted it by cutting it to make it a bit shorter, but awesome dress


It was a nice Kentucky Derby dress!!


Thanks


This dress runs small, so go a size up.


I love it!!!! The fabric is a little thinner than I expected but it it fits great. The length is perfect. I want to get some more in different patterns.


Love the colors. Extremely comfortable dress and nice material.
