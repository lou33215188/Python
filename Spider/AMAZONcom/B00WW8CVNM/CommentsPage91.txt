Love this dress. Wearing it to a wedding next week. Compliments my body type.


I am tall (5' 11"), so it fits a little short for me on the torso, but the dress is very well made and quality material.


I LOVE this dress! Its so cute and sassy. Comfortable and I gave gotten so many compliments! Ive bought it in a few more different prints. Im a size 10 and the large fits perfectly.


I wish I could give more stars. I followed the size chart and recieved an awesomely made, sturdy and economically priced outfit. The quality was higher than expected and it shipped quickly.


This is the first item of clothing that I bought off this site that completely100% met every expectation! I'd gotten so many compliments on this dress! Love it and would definitely buy more from this seller!


Very pleased with this dress!


Flattering, I bought the Scarlett petit coat to go with it. Can't wait to wear it.  I'm about 195#s and 5'4" comes to above mid calf. I purchased a size xl, but I'm sort of pear shaped.


Love it! I'm a bit broad shouldered, so it's a bit tight across the chest (I can't zip it up on my own because of the style), but it's absolutely adorable and well worth the price. I'm a 42D and I got the 3X. Other necklines would probably fit more comfortably, but I'm not used to such a high neckline so it's all a bit new to me.


Such a cute dress, but it didn't come close to zipping up.  WAY too small in the bust. I would have loved to wear this out.  I'm so bummed, but it's going back.  I can't order it bigger because everything else fit.


The dress was a little too big, but after I washed it fits GREAT !!!!! Going to order more.
