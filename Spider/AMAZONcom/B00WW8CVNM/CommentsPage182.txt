So flipping cute!!!  I feel really girly, love it.


It is snug in the bust as advertised but there is some stretch to the material.  Dress is made of a light material.  It has a few string that will need to be cut, but nothing extreme.  This dress make me feel ultra feminine and pretty without being to revealing.  Love it!


It was a perfect fit. I never find good fits online but this was a huge steal. Amazing. I love it.


Beautiful dress. It's very flattering and hides the flaws. This dress will be perfect for a May wedding.


Verry beautifull for here


Returned item as it did not fit properly and have not received refund yet


these are my favorite new dresses. flattering! comfortable!


I read other reviews before purchasing and heeded the "too small" warning.  I bought the next size up and it is a perfect fit!  Paired it with a fluffy underskirt and it is exactly what I was looking for.  Can not beat the price!


just right on bottem but to small on top thanks


Needs a little give but it still is the cutest!
