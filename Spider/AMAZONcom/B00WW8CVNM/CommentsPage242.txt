It was such a beautiful and comfortable dress. I had to return it because it was too causal for the occasion and they made it so easy.


Love the way this fits, I'm 5'7, 150lbs and I got the size 6. Fit couldn't be better.

I should have paid more attention to the material. It reminds me of scrubs, but I love the style.

I have bought MANY cool retro dresses but this is by FAR the cutest, best fit and most flattering. I feel like a pretty, playful, happy girl ! I love this dress.


I just got this today and have fallen in love with it!  I ordered an XL and the fit is perfect.  Material is thick and has a nice stretch to it.  Looking forward to warmer weather so I can wear it out!


I love this dress! I get complements left and right every time I wear it .
