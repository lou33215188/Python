As other reviewers suggested, you might need to size up by one size.  Exactly what I was looking for as I have 4 summer weddings to attend,  I purchased a petticoat slip and like the way this dress looks with and without the petticoat.


My wife loved it and it did look great on her.  I bought a similar dress before and it was too tight around the bust, so if a big bust is an issue, be sure to get the next larger size because it really fit nicely.


Its a little stetchy. But its still tight in armpit area. I ordered one size up to try and make sure the chest would have room but its very uncomfortable to move. And the zipper gets caught half way up without a second person getting in and out is next to impossible.


Pretty dress, but WAY too small, even when I ordered 2 sizes up. I ended up giving to my friend who is half my size and it fit her perfectly.


This dress is very cute and the material seems to be comfortable with a bit of a stretch to it. I made a mistake and ordered it a size too big so I need to reorder it in a smaller size, but overall it is a great buy


Cute dress but the zipper didn't work right away. Never even got to wear it. Please make it right and send another one. :(


This dress is a wonderful, quality piece, BUT, beware if you have a larger chest.


Mine was WAY too tight on my chestğŸ˜¢


Beautiful fit, nice length, and the fabric had enough stretch to it that it was very comfortable for all day wear.


I went a size bigger after reading the reviews for this dress. It fits perfectly every where except for the chest. It is way too tight in that area. It is a very pretty dress and well made though.


Beautiful dress.  Make sure you buy the dress on the bust size.  Truly a good dress and a good price.
