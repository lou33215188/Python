I can't believe how nice this dress is. I was looking for a dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner, but didn't want to spend a lot. The material is nice and thick, and it is well made. I'm a size US 18-20 and the 3x fits great.


Amazing dress if you are 120lbs with a perfect figure and 5'7..lol those are the measurements of my daughter for the small size dress.. It looks bangin on her! Amazing.. But if I tried it on, 5'2 140..sorry no matter the size(oompa loompa) its a beautify dress, material is a bit thin, need the tutu under to style it up! Remember, when you have a conservative dress the shoes can be  tj hooker ğŸ˜‰


Beautiful dress  felt like I was in the 50's make sure you get xxl if you are a 14


My daughter picked this dress out for her 8th grade graduation. I ordered up 2 sizes because of there reviews saying it was small and it fit perfectly! I will definitely be ordering more in other colors!


It's a beautiful dress. I gave it as a gift to a friend and she loves it.


I love this dress. The price was right, it was available for prime, darling dress.


Wore it to my moms birthday party. I received a lot of compliments. I intend to buy other colors.


I was skeptical with it being as inexpensive as it is that it would fall apart the first time I washed it.  It's definitely not a top-quality dress, but it's better than I expected for the cost.  The bust is a little snug, otherwise it fits well.  I purchased a large after reading some reviews and have a 39" bust.


Looks great on and fits perfect. I removed the tie back as I think it looks better.


I love this dress.  It is very feminine and fits great.


Please follow the sizing guide. And you will not a problem with the dress. If you are between sizes order up a size. Beautiful dress for the price. Lot's of compliments.
