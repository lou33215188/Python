Fit well. A little on the long side, but I'm short. I got a ton of compliments and would buy again.


love it! exactly what I was look for.


Only guys as expected because I ordered 2 sizes bigger after reading the reviews. This does not run true to size


Love the colours will keep be a useful I am determined ed to fit in it


My wife is tiny and went with a small, she loves it!


Love it ğŸ˜Š


Fits like a dream! I love this dress. Arrived quickly


Unfortunately this arrived broken and completely unwearable, as the zipper was wedged halfway up the dress and couldn't budge in either direction. The waist was also poorly sewn but would have been manageable without the zipper issue. That said, this dress was very pretty and certainly a good price, and I hope my experience was a fluke for others. And shout out to the Amazon refund team for working efficiently.


Note: I chose 'fit as expected' based entirely on the measurements listed, as it should have fit with a proper zipper. I was not able to put it on.


LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this dress!!!


Very loose stishes and not all stish.you can see the thread  on some parts. Stishes not very strong.  Is like if it was made in a hurry.
