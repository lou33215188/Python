A little snug and a little long...excellent material though and beautiful!!!!!!

I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding this summer. The fabric is stiffer than I thought it would be. And the back at the top gapes a little.  Overall it fits well but I'm going to have to iron it as it came very wrinkled. Not quite what I expected but OK for the price

It is a very thin fabric and I guess if it fit it would be cute.  It ties in the back and has a very high neck.  The hem is mid calf.  Colors are nice but I get the feeling after one wash this would not look as good.


Lovely vibrant fabric, sturdy construction, and a great style and fit. I couldn't be happier with this product! Seriously considering buying the same dress in other colors because I like it so much.


Color is nice. Bodice fits just right, but too long for me. I am 4"11. Needs to find out how to shorten the lenght to make it just right


I ordered an XL and it was a size too big. The material is stretchy and forgiving. I am 5'8 and 155lbs and wear a 34F. I ordered the black and red in a size large and it was snug on the bust but looks great.


Have to lose about 10 pounds to have it fit. Which I am trying to do anyway, but this is way undersized


Fit perfect very full skirt looks great with peticoat


my friend is a 0 size we order the smaller size they have wich mean small. a little bit large for her but she loves it.like the material.
