Really great dress! Very comfy!


Let me see if I can be nice.  Florida flag is awful!  One sided.  Fuzzy gator image.  Nothing like in the picture.  Cheap.  Cheap.  Cheap.  What should I expect, it is made in China.  DO NOT BUY.


This dress is not big boob friendly. The material gave me a rash, the fabric is really cheaply made and kinda see through.


Smaller than expected. Same size I ordered in same company but that fit more appropriate and bigger than this dress in same size.


Cute on the outside but cheaply made. I would not be seen wearing this. Bummer was hoping it would be nicer. Far from classy.


Poorly hemmed, crooked


Super pretty, and fits as expected. Also a great price for the dress.


Please be aware customers before wasting your money.


Yeah, I'm going to buy about half a dozen more, lol. It is a lovely dress. :)


To small and the print looked faded. The fullness of the skirt was not at all like the picture.
