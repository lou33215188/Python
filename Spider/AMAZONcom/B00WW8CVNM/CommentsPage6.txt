I bought this in green for St.Patrick's day and it's a lovely shade. The fabric is nice quality with a little stretchiness. I'm 5'7, 123lbs, 36DD, 27" waist, 34" hips. I ordered a Medium based on the size chart. It fits a little loose on top and in the waist, which was unexpected. It hangs just at my knees, and looks good with or without a petticoat.  I'm going to take a chance and dry it in the dryer, hoping it will shrink a bit. I actually think I could've gone with a small due to the stretchy nature of the fabric and cut of the dress - I could slip it over my head without unzipping, however due to my poor planning I didn't have time to exchange it before St. Patrick's Day. Depending on how it launders I may order more in other colors because it is a nice, comfortable, flattering dress for the price.


Update:  dried this dress in a hot, laundromat dryer with other similar color clothing and it did shrink enough to fit me well, but it also shortened it considerably. It was hoping I wouldn't need to iron it after being tumble dried, but I still did. I wore it with petticoats and it was a big hit on St. Patrick's Day. I got many compliments from both men and women.


I received this dress in a timely manner and  my eyes widen as I unwrapped this beautiful dress!  The material is cotton like and and very well made as it has a tight weave with a little stretch for  a form fitting upper fit. The pattern was so pretty and true to the picture. But alas this dress is designed for a smaller busted woman.  There is no way my 42DD's were going to fit this.  I am so disappointed!  I have to return this dress or buy another one for the material to take to a tailor.  I don't think even a 5xl would do the job. I ordered a 4xl and I normally wear a 18W.  I am so disappointed.  It is a beautiful dress. Thank you Amazon for the free shipping return.  ACEVOG!  We need to talk.


Quick disclaimer, I did receive this product for free in return for a review. And I wish there were half stars, because this should be a 4.5.


I received the white dress with black and red flowered patterns in a size 4x. I went with the 4x after looking at the sizing chart and a quick self-measurement. My bust alone was 10" more than the sizing chart specified would fit, so I wasn't really expecting to be able to wear it straight out of the package. I normally wear a US size 2x, or maybe just an XL if the fabric is stretchy, and I was aaaaalmost able to pull the zipper up on this one. I think If I had help to do so, it would have closed (rather tightly, mind you, but it could have gotten there)! So that was a pleasant surprise. And although I'm saying I could squeeze more than expected into it, don't purchase the sizes with that in mind. It is NOT an elastic fabric at all.


If I recall correctly, the item ships from china, but arrived within about two weeks, which is not bad at all coming from china. It came in a resealable thick plastic and mesh pouch, which was nice, and will definitely protect your garments during transit better than what most US companies send their clothing in.


The fabric is slightly on the thicker side, and curiously enough, doubles over on the top half or so of the bust around the collar. This pushes the fabric a bit away from your bra, so even if you're wearing a dark color underneath, it's not super obvious. If you look very hard in good lighting and the dress is tight up against you, you might see a faint darkening, but again, it's not at all obvious.


The design is not exactly what I was expecting from the photos. I've got one of THE worst muffin tops, and I was dreading how this dress would look on them, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it begins to flare out above the rolls, and by looking, you can't even tell they're there! A very flattering cut for those of us who have issues with that. I do have to say though that I am a bit disappointed in the length of the dress. I am 5' 5" and the dress is rather long on me, reaching mid-slightly lower calf. I was expecting about knee length. It could always be hemmed, but I'd personally prefer not to deal with the added hassle of doing so.


The quality looks pretty decent as well, with the exception of a few things. I found a few bundles of threads sewn into the dress that stick out... one  on the back of the dress directly under the zipper. I think I can cut them all off, but the one on the back might still stick out a bit. Thankfully, the zipper is not at all visible from the outside of the dress, and tucks into the fabric nicely when zipped up -- I hate seeing the zipper on the back of a beautiful dress! I did not like how long the zipper was inside the dress though, it looked about 2" longer than it needed to be.


Over all, it's a great dress, and especially at the price it's listed for! The dress I was given did have a few flaws on it, and I wasn't expecting the length based on the images of other styles, but I didn't measure for length either so that's on me. Make sure you check the sizing chart in the listing and image (NOT the amazon sizing charts) and measure yourself to find the correct size, as these ARE Asian sizes.


PERFECT purple floral Easter Sunday church dress!!!! I felt beautiful in it, and received so many compliments on it.


Advice- Measure yourself and purchase the size based on your inches! To help, my measurements and the size I bought are as follows:


I'm 5'5" and a half (the half matters, lol!), with broad shoulders (swimmers body). I'm a 38I bra size (I as in "i"ğŸ™„- buying bras is the bane of my existence), with a 37" under bust and 52" full bust.


36 inch waistline (not lost the baby weight, from 2014ğŸ˜†), but I can get it to 35 with a corset, once I got it to 34! Lol.


SO, I ordered the 4XL, praying it would zip over my breasts.


IT ZIPPED PERFECTLY!!! It had just barely enough stretch to it. I wore my basic t-shirt bra (no push-up or molding), and it was so flattering. It's very classy and feminine, I felt like Lucille Ball!


At church I had a white crochet shrug over my shoulders, which I removed for brunch. I paired it all with 3-inch white wedges, and wore some pearls- all I needed was a derby hat, ha!


I bought this petticoat to go with it, and it was perfect: Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt Petticoat Black(XL) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011RJ06Z6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awd_ElH-wbCE2KS8Y


This dress is a lovely sundress - the fabric is bright, light cotton. I found the medium was a little big in the bust and sides, and I am 5'4", 135 pounds, 34/32/48. I always get a lot of compliments in this dress; the print is unique and very spring-y. :) The only con is that since the fabric is cotton, like quilting cotton,and wrinkles really easily. So, this isn't a fancy dress by any means, but is a great summer daytime outing dress. It will get wrinkly on the back whenever you sit.


Purchased this dress for a wedding. Sipping was fast and it was packaged ok. It's a dress so it doesn't need fancy packaging. I had a hard time deciding which size to order. I am a size 17. I took my measurements and according to the chart I should have ordered a 4xl!! Instead I went with my gut and ordered the 2xl and I'm happy I did! I am curvy and this dress hugged them perfectly. The dress was much longer than I had thought it was but that was ok since it was for a wedding. The dress is well made for its price and was comfortable to wear all day and night long. Very breathable. The colors were beautiful!! I would definitely reccomend this dress to anyone who is looking into buying one. Very pretty and form fittin in all the right places while not being too revealing. The high neck line covered my large chest without squishing and smothering them :) and the longer length kept me feeling comfortable while dancing all night. No worries about giving anyone a peep show. You won't be disappointed!


Love this dress and true to size


I got the red flower dress in the 3X Plus - I'm 6'0" tall and usually wear a woman's size 16 but based on everyone's reviews, the size chart in the dress description, and a Q&A question that said the 3X Plus was longer, I sized up and am glad I did. Like others with large chests, the dress fits me a little snug through the bust but fits perfectly through the waist and - most surprisingly - is long enough to cover my knees. There's an odd bit of gapping right by the underarm, so I may have my tailor try to fix that and loosen the bust. For a $22 dress, it was worth it and I'll consider getting other colors if my tailor can fix this one. Overall a beautiful dress that looks exactly like the picture, with a nice heavier weight cotton blend material.


I'm 5'6, 36C, 135-140 (classic hourglass shape), and the large fits like a glove.  LOVE it.  Couple coworkers bought me the medium for my birthday, and I returned it with no problems for a large.


I've got color Floral-24 (black with large blue roses).  The fabric is very thick with a slight stretch to it.  There's no tag, so I don't know what it's made of, but I'd assume a high percentage of cotton with a small percentage of spandex.  There's no translucency at all, or bleed-through of the print.  The finishing is good; all seams are serged (only one serge with a weird loop, but I snipped it off no problem), few loose threads, and nothing off-center.  The back ties are attached (not a separate belt), meaning that you can shrink the waist a bit without having it tailored.  This is also the first of these dresses I've bought recently that has a nice back zip.  The other dresses I've bought have had side zips, of which I'm not a fan even when they come all the way to the armscye.  A back zip makes it nice and easy to get in and out :)


It's cut a bit high in the armscye, but I think that's a matter of my being oddly-shaped and not the dress being oddly-cut.


A word on sizing: if you haven't bought one of these from any other sellers, buy at least one size up from your regular size.  This particular dress (as of Jul 2016) doesn't have a sizing chart, which most of them do.  The dresses are made in China and for smaller people than your standard American.  Check the chart on other similar dress pages if you're not sure, but do NOT go by the standard Amazon sizing chart as it doesn't apply.  Or just buy a couple sizes and return the ones that don't fit.


UPDATE: This dress has shrunk a smidge since I washed it.  I washed it on cold (in the washing machine), and line-dried it (vertically, not horizontally).  The fabric is stretchy enough that the top is still ok, but I definitely see a difference in the skirt length.  Fingers crossed that this is all the shrinking it does.


I am 5'3" 42" bust, weigh in at 206 and bought a 3xplus  HOLY CRAP am I impressed. The material will definitely hold up to repeated wear.  I purchased the dress in red to wear to the office and it looks nice. it hits me just below mid calf but that is to be expected since I'm a shorty.


Let me say plus size ladies, it is so flipping nice to find clothes that don't look like flipping sacks.  Just because I'm rounder than Angelina Jolie doesn't mean I don't have a waist and curves.  I am forever searching for clothes that don't look like I'm just wearing a big garbage bag.


I will likely get this dress hemed up a little (its a little long on me but nothing a nice pair of pumps cant fix) and will likely get a couple darts put into the chest area.  But that is actually normal.  I would LOVE to be able to find far more base pieces like this that I can afford to tailor to my funky body and then have it look nice.


I am so excited I want to cry a bit.
