To small...the size chart is incorrect


Arrived fast and fit fine. I machine washed mine and it did not affect the color nor the size.


Beautiful dress, quality is great, it does run a bit large.


Super smaller than listed size. Soooo wrong


Love the dress but it's nearly impossible to get the wrinkles out.


Size XL did not work. Too small in the waist. Could not zip. I need to return item for a bigger size. What do I need to do?


The waist line is a little too high, but it's a beautiful dress


Very nice dress.  A little too snug in the bust area.  I am a larger busted woman.


I love the dress! The only problem is the zipper is cheap and gets stuck easily. It will need to be replaced. But it looks great and fits fabulously!


I wear an 8  but ordered a large and fit perfect.
