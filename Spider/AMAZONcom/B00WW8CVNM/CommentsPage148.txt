Lovely dress it's comfortable, fits as expected and looks just like the photo. Nothing to complain about it.


A nice dress but not cut in a flattering way for bigger sizes. Too short-waisted. Probably styled in Asia??? Really pretty fabric and nice construction.


This is the second dress I ordered, I'm a size 9-10 this dress fit perfectly and the color looks accurate


What a sweet dress.  Love it.... fits great bought a petticoat to flare it out. Wearing for a may wedding. Bought 4 dresses for the event and everyone picked this one. Love the length material and fit.


Unfortunately had to return the dress due to the garment measurements not being accurately advertised. Wish it had fit, it was a very pretty, figure flattering dress.


Charming number, esp with a petticoat and a hat/gloves. I feel it runs small, esp if you are bigger in the chest area  I recommend ordering a bigger size than you would normally wear


This dress was super cute, but not for me. The neckline was close to choking me and the upper section was confining in the back but loose in the front. I think it would have better fit someone more well-endowed than I. I'm about 5'4'', 150 lb, and I ordered a small.


I am 5'5 and 160 pounds; item was a little tight in the breast (DD) but looks very nice once zipped up.  I also purchased 50s vintage Petticoat,26" Length Net Underskirt to go underneath it and it looks outstanding.  The waist is very flattering; the rolls don't show!  Product is well made.  I am happy with the purchase.


it looks pretty here, but the measurements were strange.  Arm holes were large and pulled.  The dress wasn't sewn in two places on the sides were the skirt part is. worn once with a sweater. Too bad, the design is pretty


Beautiful dress. In the photo I'm wearing a petticoat underneath to give it that fullness.
