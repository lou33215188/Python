like the colors and the design but the length is weird. It should either be longer or shorter..I think it should be longer


my daughter loves this dress!  It is very cute, the print is so pretty!  shipping was VERY quick too.  thank you!


Super cute fits perfect but i did order a size up


This dress was very small i ordered a size larger and  it still was too small.


Very disappointed fit was way to small cost a small fortune to send it back to another country.


If you order a dress that is $20, don't cross your fingers and hope it looks like a million bucks! I just don't seem to learn. The dress did not feel/look like anything on the computer. It is truly a 50's dress---dawdy and drab:( but it is too much work to send it back. So I am keeping it as a reminder to think twice next time. If it is took good to be true, it probably is just that: too good to be true.


I do like the dress but you need a slip to wear it.  Lays flat not as picture is.


Ok


I love this dress, it's very beautiful and fits nicely. The top was a tad big but a simple tac in the front gave it a stylish adjustment and a more fitted feel.
