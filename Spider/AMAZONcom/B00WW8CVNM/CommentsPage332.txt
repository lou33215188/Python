Very cute and fun dress


Received product early. It was somewhat damp out of package, but hung it up and dried nicely and chemical smell disappeared. I previously bought this dress in a different pattern, fulfilled by Amazon. This one however came from China. It fits somewhat smaller than the purple one. It is not a true ACEVOG as it is labeled something different. Also, the zipper broke after the first zip up. Fortunately I can get the zipper replaced for minimal cost. Make sure you order a true ACEVOG and you won't be disappointed.

Downgrading my rating.  I ordered this dress in a 3xl Plus (red/black) and it was too tight in the bust.  I then went back and ordered the 4XL Plus in Blue and it is smaller in the bust area than the 3XL Plus.  It is really disappointing since the blue/black color is so vibrant and beautiful.  Returning both.  This merchant and Amazon should consider not selling the plus sizes if they are really just an XL with with a different label.
