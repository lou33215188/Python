I love the style of the dress, but it is way too small.  That is the reason for the low score.


Overall it is a nice dress. But the sides seems shorter than the front and back.


It's perfect


I really like it.


The dress fits dreamt.


the bodice fits as expected. but the length is longer than expected.


Came quickly, fit perfectly!


Very pretty. Fit but a little snug on top. Super cute and lots of compliments.


A little tight on the bust line but I still love the dress!


Was too small.. The fabric was stiff and the garmet was not well made.
