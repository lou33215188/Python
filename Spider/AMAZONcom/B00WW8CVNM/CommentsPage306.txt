Love it


This is a beautiful dress.  I love the way it fits.  It's very flattering.


It's a lovely dress. I recommend ordering a size up, as the dress doesn't stretch.


So cute!! Definitely worth every penny. I would recommend a size larger than normal.. I did and it fits like a dream!


Nice material and workmanship.


Very nice


It fits ok but Im 5ft 2 and it came to my mid calf area so it needs to be hemmed up some way to long for my taste


lovely


I have not worn it yet but tried it and it fit perfectly.  Would recommend to buy


Love it
