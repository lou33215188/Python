Very cute, love the fit!


Love it


I wish it were a couple inches longer.


Love this dress, Im a little short, so I will need to get it hemmed up but it does perfectly otherwise, I could not be happier!


Love it! Thank you


Very pretty but definitely Asian sizes so runs VERY small. Bought this in a 3X, which is one size bigger than what I wear thinking it would fit but it is WAY too small through the arms, shoulders, and bust so it is useless for me. Total waste of money and to pay for a return isn't worth spending more money to ship it back overseas.


Size chart was on par!


I love, love, love this dress! Thank you Acevog.


It fits extremelly small.


Great quality, couldn't believe the price...definitely worth it!
