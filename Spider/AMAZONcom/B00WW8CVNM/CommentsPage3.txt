Love this dress. Nice material. Affordable but a good value. I wore my dress at Dapper Day at a theme park. All day comfort and got so many compliments.


I'm pretty overwhelmed with the quality, fit, color and overall style of this dress, and might I add slightly annoyed that I've been paying twice as much for the same dresses at other places. This dress is stretchy and fits perfectly on my 5'7 160-165 frame in a large. The length is perfect as well. Will definitely shop here again. A+++++++


I love this dress! It is a bit a snug in the arm pit area as other reviews stated though. I received so many compliments when I wore this dress to a wedding. I gave it three stars because the zipper was very cheap and honestly almost impossible to zip up because of this. I was really afraid it was going to break.


I have finally found a dress that fits my short,  yet round figure, that fits just right and looks amazing!!! I am so so so SO I'm love with this dress,  i will Definetely be buying more. The top part is modest and covers my chest - which seems rare now adays - and the length stops just  half way on my calf which is perfect.  I can wear this dress to work (at a state government building) and it looks professional with a light cardigan.  The material is comfortable and not see through. I am very impressed.  I have a 54 inch waist and this dress is nicely flattering in a modest and comfortable way.  This is the first dress i have worn in over ten years (I'm not much of a dress person) and i can finally wear one with confidence.  Thank you!!!!!


Beautiful dress! I really like the color and the material. shipping took about 10 days, which was fine. it is a tiny bit big on me, I ordered the medium size (I am 5'7", 130 lbs).  I got so many compliments. Absolutely would recommend getting it for a romantic classy look!


I am 5'10" and wear a size 14 dress. I have a 36DD bust.  The XXL fit well, maybe a tiny bit short, but I'm used to that.  Skirt is not as full as it looks in the pictures, and the seam tail is sticking out of the back, so I will have to fix that, but otherwise good, I will likely wear it a lot.


I wear a size 16 or 18, depending on the brand, and I got the 3XL of this dress. A delicate and fragile flower I ain't. But this dress makes me look like I am. There's enough room for the girls, although I do end up with a bit of gapping at the arm holes, so it looks best with a bolero jacket (this is what I'm wearing in the pic: 


). I like the 


 for contrast, but the dress doesn't actually need it, as there's a waist tie to define that area. The skirt goes a few inches past my knees, and I am relatively tall at 5' 8", so that's unusual. And nice. The fabric is thick enough to show my underoos, but light enough to comfortable in the Houston heat.


The only thing that would make this dress utterly perfect was if it had pockets. My kingdom for dresses with with pockets.


This dress IS very cute! Not going to deny that! Nor am I sending it back! It looks nice on me, I am approx. 5'2", 174 lbs. I had to get the 3x based on the chart and other customer comments (thank you by the wayğŸ˜†) . That was the depressing part. I have included some photos to show the kinds of loose threads you might find, but it is an easy thing to cut off. Also, yes, their zipper sewing usually doesn't seem to extend down the full length of the zipper, but again not a big deal, at least not to me. The zipper is a nylon zipper so if buying this dress I suggest not getting it too tight, as it could "bust open". My dress, surprisingly has extra room in the chest area. I am a 38D to a 40C depending on the cut, but this top part is loose. Sorta nice so I don't have to smoosh the "twins". Skirt part flares just enough w/out a petticoat, add one for extra poof! Comes out of the package a little wrinkled,  not too bad. Touch up iron or lightly steam. Fabric is comfortable and about medium weight. Not too heavy but not real, real thin. Going to wear to church soon and it's Summer, so we'll see if I remain comfortable. Just wearing a very, light, black, crocheted, short, open sweater to cover top of arms (haven't got much color this Summer). Love this cherry pattern, glad to find a dress like this! Price was fair too!


Perfect fit, I ordered by the company's sizing chart that was in the Product description. Easy to order and was Prime when I ordered it so was here right away. Love the dress. Comes in a small bag so definitely needs steamed but the material will make it an easy fix. Had absolutely no problems with the fit and it zipped right up. Length was great falling before


 the knee is modest and super flattering on my larger figure :) Hides everything below the natural waist like a charm. Looks amazing with a nice wide belt added to it and I am normally anti-belt as they have a tendency to enhance fat I just don't want pointed at. Overall Love this dress, the material, and the cut. Would definitely buy again. In fact it is a bridesmaid dress and the other two bridesmaids are going to get this one now as well.


I'd give this 4.5 stars if that was possible.


I bought the purple floral dress, and I love it! I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely buy more of these dresses in different fabrics.


Speaking of fabric, it seems to be a cotton/poly blend but doesn't feel overly synthetic. It has a nice weight to it and a some stretch. I'd say it runs a bit small. I'm 36/30/38, a solid size 8 (U.S.) and the large fits me almost perfectly. There is some gaping at the neck. I'm not sure if buying a medium would fix that issue or make me look like I'm stuffed into the dress at the waist. That's the only reason I'd knock off half a star.


I believe it's fitted this way so that it can fit a range of bust sizes.


I am very very happy with this dress! I'm wearing it with a petticoat underneath. Perfect for the wedding in a conservatory of flowers I'm going to next month.
