My wife loves this dress, she is planning on buying more.


Dress is beautiful i wear a size 16 ordered a 3x and it was tight but it's is a beautiful made dress with good material


loves it !!! definitely ordering more


Beautiful dress! I received plenty of compliments.


I love the material of this dress, it fits perfect beautiful pattern just like the 50's


I'm so disappointed. I followed the measurement instructions, and ordered a size larger than I usually do. The dress just does not fit. I guess I'll be looking up instructions on how to return.


I think the dress is beautiful.  It is a little bit large for me, but I think that I ordered well.  The next size smaller would have been too small.  It is very comfortable and pretty.


Arm holes are too small and it gets tight but its a nice dress


The zipper came already ripped :( too bad, because the dress is very pretty, just horribly put together.


Love this dress, very cute, only problem was the sticking on one side is easy off...however it is all black so you can't tell
