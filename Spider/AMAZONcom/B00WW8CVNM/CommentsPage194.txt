I like the dress it self just to long for me I'm 5'3 its goes to low culf I expected just on my knee but others than that dress pretty cute in have stretch on it


Dress fit oddly, but the company handled the issue well.


I absolutely love this dress. The fabric has some give to it which makes it comfortable and forgiving. I ordered a large, I am a 38D and the fit was perfect in the chest.


Love this dress!!! I bought the purple flower version. To all the people complaining about the fit: these are NOT American or UK sizes! Use the chart and take your measurements and it will be perfect. Love the material, the length, an the bias cut for stretch. I went back and ordered a different color, in fact.


This is a fabulous dress.  The fabric is just stretchy enough to give you a perfect fit without being too tight.  I've worn it twice and almost everyone who sees me compliments the dress.  The shape and the length are very flattering, even if you are mature or a little overweight.


The dress for perfectly and is not heavy. It's a great summer dress for a special occasion.


Gorgeous


I absolutely adore this dress! There's a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric which allows for a lovely fit. I have a 40" bust and the Large fits perfectly. Can't wait to wear it on my beach vacation!


love this dress looks wonderful
