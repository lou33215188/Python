This dress looks great! I did order it with a petticoat because in my opinion it definitely needs ome to dress it up. (I wore this dress to a wedding) The only reason I am giving this dress 4 starts and not 5 is because I went with the measurements in the description and according to that I needed an XL. So that's what ai ordered and I definitely could have worn a L. I am almost 5'3 and about 165lbs. So I would order the size you normally wear, and it does have a little strech to the material. Ordered the gradient purple.


I love this dress, I plan on adding more styles of it to my closet!  I'm 6'1 190lbs and got it XL and like the way it fits. I just love the way this dress looks!


Love the dress for the price


Love love this dress.  Complements the entire time I had this dress on..I will be purchasing this in another color. The dress is so slimming.  You can dress the dress down or up.


I bought the white dress with red and black flowers. It fits me perfectly and looks really pretty. I had to change the zipper because it broke after two times. Other than that, a great dress for a great price.


I bought this as a gift and it was a HIT! Awesome!


Dress is lovely, material is great, for a summer dress this one is awesome. Comfortable. Would recommend this as a great buy!


Fits ok, a little longer than what I was expecting not sure if I will keep it or return and exchange for something else. I am 5'5" 165lbs (normally a size 10). The length was well past my knees, where it hit was a little off for what I am looking for (probably my fault did not pay enough attention to the length)...everywhere else on the dress the fit was ok (ordered a large)


Ordered a size larger then normal and it was still too small and had to be returned.


Finally got this dress the material is very nice and the color is lovely it came to big so I altered it and it looked amazing on me
