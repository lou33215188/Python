I wore this dress to a job interview. I got the job. :)


Pros:Fit well, looked nice


Cons:Zipper is very particular as to when it wants to zip, and is very hard to zip. this may be due to the rip in the fabric along the zipper that we noticed upon its arrival. I did not have time to return it so i ended up wearing a jacket overtop. to cover the hole.


perfect fit; love it


It fit great, was beautiful, and came as expected. It is also a little stretchy, so it made for a more form fitting fit. I am very glad I bought this dress.


The dress is a bit long on me since I am short, but I kind of expected that anyways. The floral print walks a fine line between cute and old lady-ish.


Love this dress!


I read all the reviews prior to ordering, so I am pleased with the fit.  I wear a size 16-18, and I normally wear an XL. I ordered a 3XL in this dress--yes, that number killed my self-esteem and pride--but it fits perfectly and looks great. I plan to order a few more!


ordered a larger size so the fit is good...got lots of compliments and it is very comfortable


The dress fit perfectly! I got a lot of compliments the day I wore it.


Cuuuute Dress! I love how it fits and the material is nice with just a hint of stretch for us curvier girls.
