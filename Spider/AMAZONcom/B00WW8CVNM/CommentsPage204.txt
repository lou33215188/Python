Thank you


First dress I've ever bought online that fit!


Very cute !  Very retro-stylish!!


fits perfect


love this!!


I'm 5'7 and weigh 230lbs. I got this for a cruise as a last minute replacement for a dress I had that is now to big. I ordered this in a 4x and although it fits good I could of gotten a 3x. The material has a little stretch to and and it is really nice. Better than I was expecting.


Nice dress, but a bit too tight. Best to order one size larger


Very nice fit for a teenage girl.


Great dress and very affordable.


This was A magnificent  purchase. Owen Thanks.
