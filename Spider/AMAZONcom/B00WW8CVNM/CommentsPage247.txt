Lovely dress! The material isn't as soft as I expected but it fits nicely


I got a large. I am 5'6 155 lbs. It was somewhat large, especially in the top. There is no way to get it taken in without making it look worse. I love the colors though!


Style is cute and  comfortable


Even though I bought a bigger size assuming it would run smaller it's a gorgeous dress. I would recommend this.


I fell in love with the print and style of this dress. I was deeply saddened when I


 discovered that there was more me then dress.  It will remain on my wish list as an incentive.


I would recommend this dress as a thumbs up that run small.


Very nice


Very beautiful dress...es I tried to cancel 2 dresses in my order but too late and No easy return directions. The dress itself, too high waisted but i love the kind of dress. Thank you for a beautiful dress!


Just what I expected, so pretty!


I didn't like the fit but it's a cute dress.


Gave this four stars because the chest area was a bit small. Got it adjusted and it fits perfect. I wish you sold 16w that would work better. I will be ordering again
