Well suited for tall women.


Size fits good but it's meant for petit women with not a large bosom


it fits great and has a good quality fabric!


Love this dress.  It fits perfect!


Absolutely amazing, I feel like such a lady!


Wonderful dress!


I ordered a dress one size larger than I normally wear because I know that sizes in China are much different than they are in the US.  The skirt fits fine but the top is too tight and is nowhere near the measurements listed in the sizing chart.  The neck is also bit too high and feels like it is choking me.  I am not going to send it back because it would cost too much-I am steadily losing weight so it will fit properly in time.  Nice stretch fabric, light weight, but too small.  I took a gamble and lost.
