Nice dress but way too smal


Very cute. Fits nice. Good material.


Great fit


It washes well I have worn it many times


Not good at all! Nice on a pic, but when I got it..... No,no, no!!!


This is a beautiful dress.  According to the size specification I needed a medium.  However it runs a bit small across the chest so I must return it for a large.


Beautiful fabrics. However fit was small and material wrinkled badly when washed.


I get so many compliments on this dress! Not the most comfortable fabric, but not scratchy to wear. The fit is very flattering.


The skirt is longer than it looks in the picture, I think, but it's a lovely fabric and very elegant.


I have never gotten so many compliments on a dress before (besides my wedding dress!) Beautiful quality, can't beat the price, vivid color, absolutely a best buy!
