It was too short.


This is a beautiful dress! Nice flow and pleading.


It is a cute dress for the price.


Dress is more a fit and flare and not a full skirt.


Beautiful, wonderful and hot so many compliments!!!


Got so many great compliments love the dress


This is a very pretty dress. Just runs a bit too small


Not just the size, this is the most cheap looking dress I have seen in my life. It does not have any pockets


even with under slip the slip looks nicer. Just don't waste your money. And Amazon took long enough to


refund my money. Never again, don't buy this dress.


perfect


For as expected, zipper catch is smaller than I'd like but still good
