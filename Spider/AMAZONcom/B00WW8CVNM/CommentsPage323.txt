Loved it


Love this dress!! Looked amazing on and I got lots of compliments!


Let down the siezes run smaller than indicated!


It is a nice dress but it went down to my  ankles and I'm 5'3. Not how it shows in the picture.


Perfect!!!!


Perfect fit and length , I was totally surprised.


Stretchy material, tight fit across the bust (I am a 32C) but a medium would be too big. Very happy!


I'm so glad chosen this dress, it is gorgeous and fitness perfect.


Love it
