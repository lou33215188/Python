Beautiful.  I did have to put in a new seam along the back due to being able to see the salvage edge of the pattern.  It was a simple fix and I love this dress!  Fit like a glove.


This dress...I did my research and read comments and decided to go for it. I am glad I did. I got so many compliments. I will be buying another for my graduation soon.


Such cute dress! The style is very retro and adorable. Nice lines and cut. The polka-dots are slightly bigger than I expected but not too big.


I was afraid of buying a dress off of here due to horror stories I have read or heard about online clothes shopping and due to having a large busy size gauging what size to order can be frustrating but the size I got is perfect I very much love this dress.


My daughter didn't like the material and it was a little large for her. I am thankful we were able to return it. It was a beautiful style of a dress.


The dress was incorrectly sewn.  I had to pick it out and resew it.  I don't like that.  I want my granddaughter to put it on and be excited.  But it now looks good on her.


Love the dress -- style, color (floral/gradient purple), and fit (very flattering). Plan to wear it for an afternoon wedding reception on the water. I'm 5'7" -- small on top, wide hips, generally wear a size 12 -- so ordered a large. The dress fits me well / flatters my top and waist and comes just below my knees.


The dress is smaller in the chest/waist than a traditional American Medium. It is beautiful and it fits just a bit more snug than most dresses.


I ordered this dress for my daughter's homecoming dance.  I wasn't sure what to expect because the price is SO cheap, but it turned out great!  Looking closely, at the stitching and seams inside, you can see that this is a lower quality dress, but when you are wearing it, it looks very classy and looks great!


The dress is beautiful it runs a bit small but I was able to make it work for a wedding. Very well made.
