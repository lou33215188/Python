fit nice stitching was a little strange on one shoulder, but easy fix


LOVE IT! Planning to buy more in different patterns. Buy the petticoat slip... makes the look


The dress is cute but not very well made.  My size is 8/10 or a M. With this dress I think I would need a XL. I will be returning it.

I love this dress.  Beautiful and very flattering.


I received this dress today and I absolutely love it. The fit is perfect, I'm 5'10 and normally wear size 8, but I ordered a L and actually could have ordered a medium but it would have been a little snug in the chest. I do hope the colors hold up. I'll be ordering another one.


Gorgeous dress. Fits well and is comfy. Order a size up if you don't want it super snug. Also, it was a bit long but hemming is easy. Nice material and fantastic colors.


I got compliments with this dress, it is so pretty!


It's a little baggy towards the top, but the print is gorgeous. After the first couple of washes, it should fit perfectly. It arrived much faster than expected.


Adorable and a nice summer dress.


Material is to be desired, you will need a slip, I'm 5-4 and it came to the knee
