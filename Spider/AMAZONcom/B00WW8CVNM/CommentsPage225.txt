I love this dress.  I will buy more retro dresses


Product was well made, well packaged, arrived on time and looked as beautiful as I had expected


OK, so I didn't get this until today but it was in my mailbox Saturday and I love it!


 It's super super cute.

Buy larger size than normal.


I love this dress.  Plan to wear at work just need to have a sweater or somethingover it becauseI need to have some sleeves. But once I'm off I'll wear as is.  I did purchasea petticoat to go under to have the body that the pic has.they work well together
