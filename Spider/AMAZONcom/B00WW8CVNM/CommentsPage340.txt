I like this a lot. The colors and fabric are nice and soft


Totally beautiful but way too small.


This dress ran small especially in the bust!


Fast shipping and what i expected


The pattern was as expected and beautiful. The neckline was too high, like choking me too high. I'm petite so I knew that the length might be a little long, it was. Overall the material was cheap and the quality of sewing was very poor. What bothers me the most is that the neckline was so high I can't imagine it to be wearable for anyone. I bought the Purple Floral Scoop Neck.


The dress came faster than I thought& fits great!!!!! I so loved the look...


Pretty, feminine dress!


No


This is a beautiful dress, but the fabric is very thick and hot.  I ordered two sizes larger than I usually wear and it arrived labelled as that size but the fit was about two or three sizes smaller that I wear.  Extremely small at the bust.  The waist was way too short for me as well.  It seemed to be more of a child's size than an adult's.  I had to return it.


Yes
