Okay I'm literally OBSESSED with this dress. I am 5'6 1/2, 175lbs and went with a Large. It fits like it was tailor made for my body and I've never been so excited to wear something. Having an hourglass shape, it's hard to find something that is small enough in the waist but that still fits nicely up top. This dress is SO PERFECT.

Needed a new hem at bottom, too long.  Have not worn yet.


The dress if lovely but too small for me.


I absolutely LOVE this dress! It has quickly become one of my favorites! However, it fits a little snug to the point that I can't even zip it myself. I wish that I had gotten one size larger so that there would be a little breathing room.


Looks great on the wife, she loves it.


Very nice. I like the colors a lot.
