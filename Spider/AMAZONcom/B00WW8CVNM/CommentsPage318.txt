Well made and fits nicely


Fit everywhere but mid section.


I bought it for me, but my teenage daughter liked it more 5"4 - 125lbs


it was a nice dress, I like it


These dresses are perfect! I get compliments each time I wear one.  Very flattering for girls with hips.


Love this beautiful dress!!


But not the color I purchased. I like purple, but got a red flowery one


Dress fit great and I was told that very nice and great color


I ordered this dress in the beautiful green color and am so pleased with how it fits. I will definitely be ordering more colors!


I loved this dress so much I ordered another. However, the size fits are completely inconsistent. If it weren't for that detail, this would be a 5. I ordered a 3x, and it fit beautifully. I loved the dress so much, I ordered another. It is NOT a 3x, but it still fit, so I kept it. It was just a little snug. If they paid attention to their sizing, I'd probably order more of these, but that second dress scared me a bit, so I think I'll keep it at two.
