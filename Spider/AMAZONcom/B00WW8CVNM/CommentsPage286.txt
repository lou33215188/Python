I love this dress. I also purchase a petticoat to go underneath which made it look even better.


Super cute, nice fabric weight for wear with crinoline, color is as I expected.  I'm very happy!


Pretty :)


It fit all my BrownGirl curves! Wow, I am blown away at this dress. I got the red and the white with flowers. I measure myself to be sure I picked the right size and viola! Awesome Dress! I want them all!


Nice product with a horrible fit.  The dress ran big and I had to get it tailored


I love this dress!!  So pretty and the length is right on trend


Flattering and comfy


The price was cheap, the dress is cheap.  I bought a Medium - am size 10... could barely put it over my head UNZIPPED.


love it fits well fabric is nice looks great on


Good material,  nice but a little small for size  in bust
