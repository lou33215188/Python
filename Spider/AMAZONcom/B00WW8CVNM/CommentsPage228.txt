A little tight around the rib cage area. But I love this dress.. Great quality fabric.


Cute dress


Lovely dress!


Arrived cheaply made, not made of cotton at all. Too small, even though I ordered a size larger. They only offered a 20% refund since it is coming from HongKong. I get to keep the dress, however it does not fit so what good is it.


i loved the dress just will never fit me made for a small woman even in plus size


Sizing is way too small...came with a hole in zipper area.


Fit perfect!! So girly!!! Perfect for date night family pictures and such.


I love the fit so I bought another one!  Lots of compliments on the fit!


Very lovely. Bought it for my sister bday and she loved it. Fabric is great not too heavy or thin. Color is as expected based on photo. Over all I'm very pleased.


It was so long!! Very big all over
