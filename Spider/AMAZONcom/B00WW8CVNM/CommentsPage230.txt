Ordered for my daughter's Sweetheart Dance. Got here in 3 days, 2 days sooner than expected. She is normally a size 18/20, so I figured with internet sizing to get a 3X. Well, she barely squeezed into it and got it zipped. I would say the sizes are running small by a bit.


I love this dress, It fits great! Well made and a steal at this price!


Very happy. Got tons of compliments. Shipped in time


Too granny like


I followed the sizing chart and it fits perfectly.  I get lots of compliments every time I wear it.


I LOVE this dress! I loved it even more with a petticoat to fill it out! It also feels really good quality :D


This seriously fits perfectly.  Stretches I will buy more in different colors


Love it!! Love the Fit!  I have big hips and the dress looks so good on me glad I bought 2 gonna buy more


Such a cute dress I LOVE it ~!


Dress was fine I ordered the wrong size.
