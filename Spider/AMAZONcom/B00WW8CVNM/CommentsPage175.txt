I love it and I would buy more in different colors because I love the way it looks and fit


The dress was too short and the back zipper was difficult to pull up.  Typically, Amazon doesn't give the length of dresses or skirts.


Very nice.


I like the dress, but the waist bunches a little bit


Nicer than I feared. Super cute online but I worried about size and fit. While quality is more "target", fit was not. I'm very happy with it for the price.


fit great but the arm was a little to big had to do minor adjustment


I have a few of these dresses and they fit perfect. Unfortunately the last two I ordered were shorter so I sent them back.


Too large


I love it!
