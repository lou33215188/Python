I just love it..amazing fitting..it just beautiful


This fit perfect!!!! Great dress but it had a spot on the dress.


I just got the dress yesterday. It is wonderful! It fits perfectly!!! I am so pleased. I will be purchasing more today! Thank you!!!


I followed cleaning instructions and the colors bled.  The dress is ruined.


fits beautifully.  Very attractive, well-made.  Good Summer dress.  I like that it is cotton with a little bit of stretch.


Somewhat large even though I went according to the size chart.  Longer than it appears to be in the picture. I was hoping for s nice tea length dres but this falls awkwardly at my calfs. There is no slip or underling so it is very lifeless at the bottom and could be see thru in bright lighting. If you are looking for a nice 50's retro looking dress this isn't it. Unless you are going for the 80's look


A beautiful dress I love it so I ordered 2 others with different patterns. I ordered a small and I usually wear a small or 4 it fits nicely. Came much earlier than expected.


A bit longer than I expected, and a higher neck line, but still pretty.


Great dress and fabric butKust toi long  for me


I love this dress! It's so flattering.
