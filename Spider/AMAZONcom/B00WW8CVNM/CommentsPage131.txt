Very pretty dress!!  I would definitely order another but in a different color.


I bought my size according to the size chart, and couldn't even get it on. Way too small.


I love this dress I bought it in this color and the blue and white also.  Also bought the blue and white one for my granddaughter because she loved it so much


do not order if you are a plus size. very very very small


the belt piece ripped after a wore it twice and I wasn't pulling on it


Was expecting a softer fabric so I returned it but very pretty


Definately does not look the same as picture.  Not only too small but the fabric seemed really cheap.


The sizing of this brand is ridiculous! I could barely get the dress over my head. I will never purchase from this company again. Hopefully I can return it. Too bad, because it is so very pretty!


This is a very flattering comfortable and breathable dress. Love how small it makes my waste look. However for a plus size woman I found it snug in the chest, and I have a small chest for my size. So I would recomend ordering a size up if you are a c cup or more.


I love it
