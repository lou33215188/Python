Beautiful dress. It has a bit of stretch to it which adds to the comfort.


Beautiful dress. Very classy. Ordered a size bigger and it fit perfectly!


It is somewhat long and my wife is 5.6' but otherwise is cute and well made.


small


nice dress


The pattern is lovely


Medium fitted my 5'4 in height 140lbs body. The skirt goes past my knee which is a bit too long compared to the usual dress I wear but that is easily adjustable. The fabric is very good quality and very comfortable to wear.


Perfect. At first I was concerned that quality might be bad because the price was so good, I was totally wrong. This dress is well made, and fits well. I thought the print might be too much from the photo (my bf said it looked like a curtain), but it's perfect. I'm so happy that I took a chance and ordered.


the fit is smaller


If you are like me and like vintage flair, you will adore this dress.
