The dress itself is amazing, the print is clear but the fit was terrible for me. I have a very small chest so I had a lot of extra fabric up top and Im petite so there was a lot of dress at the bottom. But nothing a tailor wont be able to fix for me! Dress came sooner than expected and I would order from them again.


Great deal. The fabric is not flimsy and the dress has structure, while still being comfortable. I'm very happy with how it looks on. I'm 5'7" 165 and a Large is the size I went with. I was a little concerned that it would be see through or flimsy since the fabric is so lightweight but it isn't. Does seem to wrinkle easy though.


Extremely flattering fit! This garment is well made.  The flowers were not the first choice for the print but the cut and quality make up for it!


Nice fabric, fits perfectly, the skirt moves nicely as you walk. In other words, it makes you feel gorgeous!


Very pretty, which is why I gave it two stars.  But the XL fits like a small.


I love this dress! I feel so pretty when I wear it! It fits exactly how it should.


Very cute! Wish the waist hit a little lower the waist is kinda high for me but I'm very tall so.... Haha.


We went to a 50's theme wedding. This dress was perfect!  Plus it was so comfortable too!


Love this dress. I have gotten constant compliments and multiple people have asked me where I got it. The only downside for me was the fabric. Not great but for the price, it didn't matter too much to me. I have seen a lot of reviews stating it was far too small. I bought according to my actual measurements regardless and it fit perfectly. It seems hit or miss in this respect, which is unfortunate as this is a really flattering dress if you get the fit right!


I love the fit, material, and length. I felt beautiful, classic, and chic!! LOVE this dress!
