It fits really well, and I love the fabric, unfortunately it's extremely light weight, so if it's really windy outside it isn't the best outfit to wear that day, other than that I am very happy with it.


Perfect! The dress is better quality than I expected for the low price and it fit perfectly! I am very pleased.


Just as described. Came as promised


There is a good bit of stretch in the material so it is really comfortable. Everyone loved it.


Wore this dress for my backyard wedding and got a lot of compliments on it.


It was a bit longer than I thought it would be but it was an easy fix. I got out my sewing machine and took some length off the bottom


dress was for my sister and it fit perfect ... knee lenght ... shes 5'2" and its an xl .... perfect fit


I thought it would fit just a bit different, seems a tad small


Love my dress! It was  delivered on time.


Because stitching was very bad...my dress zip came off when i opened it..it doesn't look as it appears ..I totally dislike this dress.
