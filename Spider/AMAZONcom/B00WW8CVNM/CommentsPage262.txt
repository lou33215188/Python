The fabric was a lot more stiff than I thought it would be. When I tried it on, it looked very nice. I am in love with the pattern.


Vibrant colors and gorgeous dress.. Planning on wearing to a summer wedding.


runs way too small not true to size


Absolutely love this dress!


I got the cherry one in black, size XL. Only thing I didn't expect was that the dress was made mostly of polyester, when I thought it was going to be cotton throughout. Fit well.


Beautiful dress ğŸ‘— & shipped faster then expected


Nice dress, was a little longer than expected, as I'm 5'8" and it's below mid calf on me.


but it ok


Dress fit was smaller than expected but store provided excellent customer service for my return


I love this dress!
