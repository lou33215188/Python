it fits beautifully and has a little stretch to it, so sitting down, moving around or even eating didn't make it uncomfortable.


This dress is unusually long and reaches between mid calf and my heels.. Don't like it.. It's just an odd length.


very cute dress with vibrant colors.  Better than expected and the price was amazing.


It was a beautiful dress and well made!


It's lovely!


The dress is super cute, & very comfortable! I absolutely love it!


Sizing was spot on, material was nicer quality than expected. Only issue is that the neckline gapes a bit for me. No big issue, it is a minor alteration, but otherwise it would be five stars.


Love it.


Gave this as a gift, fit exactly as it needed to and was adorable.


The material is not good.  The back ripped as I sat down.
