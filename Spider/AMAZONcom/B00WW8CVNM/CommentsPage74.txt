I loved this dress so much, that I wore it to work the day that I opened the package. A little bit loose on the top but still looks good.  I bought a second dress after seeing how well this one looked.


Absolutely dreadful! Seams are ripping and all over the place upon arrival. I was hoping to wear this to a memorial that I have coming up but this dress is so badly sewn that I would be absolutely embarrassed to wear this in public. Also there is no lining to this dress and fabric is thin and see through. Check out the pictures I took. I guess I was one of the un lucky ones.


Great fitting dress & extremely cute complimentary; however, need to hem it up the nlue floral about 8" but that's no problem. Worr the purple floral to a wedding & received multiple compliments ğŸ˜†


I am right between too sizes. I decided to go smaller, should have gone with the bigger size. The dress is cute and just what I wanted, just a tad too tight. Returning for bigger size. I hope it's perfect.


Beautiful dress! I love the fit.  The size does run small,  I wear typically wear a 1x and ordered a 3x due to other reviews and it fits perfect.  So order 2 sizes larger than normal.


Very good quality for the price. Love the vibrant colors and different options for the same style. Only downside is the fit was a bit big on me.


The dress is beautiful. I am only 5 ft short so the dress is very long I will have it altered. for the price the dress is great. I usually wear a 10-12 and the Large fit great.


Love this dress I plan on buying more in different colors. The fit is spot on and for the price it is quality made. Very comfortable to wear and you can dress it up with some extravagant accessories or wear it simply with pearls.


Had to order up 2 sizes. Didnt fit too well.. the shape is a little odd... but not enough for me not to wear it. Minor adjustments and it works well. Fabric is thin but not see thru. It looks nice on. Overall i like it. Has a nice flow to it.


Beautiful dress. Especially for the price. I was actually surprised at the quality, the material felt like a more expensive dress  If you have big breast would suggest that you buy a size up.
