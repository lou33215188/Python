Like the dress, you can't tell the tie on the back. Did not like that


Good fit for flat chested person. I am not. Quality seems good tho.


I bought for my mom and she looked good as well as fit was flattering on her.


Bigger in the chest area but it is BEAUTIFUL! and I can make it work I love it!!


Really fast shipping. Ordered Saturday and got it Wednesday. It fits well and was very professionally packaged. The fabric is thin, which is perfect for summer and still has space to add under layers when it gets cooler.


CLASSY


Definitely like other reviews say, it is a little small, so go one size up. I usually wear a size 14 or XL and 36D, so I ordered a XXL and fits fine, a little big around the arms and neck, but nothing that a little fold can't fix. Very happy with the fabric. It is long, so make sure to ck the length if you are ordering a petticoat for volume. I got the red floral, and really want to order more!


This dress is not a good choice for a tall person. I am 5'9" 136lbs, usually don't have too much trouble with my dress purchases, it doesn't fit in the torso, about 3 inches too short. The dress is cute though. Wish it fit. Zipper isn't set in properly, it's not opened all the way up at the bottom of the zipper so that you can get full use of the zipper.


Wore it once before it had a hole in it, wore it a total of three times before the zipper broke. Not made with quality by any means, but for under $20 what do you really expect? Perfect to wear once or twice, but not something you can expect to have for a while.


My daughter absolutely loves it! Good quality fabric and it falls very nice. Slightly big, but that is what I wanted so she will be able to enjoy it for  years to come. I'm sure I will be ordering more for her in the future. Many thanks from a very satisfied customer. ğŸ˜Š
