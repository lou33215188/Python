Beautiful dress! Fits me great! The only thing is the belt that came with it is waaaay too small! I ordered a 2x and the belt fits my 6 year old skinny kid, no way fits a 2x women. Otherwise, I LOVE this dress!


I love the dress but it was a little small for the size but I can still wear it with a jacket or sweater. It is a beautiful dress and it is made to look expensive. Yes I would definitely recommend ACEVOG to everyone who loves the 50's and 60's dress styles as I do. Great customer service also and the picture of the dress is exactly what I received very pretty.


Love this dress. It was my Easter dress. Received several compliments. I am only 5'2" and the dress length was perfect. May have been too short on someone 5'"


Ordered an extra size larger based on the other reviews.  Dress fit perfectly on my daughter!  She is 5'8".  I'm 5'4" and the dress felt too long for me.  Loved the pattern and the style.  Well made, and material has just a little stretch to it.


It's well made, especially for the price. But even using my actual waist measurement, the 2XL was still far too large (by at least five inches) in the waist, huge in the shoulders, and didn't fit the bust at all.


My measurements for reference: 43-36-43.


I love this dress! I'm not normally one for dresses and never wear them but for the price I thought I'd give it a try. It fits great and the material is comfortable. Not too much stretch to it so definitely order a size or two up. I ordered 2x usually wear L or XL. I'm 5'8, 190 lbs with 40dd chest. A bit tight on the chest area, and it's kind of longer than I'd like so I plan on hemming to about knee length.  Ordering a couple more colors for sure. Can't beat the price.


I bought the dress two sizes larger than I am a it fit like a glove! I feel like a knock out!! The material is nice and has a  little stretch to it. It  is well made and since I have prime it shipped in two days. All in all worth your time


I will edit my review after my event to add comments about wearing this beauty for a long day.


What a beautiful dress and the quality is great!


I like this dress, but it's a little tight around the bust for me and I'm not exactly busty.  I'm sure if I dropped a few pounds, it would fit better.  The waist and hips are great but I wear a 38B-C bra and got an XL.  It is stretchy so if you like a snug fit, it's fine.  I like a little more room myself, but a good dress all the same.


It's a cute dress it's a little big in the top area for me but the rest fits so I am going to have it altered no biggy. I also wish the skirt flared out a little more so I'll wear with a petticoat. Definitely the look I needed for Christmas this year ğŸ˜�â�¤ï¸�
