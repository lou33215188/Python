While this dress fit, the saying "you get what you pay for" certainly applies in this case.


The skirt isn't nearly as full as the skirt depicted (it is almost a straight skirt, not even A-Line) and the fabric is extremely poor quality. While I did order white floral (with black & red flowers), I didn't expect this dress to be see through! The fabric is so thin (almost sheer) that you would definitely need to wear a slip under this dress for the sake of modesty. Even then, I'm not sure I would be comfortable wearing it in public.


I think this one is for the Goodwill pile! :(


Somewhat small in the bust


It pretty but it wasn't what I thought


This is a beautiful  dress, but they run very small. I ordered 2 sizes up and it still fits very tightly.


So perfect! I love it!


Just a little baggy in front of the arm pits


It was super cute.... And fit well. But the boobs were small and smashed.


Fit very good


Nice dress but not right for me.


This is my new favorite dress! Love it.
