Too small and the material was not comfortable. It felt like a canvas drop cloth. Had to return it.


I was expecting a better fit. It does look well made and it's very pretty just didn't fit as expected so I'm pretty sad about that.


I love the color & design. I was concerned about the fit but it fits me perfect. I have a white petticoat to make it poof out....very feminine.


Did not like this dress at all.  It was way too big and I think you must be at least over 5'7" to be able to pull this off, At 5'2" I would have had to wear 12 inch heels....lol  Super Long will be returning as soon as I can get to the post office.


Love the dress and the fit!


This dress comes from China it was about 3 sizes too small. Very diisappointed


This dress is absolutely beautiful and I wish the fit was better. I had to return it, because is was just too small in the bust.


I loved the material, and the fit in the waist was great, The bust was way to small for me (38DD) and I had to return it. It was a beautiful find, I just wish the bust had fit me.


I love this dress. It reminds me of the 1940s. It fits well and is flattering. I love the spring like colors. My only complaint is it's a tad too short.


Really nice dress!  Pretty and excellent quality BUT just TOO small.  Disappointed.  If you're thinking about buying this dress, go up 2 sizes!
