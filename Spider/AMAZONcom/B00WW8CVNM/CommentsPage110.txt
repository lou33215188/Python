Beautiful print, wonderful fit. Classy


Bought this for my teenage daughter. I will admit,  at first I was skeptical. When she put it on, it fit like s dream! It fits her perfectly, and she loves it!


So pretty! I can't wait for the trip to wear it! This one was too small..I've gained some weight and reordered it..it's lost in shipment!


This is a beautiful dress.  I bought it for a '50s and '60s themed ball.  I wore it with long black gloves, black flats, and a strand of pearls, and I received numerous compliments on the dress and the look in general.  I may eventually end up with another one or two in different prints, especially since the price is so reasonable.

This is a great dress. I ordered it in black in a xxxl. I'm a size 20.This dress looks great on, it's a ladylike length, the fabric has both weight and stretch. It's sturdy, good seams so far. Also I'm a c-cup and I found the fabric sturdy enough that I felt comfortable whereing it without a bra.


The slim fit dress runs very small. The size on the Hepburn dress was perfect, but not the same as the slim fit. The slim fit medium needs to be extra large to match the medium Hepburn dress.


It fits perfectly and compliments my figure well. I really like this dress. The dress is exactly as pictured and described.


Love the dress...got plenty compliments


Hubby loved this dress, Fitted well pictures in this dress looks awesome; will order in future from this manufacturer
