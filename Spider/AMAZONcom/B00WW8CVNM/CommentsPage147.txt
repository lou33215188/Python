Arm holes are a little over sized.


I love this dress!  it fits perfectly and is very comfortable.  The material is nice (not thin like other dresses).


Dress sent was wrong size. Dress was not cotton, but polyester as well. Sending this disaster back. I wear a size 18. But ordered a 2x, because it was an import. Couldn't even zip it up. I sew so if it was too big I could take it up. There was no size tag in dress, which had me suspicious of size. I'm betting this is a size large. So very disappointed.


Love it!


Way longer than I expected.  I had to hem it so it wouldn't look frumpy. Good quality but made for a taller woman.


I am so happy with this dress. I got xxl and it fits perfect!


I absolutely love this dress. It is classy, yet casual enough for a picnic, and I love the print.


My only complaint is that the top kinda pops out a bit due to the size of my chest.


It is absolutely a perfect dress.  Pick your size based on measurements, but as a curvy woman, the XL fit perfectly.


I usually wear a medium (US size 8-10), but I ordered a large based on my measurements and it's slightly too large. But it still fits and looks really nice!
