It is ok, fit as expected, arrived as planned.


The arm holes are huge. Sending back.


I even ordered 4 sizes bigger ğŸ˜•ğŸ˜¤


Got it for my mom, she says it fits perfect!


I normally wear a large but I got an extra-large and the  bus area was still a little bit too small but I like the dress it self


Love this dress!  Fit is perfect - I wear a size 8 and medium fits just right.  I get so many compliments when I wear it.


This is comfortable and a well put together peice.


I order a 2 xl and it fits like a medium


I ordered the tight size but this dress runs very small


It's so pretty!
