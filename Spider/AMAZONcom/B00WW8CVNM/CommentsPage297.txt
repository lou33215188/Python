Size is not true - I ordered 1 size larger than I normally wear and can not even zip it up.


lil snug around the top but really a great dress


It's perfect. Fits very well. Very satisfied


Good quality and fit.


the size scale is way way off


Love it, get many compliments when I wear this dress. Plus love the price


The fit is OK, but the color seems brighter in picture, than in reality


Sizing is off- does not fit Canadian XXL, as advertised.


Excellent dress for the price. It's true to size with little leeway.
