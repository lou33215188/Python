waist wasn't quite as nipped in, dress does NOT have the structure pictured.


The dress was so "OFF" on the size, but the material and workmanship was above average.  The sizing chart was SOOOOOO  OFF!


Looking for something else from


ACEVOG  Vintage dresses . I purchased the medium and it fit perfectly . I weight in at 155.  The top was so snug it supported me without a bra . Love it  Love Love it


Love this dress! Its beautiful. I am 5'10 and 150 lbs I bought the large size. It fits great...other than the top is large on the sides so I am having them taken in, but I am small chested so that's probably why. Its a great comfortable dress!


Right now, I wear a 2X in most things. I bought this in a 3X just to be on the safe side. The dress I got can NOT be more than a XL or 1X in U.S. sizes. It's a shame because the dress is SO pretty. With a petticoat, it'd be perfect...in the right size.


These sizes are NOT US sizes.  The "XL" is MAYBE a size 10, the XXL is MAYBE a 14.  AND it costs more to pay for the return postage to China, so we just gave them away.  BE AWARE before ordering your size.


True to fit, Hangs beautifully with or without petticoat (sold separately - $10). Material is a very nice cotton blend. You will want to find places to wear this one to. It is so comfortable but looks very dressy.


I absolutely love this dress. I bought a 3x and it fit perfectly. The only negative I have is the zipper is on the cheap side, so be careful zipping and unzipping the dress. I would highly recommend this dress to anyone who is looking for a cute cheap dress.


I really like this dress. It has a high waist and hides my pooch, but if my pooch was bigger I would probably look pregnant. I love the print and I get compliements everytime I wear this dress.


I want to love it....but if you get the waist size the bust size is too big.....have to do alteration
