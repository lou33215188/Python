Got the 2x when I read the dress ran small I wear a 1x. The 2x dress was to small for me so I gave the dress to my daughter who wears a large it fit her fine.


So many compliments when I wear this dress for performances. Planning to wear it socially, too. Great dress for the price !


It arrived so quickly! It fit perfectly! I was a little worried with the weight I've gained and I'm already curvy. It was very flattering and everyone loved it! Ordering more


Sized smaller than what the average person would think.


This dress fits perfectly, even more beautiful in person. I absolutely adore it.


The sizing isn't accurate order one size larger than you would normally wear. Dress is very nice otherwise just s shame I can't wear it.


Was pleased with my purchase, after reading other reviews I went a size up and perfect fit, I did order a petticoat to complete the desired look


Love it


It is super cute, I got a lot of compliments about it. the collar seam is a little stiff but I can't really complain.


Beautiful dress with a perfect fit!
