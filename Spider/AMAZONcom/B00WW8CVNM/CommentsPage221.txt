I got this dress (saw it on a Buzzfeed article) and absolutely LOVED it.


Cutw


So CUTE!  I love this dress!  Arrived promptly and fit perfectly!  (I am 5'8" 134 lbs, 34D chest: ordered a Medium)


I love it. Just as I expected. Got 1size bigger. Perfect!


Beautiful dress but too large however it was easy to alter to fit.


Loved it! Went by the size chart I'm a size 16 US and bought a XL and it fit perfect! Definitely looking forward to buying some more


Satisfied.


Cute!


This dress is only okay. It fits ok, but there's something too simple about it. And it looks rather wrinkled even after ironing.


I love the dress but size too small and the fabric needs to be ironed which I was not expecting.  But I hav gotten compliments on the dress.  I would buy again in a bigger size and different fabric.
