fits perfectly, typically i am a dress size 8. order the XL


I like the style of the dress and the material is very light but it was very tight in the chest area but loose other places.


I'm a size 16/18 and the 3x fit perfect.Good thing size label dont matter to me just the way it fits


the dress fit but it had a hole under the arm and the pleats not holding ..so i have to tack them ....it looks like something i went by a seamstress and sowed


I absolutely love this dress! I am 5'3 and weigh 117 pounds. The fit is perfect!


really cute. a little tight around my arms, but i wore it to my wedding shower and it was great. lots of compliments


Beautiful dress but too big


Top - bodice area too small.


Bottom - Hip area large


It's a nice dress but not for busty ladies. I typically wear a 1X but I cannot zip this dress over my bust line.


Beautiful dress!
