I loved it so much I ordered a second one. I ordered them for a beach wedding in San Diego in May should be perfect.... Now to decide which one to wear!I'm small 32b so it fits me perfectly! It doesnt come with petticoat but for the price so what for $10-$13 you can order one.


She loves it and can't wait to enjoy it in the spring time! Great fit and style. Bargain for the price but took a month to get here


I'm 5'1" about 150 lbs and wearing a 38DD and size 10/12 jeans. I ordered a large. This dress fits perfect. A little long but I expected that, still wearable. I might hem it. Will be buying more from this company.


Sooooo in love!!! This is an amazing dress! Great quality and very nice fit!!!!


WOW.... !!! beautiful dress, I received so many compliments... everyone loved it !!!


I am 5.6 tall and 135 pounds I got a medium and the fit was perfect. I already bought three more...


This error may have been my fault, but this ripped the first time I wore it. It was easily fixed, but I was initially disappointed. The dress is beautiful besides that, very high quality. I'd say size up though.


This dress was way too small.  The waist was about 4" smaller than the listing on the size chart. The fabric is flimsy and the seams are weak.


Good quality, but sizing smaller than what was posted on size chart


Gorgeous and true to size


This dress was exactly what I wanted great fit super cute light and the length was perfect I read other customers comments that they thought the dress would be shorter it's tea length I got compliments and someone thought I made it I'll probably buy the other color for our fourth wedding invite this summer great buy
