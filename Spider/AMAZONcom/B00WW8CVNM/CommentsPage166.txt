Looks like a piece of curtain or tablecloth


The quality of the dress is nice but it was a tad bit to big at the top. I just wear a cardigan with it. It is a nice dress. I purchased a medium( I wear med 8-10)


This dress is very cute and it fit as expected!


beautiful dress, that fits like a dream.


This dress is great for a wedding or summer barbeque...


Will buy again


EXCELLENT!!! WOULD BUY AGAIN AT THIS SELLERS!!!


This dress is adorable! It fit perfectly. I love it.


it is one of the best dresses that i now own, it fits well and falls so gracefully giving a slim look, loved it


I got this dress and it is beautiful. Have worn it to work and all my co-workers love it. It goes wonderfully with my white cardigan and I can wear it for any occasion. And looks even better with a petticoat underneath to bring out the 1950s flare. Great job and will be getting another one soon!
