love the colors


I bought this dress for a gift but when I received was not what I saw in the photo the fabric  is rough and looks like a dishrag can not give away what makes me sad


It's a bit big around the bust and waist area bust it's still a nice dress.


Fits as expected and very cute! Looks great with or without a petticoat.


I love this dress. For a couple years I haven't been able to find a dress that actually looked good on me, but this one does. I normally wear L or XL but I got a XXL due to others reviews. It fits perfectly. It is not too short on me like most dresses are. The dress is good quality.


Glad I order 2 sizes bigger. Reading the other reviews helped. And looking at the pics of other customers wearing the dress.


Looks great. Good buy for the $


Pretty color, very high neckline that gapped oddly in the back. Not a good cut.


not the material i'd imagined, sold it to a friend vs the trouble of returning it.


Glad I ordered up a size it fit perfect! It was such a great dress to wear to a wedding. Got lots of compliments!!
