friends and family loved this dress


I Love this dress! It fits perfect. I came on time . I love it Love It !!!!!


Beautiful dress, unfortunately, too small. I'll keep it as it would cost almost what I paid for it to send it back. Also, secretly hoping I'll fit into it soon. :)


The quality of this dress is amazing. Size though is true too size. I should have listed to my gut and not what the comments people put in. So go by the waist size not anything else. Love love love this dress. I took it in and got it altered for 10 bucks. Worth it.


I ordered a small and it's much too tight. I'm 5 feet tall and 104 lbs.


WAY too small. i even ordered up a size thinking i would be ok. NOPE.  now i have nothing to wear for my valentines day dinner with my hubby of 27 years !!! NOT a happy shopper at all.


I bought this dress for a wedding next month. It came really fast, and it's so cute! The dress fits perfectly, except that it's a bit long for my taste (I'm 5'4", the dress hit me mid-calf. I was hoping for just about knee-length), but it will be super easy to hem. I already wore it to work one day, and got tons of compliments on it!


Had to return the first dress I order as it was too small so I ordered another one size bigger and had to return that dress also as it was even smaller than the first one. I loved the dress itself and would have loved to wear it:(


This is just too darn cute! Summery- good go to dress for shopping and such


Love love this dress. Tons of compliments when I wear it!
