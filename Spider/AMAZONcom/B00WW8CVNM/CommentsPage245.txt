Beautiful dress, but the top was larger than expected.


Exactly what I was looking for.  Love this dress.  It arrived way before scheduled time and I'm curvy so I ordered two sizes up which ended up being the perfect Fit.


The dress was definitely made out of excellent material. I would just suggest buying a size bigger especially if you are larger in the top area.


I'm an XL usually and I ordered a 3X based on the measurements and its a good thing I did.  Overall a good fit and good length.


Pretty dress. Comes in plus sized but not cut for a full figured woman even in larger size.


Just loner than expected. But then I found a vintage sundress made by my mom. It it the exact same length. My mom was 5'7"...I have shrunk to 5'3.5".


absolutely beautiful


Loved it lots of compliments


I returned this item. It was short in the waist. The hem was uneven and dropped down in the front.


Fits well, looks great for the price!!
