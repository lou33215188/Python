I love the style of this dress, its just perfect and the design is also nice


The dress fits well but the material looks so bad and it crumples immediately after ironing.


Amazing dress...Material quality is superb..I wear size 14 so ordered a XL and fit very nice with a little room to spear..


I absolutely love this dress. It is well made and fits me perfectly. I ordered it in a medium, and I do usually run an 8-10 depending on style (sometimes 12 if a dress is snug on the hips) so I would say it is true to size.  I ordered the red and black flower print and it looks great. There is more variation in the red flowers than I thought (some parts of them look pink) but I actually really like that, as I think I'll be able to accessorize it with more things. It was a bit longer than I expected, but at 5'3" that happens to me a lot with dresses.


I can't wait to wear this!


I think the dress shrunk  a bit after washing. Also it needed ironing to make it look good.


I love this dress. The colors are vibrant and beautiful it looks just like the picture and fits great  Im wearing it to a garden wedding next week


A bit small, but fits well on some areas, so no complaints, really


Because its a wonderful dress, my confidence level has also boosted by a lot, thanks a lot!


Loved it but the zipper broke the 2nd time I wore it... :(


Very pretty. I Love this dress. It's very comfortable.
