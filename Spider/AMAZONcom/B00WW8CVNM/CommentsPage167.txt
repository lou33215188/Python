Beautiful dress and it fits perfectly. Good material


I love this dress and plan on wearing it to our wedding rehearsal dinner!


Omgsh!!!! I am in loooove love love with this dress! It fits true to size & I ordered a 3x. I'm tall & fluffy and it hits right at the knee. Sooo flattering & femine! I ordered it in the black cherry print & the blue with white polka dot print, both are amazeballs & I will be ordering more!!! And talk about comfort!!! Thank you so much!!!


loved it. but a little tight in the waist. Ha ha


The dress fit perfectly and was extremely flattering. I absolutely adore it and would buy from this company again!!!


Love this dress! Very pretty.


I would have LOVED this dress if the bust would have fit. I did my measurements and ordered the dress according to the size chart - the waist and hips fit but my bust was too large :( This dress is GORGEOUS and I would have totally kept it if it fit.


Very pretty. a little small in the bust area.  But fits nice everywhere else.


Fit well, but a little longer than expected.


Fine quality. Great fit when you use THEIR size chart.
