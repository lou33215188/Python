I'm in love with this dress. It does seem to run a bit small though. My only concern is that there are no tags on the dress about what it is made of and care instructions.


The dress looked beautiful but the stitching was not great. There was a hole about an inch long at the top of one of the darts where the stitching was completely missed. It is really small in the bust (a common problem for me). But my granddaughter loves it so I finished sewing the dart and she will be wearing it on her vacation next week.


Love this dress!!!


It was too small according to the size chart. Good print though.


make sure to read size chart


Fabric for the top part felt cheap and didn't feel like it worked well with the skirt part, which is very thick almost canvas type of cloth. skirt part is very stiff as heavy as a result.


The fit is so nice, the fabric could be softer, but I love the look and the way the dress moves. I had a flutter when I had the perfect matching nail polish.


Order your correct size. It is ankle length. Pretty dress overall.


The dress is well made but is really short waisted and runs really small.


On the long side and the red is a bright red, not the maroon color shown.
