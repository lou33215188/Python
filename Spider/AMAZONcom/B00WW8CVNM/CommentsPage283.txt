Its ok! The material is not as expected though. The print is on point though


Beautiful!  It was a little right in the bodice and I'm a 4 or 6. I can wear it, but it's just a little snug. I've ordered a medium and am keeping the small in case I lose a pound or two!  Thanks!


the dress is beautiful, fabric is slightly thin but the finishing is great, Normally i wear 2X  and a 44DD I got the 3X and it was a little snug on the bust.


Beautiful dress and wish that I could have kept it.  They need to update their sizing chart. The XL should have fit but I couldn't even zip it up.


Very pretty and lightweight!


This dress is pretty but very bland. for a better fit i opened it up by cutting a v-neck


Very pretty, just as pictured. However runs smaller than expected.


This dress is cute, I hope to get one that will actually fit me!


Thank you so much for helping me get a larger size. My sister LOVES the dress!!! ğŸ˜Š


Love this dress! Easy care and fits great.
