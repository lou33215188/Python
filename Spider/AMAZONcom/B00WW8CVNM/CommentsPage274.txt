Disappointed in the fit.


Very pretty dress. Fabric is stretchy yet substantial enough. Dress works best with a petticoat underneath.


Dress runs very small  found out it is in asain sizes after purchasing  so order 2 sizes larger (or maybe 3)  and you should be fine, size chart attached to dress is not acurate


I'm a 12 and the X-large fits nicely.  The waist is just a little high for me though.  The fabric is very sturdy, which I like.


Edit after ordering 4 more ACEVOG dresses.  2 of the new ones I ordered, same size, were WAY too big.  Also, the picture for the red dress is NOT at all what the dress looks like.  It's not as long as the picture.  I returned the ones that were too big, for free.  So I'm reducing the stars to 2.


Size was too small compared to what i ordered


It's pretty but too small.


gift


I'm top heavy and only 5'3" after a few alterations it will fit perfect!


Dress was amazing. Quality and price were great. A little snug at the chest but the stretch material made it all work. I added a black petticoat to complete the look. I would buy this again.


Did not fit as expected, larger size than one of their other dresses so was disappointed
