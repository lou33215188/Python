The quality of the fabric was less than expected. The fabric was much thinner than I was thinking it would be. However, the dress fits well.


Oh my gosh I love this dress- it's comfortable,lightweight, modest and sexy! The only thing is that it came really wrinkled and they were hard to iron out- I'll have to see if they come out in the wash. Otherwise, I would get this in every color if I could!!! ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


The dress is very good for the price paid. A little bit long for me. Wish will come with the tutu to make it puffy


Fits beautifully. I recommend purchasing a shirt petticoat though.


I Ordered this and few other items for a 50's party. This dress came in a Ziploc like bag. The dress was completely soaking wet. It had mildew on it. The black and red flowers bleed on the white fabric. There were brown spots all over it. Totally disgusting. It smelled terrible. The box was dry and so we're my other 2 packages that were also in the box this did not happen during delivery. It was bagged wet. I can't express enough how disappointed I am and how gross this was.


I'm short so it was a little long on me but it also flares out when you spin so the length helped with modesty while dancing. I wear a size 34DD and the top fit comfortably and wasn't too tight.


Too long.


Everyone loved it. I really like the dress. I will recommend buying the fluffy slip to wear underneath it to make it more appealing.


It fits perfectly - I ordered a size larger.  Mid calf on my 5-3" frame.  True red.  Love the stretch.


Bought as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it and looks cute in it.  :)
