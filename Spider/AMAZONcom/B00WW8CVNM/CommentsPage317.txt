I will wear it its a little tighter than I expected in the chest but it will work. Love the pattern.


its very nice, but smaller than I thought it would be.


It's a little bit large for me but it doesn't matter because i use it for just performance.


tight in the bust for the size chart and returns have been hard.  no communication from request.  Size larger than you would expect.


Nice dress just wasn't my style.


Dress was not the color I expected but it fit great


fits perfectly


A little tight at the top, but love the dress


I got these dresses for my bridemaids. I think  they will work perfectly! :)


I loved the way it fitted on me, very nice and complemented my plus size body.
