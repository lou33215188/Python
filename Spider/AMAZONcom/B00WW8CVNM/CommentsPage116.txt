very short waist. Perfect for a shorter gal. I fooled around with the attached belt, removed it and sewed it into a cummerbund which I then sewed onto the front. Voila! dropped the waist and no one is the wiser. I love this dress and will buy more.


Order one size up.  I ordered the size I normally wear and ended up breaking the zipper in the back trying to zip it up.  I love the look and style though so I will give it 3 stars.


I bought this for my daughter and she LOVES it!


Gorgeous, flattering dress. I'm 5'2" 128 and ordered the small. It fit great and was the perfect dress for a fancy date night out for dinner and a show with my husband.


The dress is beautiful but did not fit me as well as it should have to give it to my daughter who is 12 years old and it fit her perfectly and she loved it


I have bought two of these now, in different patterns and always get tons of compliments!  Its made well and requires some ironing, but its so worth it.  Love love!!


Even using their special sizing chart this fit a bit tight. I normally wear a US XL (18-20) but bought a 4xl.


Waaaayyyy too small. It is also poorly made. There were strings hanging everywhere and the skirt does not go out or is as full as described.


Deffinately a beautiful dress and the quality is good. The only problem is that everyone was saying it ran small so I ordered a size up and it was much too big. I'm 5'3" and 125 lbs. I got medium. Next time I'll get small!


The dress reached ongoing as expected. The quality was ok it had a bit of stretch to it. Boutlght the blue and the color was as it appears in the photo
