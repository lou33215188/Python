Fit was spot on. Awesome dress.


Really lovely dress but fit is a bit small so i cannot enjoy wearing it


I'm 5ft 7 inches but the dress' waistline fit too high for comfort. I was going to wear a cute black belt with it but couldn't as it sat on my waist but the dress' waist was too high. I felt i was trying to pull it down to fit me better to no avail.


I loved it on


Again love the dress, fit well and super comfortable!!!


It was somewhat small and tight fitting. But after I added some water and ironed it, and stretched it a little bit, it fit.


Good fit, good quality


This dress fits true to size and is very flattering. It's a classic cut so it's always in style. I'm going to order a couple more in a different pattern!


Fit size was small and fitting. No room to breathe.


I need to return it my boobs are too big.
