Cheap and poor quality.  It came wrinkled.  Will notorder from here again. Returning ASAP.


I bought the black and red rose one and also the purple rose dress. These dresses are absolutely beautiful. The material is very good and comfortable. Good job ACEVOG!!! Will purchase more :)


Love this dress. It really flattered my XXL body type.  I haven't had a chance to wear it anywhere but it is a very pretty flattering cut!


Thick quality material. Great design. The zipper was a little jammed. I got this dress to add to my teacher dress collection.  With a cardigan and some heels it makes the perfect work outfit.


This dress is beautiful


Arrived quickly, I wear a 14 and got the XL due to others comments. It is a bit big. Nice fabric, appears well made. I look forward to wearing it.


Cannot adequately express how amazing this dress it.  The fit is absolutely perfect.  I am just discovering the vintage Hepburn style stuff and this definitely didn't disappoint.


Beautiful dress, I want one in every color. I bought small for my 5'3, 120 lb self. Looks great, It's nice to have a summer dress you can wear a bra with.


Either I have a very long torso or the waist doesn't sit exactly as it appears to in the picture.  I do like the dress but I think it could be more comfortable with some adjustments


There were many mixed reviews about sizing, so I wasn't sure what to get.  I wear a 12 dress and I purchased the large and it fits good.  Just a little snug through the ribcage but not uncomfortable.  The material is a bit thin, so I have ordered a petticoat to go under it to give it some fullness.  I think this would look better with a sash or oversized belt; however, it ties in the back, so I'm not sure how to do it without it looking bulky.  Overall, I was pleased with the purchase.
