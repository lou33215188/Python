Great look, fit just great. But basic washing will cause the fabric to bleed. Dry clean only or dont purchase this item.


Bought this for my daughter to wear to a 50's party. It fit well and she looked lovely in it!


I love the style and fit of this dress. It's somewhat tighter than I wanted, though it does still fit. I ordered the large, and I'm 5'8", about 176lbs, for reference on sizing.


bought XXL and I'm a size 12/14 with 38DD ... it's a snug fit in the chest (like everything is) and fits as if tailored everywhere else.  The pattern on the red roses are amazing.  This is so beautiful.


Loved this dress!!!!  I bought this dress for a 50's party and it was a hit.  Everyone went crazy.  I wear it with long black gloves and a black crinoline.


material is not that great, and it doesn't flare out that well and wrinkles easily cuz material is so thin. but for price, its fine


This fit great everywhere but the bust. The dress is beautiful but if you have large bust, it may not fit. Item was returned and refund was issued.


Dress was a hit with tulle underneath. Wish I had taken pics. Beautiful with the tulle it gives the dress more shapely.


Very flattering dress


What a wonderful dress! comfortable, pretty and so girly! It is pretty difficult to find vintage dresses for tall girls, but this one fit the bill. My dilemma now is having to come up with the closet space to accommodate all of the colors available!
