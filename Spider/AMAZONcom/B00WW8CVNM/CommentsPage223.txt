Arm holes are a bit tight.


Fit as expected. Material is nice.


Way to small. I ordered 1 size bigger than normal and it still didn't fit.


Pretty


The dress was smaller than advertised. It was made in China. Not sure if that had anything to do with it.


I usually wear a size Large and I am not able to zip this dress up. I love the dress though so I am going to keep it and hopefully one day I will be able to wear it.


This dress is somewhat cheap in material but was bought for a Halloween costume and worked great.  It fits well


Top is form fitting and bottom is flowing!  Received many compliments!  Love it!!!


fitted top, tight if you are busty...


Fit is perfect. And I love the cut of this dress. Good quality material. I am very satisfied.
