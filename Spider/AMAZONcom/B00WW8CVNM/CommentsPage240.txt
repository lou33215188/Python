I was hesitant to purchase this dress because I read some of the other bad reviews but this dress fits perfectly.  It was a little but long but that is because I am only 5 foot 2.  So happy with my purchase.


The cut and fit are fantastic!


Very pretty dress, only returned because I needed it a bit longer past the knees for my liking


Great party dress - fit as expected, packs well


I received the dress much sooner than originally stated. It was lovely. I was so excited to get it. But, it didn't fit. Maybe it would soon? Currently dieting and exercising- but ...  Anyway, I requested a return and am definitely satisfied with the service I received. Will shop here again!!


Only got to use it one time. Shrunk after first wash.


Excelent


Super cute, fit pretty much as expected. The only thing is the fabric is a bit heavy for summer in Texas, but no big deal! Just means no wearing it outside for long periods until it cools off. Great quality and great price.


Was a beautiful dress, but the size was off.


Nice dress like it.
