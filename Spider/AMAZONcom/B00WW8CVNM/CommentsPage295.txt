I love this dress


Really cute, but fit was very small.  Order like 3 sizes up.


Granddaughter selected as on wish list. She was very happy with it. Not only fit but lot nicer than she thought it might be.


Cute, lightweight summer dress. Need a good slip to keep from showing off your unmentionables though.


Runs very small, as stated. Darts on chest were extremely crooked.


Beautiful dress, got many compliments on it, Got it on time, fit like expected and can't wait to wear it again


Love the fabric. Love the fit. Will definitely be buying this brand again.


Perfect fit....Love it.


The pattern of the fabric is lovely, the material heavy (kinda like a light sailcloth) the bodice is very nice and flattering, but the skirt was much fuller than expected from the picture, and the skirt hem seemed unfinished.  Maybe the hem was left that way on purpose so you can more easily fit the dress to your height, but I didn't see that in the description, and was not expecting to have to alter the dress.  the bodice was a little tight around the bust line for me but otherwise okay.  With a few minor alterations, the dress will be lovely to wear.
