I like this dress. It's very flattering and perfect to wear to work at my conservative company. It is not lined so I may wear a slip with it. Great value for the price.


Before purchasing I read reviews stating this ran small.so I sized up to a 4X to ensure I had enough room for my bust. I tried it on and I'm swimming. I'm normally a size 18 in ladies and with a 38DDD  bust it's hard to gauge sizing properly without trying it on first. But other than that I love it the fabric is nice to wear spring-fall Nd after some alterations ill be wearing this out for a night one the town :)


I love this dress and will be order more from the company. It fits perfect. I received so many compliments.


First and foremost, my wife looked super sexy with this. It highlights all the right places and makes the wearer all the more beautiful.


When I but clothes in the future, I will definitely use this seller.


Read the size chart!!!!! I'm a 2x normally and the 4x almost fit - for me it was still tight everywhere but there was a gap in the front of the arm holes. Style has tie above the waist and it made me look pregnant (at 57). Both the 2x and the 4x went back. Gorgeous dress and I sooooo wanted it to fit and wear it on my honeymoon.


The seem at the bottom wasn't straight & it was noticeable shorter on one side


Soooooo I was super excited for this dress BUT I got a 3x which fits perfectly pretty much always and this did NOT fit well. The top is too tight and the material feels cheap. I don't really like that BUT it gives me motivation to slim down I guess. ğŸ˜�


I work in the sewing field so I know fabrics and workmanship. This dress has both! It fit really well due to the little bit of spandex in the fabric. I was very pleasantly surprised. The price is a steal!


I ordered a size up but it was too big. The fabric is nice and thick at the skirt, its long. Waiting to order a M, which should fit better. I'm 5'5" and ~154 lbs.


I like the fit and the material. I wish it was a tadbit longer, for my size.  However, I am enjoying the dress.
