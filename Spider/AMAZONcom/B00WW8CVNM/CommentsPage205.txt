seller cancled this order.


Didn't like the material at all and it was tight across the chest area.


I took my measurements and due to wider hips ordered a size up. It was roomy but I was so excited that it looked really good.It didnt make me look fatter. If I had time I would've sent it back and ordered a size smaller. But over all I absolutely LOVE it!!! It came the next day!!! and the price was great. I am very satisfied!!!


was a nice dress but I ordered a size too small and had to send it back. I will have to re-order.


I loved it it fitted beautifully, loved it. Looked elegant. Great dress


I just love this dress and I get so many compliments when I wear it.


I knew going in that the bust portion might be challenging (LOL) and it is!  The waist and skirt portion is fine.  I'm keeping it.  Maybe alter it for fit since I sew.


Not for a busty women, even if you buy larger size, just no room for a chest, it's a short torso cut dress, material feels comfortable


This dress was a little longer than expected, but super cute. I got lots of compliments when i wore it.


Material is kinda stretchy so is very comfortable
