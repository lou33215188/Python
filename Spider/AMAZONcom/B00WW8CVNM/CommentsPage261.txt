Way too small for the size it said it was


I really like this dress.  The color is very vibrant and the fit was great.  It fit me perfectly and I usually have trouble with dresses because of my pear shape.


The dress did not turn out the way it is shown in the picture. The dress is not flowy but rather falls straight like a maxi. I'm 5'5 and the dress came uptil mid legs.


I love this dress. I got lots of compliments and it fit just right.


Returning - beautiful dress but way too small.


Loved the last dress I ordered. Ordered the same size and it's twice a big.


I love this dress! The fit is perfect! Thinking of buying additional color offers. Thank you!


Seams immediately starting coming undone (the zipper, the hemline).  Initially I sewed up all the problem areas, but once the darts at the bust started unraveling as well I just gave up.  Very disappointing as the dress was pretty and fit well.


I purchased it for myself & showed it to my daughter, said its really cute on.  I would buy it again


I love the cut and style of this dress.  Fits perfectly!
