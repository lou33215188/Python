This dress is beautiful. It is a bit more plain than it looks on the pictures but I think that makes it even better. The color is vibrant, the length just right and it was so comfy ğŸ’‹â�¤ï¸�


I would buy another dress but in a small size. The dress was so cute, I gave it to my friend who had a larger top. I am 5/4 weighs 158. I am curvy on the bottom so the flare on the dress work great. My top is small and so I would've fit perfectly in a small. Love the design.


Wow, I doubted this dress, but it is really great.  I ordered a medium - I am 5-8 145.  The fit is snug but not too tight.  The arm openings are a little odd, but for the price, not a problem.  The top is modest, and the dress hits at my knees.  These is no liner or petticoat, so it will need a slip.  The stitching is the back is a little off, but not noticeable and doesn't affect the fit too negatively.


Some people mentioned stains or marking on the light colored dresses - I did not see any of this.


Love, love, LOVE this dress.  I usually wear a 4, or 6 (depending on the maker).  After reading the reviews and considering my build, I went for the Medium.  Purchased a petticoat to give it the full 50's flare, and it looks great.  Wore it to my sister's fancy-hat bridal shower, and it was a total hit (pared perfectly with the fascinator that I purchased from another Amazon seller).  So happy I made the purchase, and I will be buying one of the polka-dot dresses as well!


The floral print makes this dress perfect for a Kentucky Derby party/tea/church (anything fancy/girly!)


The colors in this dress were really pretty, hence the three stars. However, everything else was a one or two stars for me. I had to return it as it was too small. And not just too small where I couldn't zip up the back zipper. It was also small in the scaling. The waist was higher than it should be, the arm holes were too small, and the neckline was higher so it didn't lay flat across my collarbone. The fabric is a stiffer cotton - it didn't feel soft and it did wrinkle a bit. That may not be a deal breaker for some, but I hate ironing and I like soft clothes. I really wanted this dress to work - disappointed it didn't.


Great Design and material (which stretch). Bought the S size based on the size chart and its  tight fit on 34 bust and wraist 27.  Should have size up as recommended by other reviewers.  Definitely the size chart is 1 size smaller.... so S is a XS, and M is a S for this seller's ACEVOG.  ITs really beautiful.. and a little lengthy for 5"3. With petticoat, it should be better


Pros - modest style with full coverage, goes past my knees, beautiful colors and cut of dress


Cons - the bodice seems too long and very baggy around the shoulders/neck area, the fabric of this dress is a plain, standard low thread-count cotton, so I am not sure how it will hold up to many washings.


Overall - I really like this beautiful dress, though I wish the bodice fit better and the fabric were sturdier.  I will take in the fabric at the shoulders and hope the fabric holds up.


I absolutely adore this dress! It's beautiful, and super flattering.


I'm a very small woman, only 5'2'' so this dress stops about mid-calf on me. I was rather nervous at first, because generally when a dress/skirt stops there I just end up looking ridiculous and frumpy, seeming all the more shorter. Needless to say, that isn't that case with this dress. It really does accentuate all your best features, while doing a great job at hiding a lot of "Problem Areas".


I give this dress 5 stars because I absolutely love it and I get so many compliments when I wear it!!! You do have to order it a little large though... If I had bothered taking my measurements and not continued to live in denial I would have ordered the right size the first time!!!! I instead read the reviews and and ordered one size up from what I usually buy... When I first got the dress I was so excited but sadly the zipper would not close! I immediately ordered it in a larger size and it fit like a dream!!!! I brought the smaller size in for a coworker to try on because she liked the style and snapped this cute picture of us both wearing it! Now she knows what size to buy in black and I am going to buy all the colors!!!!


So beautiful. I wore this to my bridal shower. It was an Alice in Wonderland themed tea party and everyone loved this dress. I've never had a problem with these dresses. They are always so cute. I think I have 4 so far, I'll be back for more!
