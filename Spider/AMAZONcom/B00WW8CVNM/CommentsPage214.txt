I order this dress for my mother she love it but she was hoping more a swing dress, so I ordered her a petticoat and she likes it more


Beautiful dress...looked very well made; great value...unfortunately I had to return it because it was a little too small in the bust (fit perfect everywhere else)...I didn't reorder because I was afraid it would be too big in all other areas if I did


Beautiful! Classic design! My new favorite


Ok material is ok spected better material but wearable


I LIKE IT MOST. SOO BRIGHT..


Fits as expected and the size was perfect. I love the dress.


I  love the dress , I  bought it for my girlfriend


I plan on returning it and getting a smaller size.  Based on other reviews I'd ordered a large but am swimming in it when I tried it on.  Other than that I loved the pattern, the material, and the look.


This dress was PERFECT!! Beautiful, perfect fit, and arrived early. Love it!!


Good
