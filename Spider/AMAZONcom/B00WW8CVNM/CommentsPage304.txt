Loved the dress. Fit really well. I didn't buy a size up and it fit fine.


A little cheaper quality then expected.


It fits perfectly, and is very pretty!


I just returned mine.The front part was longer than the back.


I love my dress it's just a little too long but I will get it altered.


It didn't fit me  at allğŸ˜­ and I can't return it :-( ... I lost my money:-(


Very cute, loved it


Love it !!


My dress is beautiful! I love it and I will be buying another one soon!


The dress fit perfectly and I got lots of comments on it.
