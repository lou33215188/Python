Love the print


I really like the dress. I looked at their measurements and the dress fits just right.


these dresses are made for petite women. I am somewhat tall. 5'7". None of these websites with cool dresses, fit me. Whaaaaa!!!


Super cute dress and it was a great price.


Very nice


Quality and fit exceeded my expectations.


I wear a size 16/18. The dress fit perfectly and the length falls just below my knees when worn with the with the 26" petticoat underneath. I will be ordering a few more in other colors.


It runs too small ...beautiful dress if I could fit it... order at least two sizes bigger then your normal size.  Tried to request a return they promised a New Dress still have not received new dress yet. They close out my case and haven't contacted me.  So I like the dress wish I could love it .


I love the dress. It was a little snug around the waist, but it looks good on me.


Very nice dress and great price!
