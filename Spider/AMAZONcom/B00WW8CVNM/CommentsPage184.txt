Poor quality!!!! Returned immediately.


Perfect dress for my daughter.....modest, yet stylish!!


Unfortunately the size charts were confusing as there was more than one and these dresses do not fit me.  I did return most of them but have kept one because they are soo beautiful I am using it as an encentive dress.  The company worked really well with me as far as returns and refunds so far and I am very happy with them.


Very stunning!  I'm pleased with the price and quality.


I have to say, I LOVE the dress itself. However the sizing is seriously screwed up. I read everyone's reviews. I paid attention when everyone said it ran small. I normally wear between a extra large and a 2X. So I bought a 4X. If I hold my breath and bind my boobs, I might be able to get it zipped up. I would say a 4X is the equivalent of a large in real world sizing. It's not all bad, though, I'm making it my "goal" dress


EDIT-I was reading some more reviews, and looking at people's measurements, and I'm thinking they sent the wrong size to me. There is no tag on the dress, and nothing that came with the dress mentioned sizing. I'm going to measure the dress itself and see if it matches the measurements they posted. But I do believe I got the wrong size.


EXCELLENT PRODUCT!

Felt perfect for mothers day


I bought the dress a size too big just in case. It was still too small. Returned it immediately.
