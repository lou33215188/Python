I didn't like the material.


Got compliments all night. Very comfortable.


Too small


Nice somewhat tight across shoulders chest area


Quality not what we hoped for but very pretty


yes bright cheery colours


My dress was beautiful and all but I felt it a little tight around my chest area. Nothing major but great over all and I recieved good comments. Thank you for a great job! :)  -Jessica R.


Love this dress! I got so many compliments on it I will be wearing it to work often! Perfect cut and style for work, weddings, and other special events!


It doesn't fit all that comfortably around the arms. I think I should've ordered a large instead of a Medium. Cute dress though


Wow! Not only did this dress arrive weeks earlier than expected, but also is an amazing fit and so elegant! I always rush to try on my new dresses and this dress did not disappoint. The material has some stretch to it which makes it super comfortable. If you're having doubts about this dress, don't!  I'm thrilled with my purchase.  Well, my husband's purchase for me. ❤️
