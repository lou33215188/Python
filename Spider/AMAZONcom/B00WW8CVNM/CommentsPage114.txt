It looked good when it first came in and I was willing to overlook the fact that it was 2-3 inches shorter at the seams than in the front and back. But after the first wash it shrank dramatically! So much so that my 5 year old uses it for dress up now!


DO NOT BUY unless you are not planning on washing it.


Bought this for a wedding and got a lot of compliments on it. My only complain is that the fit is a little weird around the arm holes and the neckline. Otherwise, it fit great.


LOVE THIS DRESS!  It feels great.  Just enough give.  Very pretty.


I own the purple rose and am considering buying another color. Additionally, I own the 3/4 sleeve style from this seller in gradient purple. My only issue is that the hem curls upward, but that's easily fixed with a flat iron. Overall I love these dresses!


Beautiful, comfortable and FUN!  I bought a petticoat to go with this dress, which is icing on the cake.  It's a blast!  I'm throwing myself a surprise party in June when I turn 60.  I'm asking my guests to dress like it's 1956.


Beautiful dress but WAY too small!!!


Cute dress fit ok need get size bigger its perfect  fit no room going wear to a outdoor reception with wide brim hat  nice material


Very pretty dress. Purchased a small for my tween but it was too big and cut for someone a little bustier.


I love this dress.  I wear a size 16-18 and I ordered a size 3 x.  It fit very well.  The color and fabric is as described in the ad.  I would order again.


What a lovely dress! I love this. It gives a good shape and looks a lot more expensive than it actually is! Well made quality dress. Will buy in other colors.
