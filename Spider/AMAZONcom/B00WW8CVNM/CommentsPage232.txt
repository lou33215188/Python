Fits well. Beautiful pattern


It's just like its pictured. I'm 5'1" but have a larger frame than most girls my height. Fabric has a good amount of stretch and does not feel cheap. Dress fit like a glove and with I am so exited to wear it for a girlfriend's bridal shower.


I absolutely loved the dress. I got so many complaints on it. The dress was a perfect fit and I was truly excited about that. It came right on time for the event I ordered it for as well.


Perfect


Perfect dress for a wedding. Received many compliments on it and was comfortable all day


Sizing is off. Was pretty , but snug


It's a pretty dress. It's not meant for someone with a short waist or love handles. It does not un wrinkle. I ironed it for 10 minutes and it still looked so bad.


I ordered XL will reorder in XXL great dress!!


Fits wonderfully.


Beautiful
