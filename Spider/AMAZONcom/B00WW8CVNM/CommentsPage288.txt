Cute dress, but the dress does not fall straight. It's shorter on my sides. It looks cheeply made, but the fabric is good quality.


Fits perfect I love it!!


This dress fits as expected because I ordered it too big! Go up a size and you should be okay. Love the dress! Ordered for a wedding.
