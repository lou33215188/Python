Way too long, cheap material, and runs very small. I would not recommend this.


Absolutely beautiful. It fit my 5'7" daughter whose a 34 27 32... I was afraid it would be too small for her, but it wasn't at all.. We purchased a small..


Such a cute dress i just love it.


I bought this as a gift for a good friend of mine and she absolutely loved it!


This dress is beautiful but just a little too big.  I don't think a smaller size would have been better. The cut is just a little unusual but it is easily camouflaged or fixed.  If you can't do either of these buy one size smaller.


I luved this dress.  it fits perfectly.  Would like to see more of this manufacturer's dresses.  Can I get sent a catalogue?


Beautiful!!!


A little tight on the bust but I got a lot of compliments and I love it.


Perfecto....justo beautiful, the stile is unique I love dresses and this one is perfect for me...


It was do nice, I love and will buy other colors again.
