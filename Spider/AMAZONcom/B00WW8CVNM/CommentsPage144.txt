Beautiful.. Will look great as a Derby dress. Plus other events. It is very flattering. Love the stretch fabric and print pattern.


Too small - can't return.


Love these ACEVOG vintage collections... I already bought 3 dresses with different prints :) making me greedy !!!


Really nice dress. A little longer then I hoped it would have been but I'm only 5'2.


Pleasantly surprised by how well it fit.


This dress feels wonderful on and hugged me in all the right places.


<3 it


Fit beautiful. Very classy.


I LOVE THIS DRESS! I'm 5'5 & 130. The medium is perfect. I need to order more of them!


The dress is very pretty. It does run small, I am a size 12, but I ordered a 3x. It fits great.


The dress fit perfectly. It's stretchy, which I hadn't taken notice of in the description. So it was a lovely surprise. The skirt portion of the dress hangs beautifully without adding extra size to your hips. This is a fun, yet classy summer dress. I highly recommend it.


Really really cute. Good quality fabric, and the printing is adorable.
