I bought this dress for a derby party.  I had tried it on once and loved it, but as I was putting it on the day of the event the zipper busted in half and of course I couldn't even wear the dress.  And now I can't even return it.


I really really love this dress!


Pretty


This dress is so cute. The sizes are off though.


bought for a wedding ...love the item and nicely done


Slightly snug, however, the red and black dress fit perfect....both are the same size.


I'm normally a 20-22 but the reviewsame said ran smallmouth I ordered the next size up. I lovedon't it so much I ordered the blue and white one the same day I received this one

Lovely dress, bought as a Gift. Fits her well.


Just received this dress yesterday and it has its high points and low points. High points - the color is fantastic , it fits as expected, price. Low points - Its a lot longer than I expected I am 5' 2" and it hits about mid shin on me. Also the fabric wrinkles easily.
