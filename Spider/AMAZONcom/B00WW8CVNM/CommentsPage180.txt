I absolutely love this dress.  I bought it for my daughter's birthday tea party.  The dress was a hit.


The item was too small


Dress fits perfect a cute dress but it looks better with a peticoat under!


The dress came in but is way too small at the bust line. And I couldn't get my money back. But it is wonderfully made so it's hard to give it a bad rating.


Lots of compliments on this dress! It's beautiful and exactly what I expected!


I loved the dress, but it was too small..


This was a very simple yet flattering pick. Looks great on!


Fabric is a little thin, otherwise the fit is great and everything is put together so well especially for being so inexpensive!


Order at least a size larger than you usually wear.


Good product for the price, but a little on the small side in comparison to similar style dresses in the same size.
