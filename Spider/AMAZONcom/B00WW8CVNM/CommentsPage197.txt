I would give it a 5-star if it doesn't get wrinkly after washing.


I LOVE this dress...but... I am almost 6' and the waist, sadly, is about two inches too high.  I don't care...I will wear it anyway!


So many compliments


Super cute and flattering dress. I bought it for my daughters 16th birthday and she loved it. Nice quality material, but also light wearing. I'm very happy with this dress


This dress is so much better than expected.  The value for money is amazing.  I haven't washed it yet, so not quite sure what to expect as there are no washing instructions on the dress.  Hoping it will wash well as it looks great on.


great fit and quality. excited to wear


LOVE IT!!!!! fits perfect.


Dress is comfortable, easy to clean but does not iron well.


Not great material


Pretty dress for Church, flowy and cool. Flattering for a fuller/ curvier figure.
