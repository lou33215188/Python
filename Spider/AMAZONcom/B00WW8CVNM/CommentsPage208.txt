Beautiful dress!


Let me start off by saying that the day I got the dress, I had to return it. I ordered this dress in X-Large in the blue/floral color. The dress arrived in great timing, but as soon as I pulled the dress out of the bag, I could see (sadly enough) that it would be way too small. I used the measurements in the description, and the dress should have fit, but I could tell just holding it up that the bust area wouldn't be big enough, and it wasn't. Be careful if you are bustier or have a larger back/shoulders. Even if the description says that it should fit, order up one size. Also, the zipper is pretty cheap, which is a bummer. :( I may reorder a larger size once they get the return and I am refunded, because the dress itself did look pretty, or I may look somewhere else for a different dress...


This is absolutely a classic by definition, colors bold, fabric is nice, tayloring very good.  Unfortunately the sizing is very small.  In fact I would suggest ordering 2 sizes up.


got a different color and size than shown in the picture


It arrived  little early, I like the dress. It's exactly as pictured


Bought this dress for a wedding and it fit perfectly when I tried it on.  I can't wait to wear it - it is fantastic!
