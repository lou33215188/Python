I absolutely love this dress! This was my first time to ever buy clothes on Amazon, and I'm very pleased. It fits perfectly! I received many compliments on this dress. I plan on buying the same dress in other colors.


Love how the dress fits.  I toke advice of the other customers and ordered 2 sizes up and fit beautifully!


Very pretty! Love the 1950's style!


SO pretty! Love it love love it! I get LOTS of compliments every time I wear it!


fit well


Loved the dresses but they were way too small!


This dress was poorly made with threads coming off in random spots but for the money I didnt expect much! If you have sewing skills then you should be able to fix it and make it look nice! If not I would suggest to look elsewhere!


Beautiful!


I read the reviews before ordering and others recommended to order 2 sizes up.  I wear a 20-22 normally so I ordered the 4x instead of my normal 2x.  It fits perfectly!  This dress is adorable! The material is like a polished cotton, light and airy yet not see through. I'm giving 4 stars rather than 5 just due to the fact that the neckline is a little weird, but not enough to keep me from wearing it or sending it back.  It is a about an inch too big, therefore it doesn't lay quite flat...if that makes sense. I may add a picture later to show what I mean if anyone asks. But for the price I paid, I am extremely satisfied. Also, I got this dress in the mail, carefully packaged, about 4 days after ordering.
