very rough fabric, felt almost like curtain material, and kind of looked like it too


Love it ❤️


Beautiful dress- I love it fits as described.  Highly recommend this seller.


Firs better than expected, I'm tall so the length was perfect. Thanks


Don't get me wrong, the style and color were perfect.  I just could not get into it.  The sizing I saw before ordering the dress were completely wrong. By looking at the measurement listed, I thought that the dress maybe a little to large ( according to the measurement chart, boy I was completely wrong!  I could barely put the top part of my body into the dress, let alone the rest. I thought about sending it back but it was too pretty for the price.  I decided to give it to my sister who is much smaller than me.


Didn't look good on me.........zipper opening so small it was very hard to get into and out of.


Adorable and great quality.


It fit as expected.  Love the dress.


Good product.


Loved the dress, but it was a bit small on top. I returned for a bigger size and can't wait to receive!!
