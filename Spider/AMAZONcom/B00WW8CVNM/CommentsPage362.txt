LOVE THIS DRESS!!!!!!!!


I just got it and i am already in love with it.


Really classy look.  I did not expect it to go that far below my knees so it was a delightful surprise.  I am 5'11 so I was expecting this dress to stop somewhere between 2-3 inches above my knees.


Also the fabic is really soft:) feels great. I may order another.


This was not at all what I expected. I felt awful in it.
