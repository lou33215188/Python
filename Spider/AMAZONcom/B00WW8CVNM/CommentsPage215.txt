Really tight and unwearable.


I just love it fits perfectly I brought a petticoat to put under it and now I love it even more thanks


Love this dress. Well-made. Bought another in different color.


Size chart not right. Too small. Should be adjusted.  Did ask for a return dress because I like it so much. I was given a retune on my purchase. I would have rather had the dress in the correct size.


Amazing. My daughter felt like a princess.


good


Tight around the arm and breast area but made of a stretchy material. A very pretty dress.


I love this dress just wish it was a little easier to zip up zipper gets a little stuck sometimes but i love the style great for the price!!


Very cute and fits great.


Runs SUPER small.
