The dress is fine. But the sizing is way off. I've ordered a lot of clothes on Amazon from Asian companies, and I can always look at the reviews to figure out which size  to get, and it always fits. Thank you, everyone who wrote your weight, height, and size you ordered and then explained well if it fit you or not. This dress, however, was way too small, even when I went by other people's experience, and what you receive is a different brand than what is said in the listing.


it's a little bit small  but i'm keep it


You won't get what you bought


Adorable dress, well made, exactly what I was looking for.


Love this dress.  I get tons of compliments every time I wear it.


Looks beautiful; but runs small.  I should have ordered a size larger.
