This dress was a beautiful fit!! I had to order a 3X but I knew I would have to, since it was coming from China. It zipped up perfect and it has a little stretch to it. I'm a size 18W and I normally wear a XL so please take that into consideration.


Beautiful dress but not flattering to women with curves


Very feminine and flattering


Love the dress but must be true to size I thought it would run a little smaller still was beautiful. Got compliments and I felt cute and comfortableğŸ˜�
