Fits perfect and the vibrant floral print is beautiful. I wore the dress to a bridal shower and it was a hit ... I LOVE MY VINTAGE DRESS !!


Love this dress... is just too perfect.


Im a L order it XL


Wonderful fabric!


This dress is beautiful fits as expected and the color is exactly as seen in picture! I would definitely purchase again and also highly recommend!!


I had to return this because it was too small in the chest area, but the material was nice and definitely worth the money.


Love the color, fit and quality of this dress! Perfect for a summer party!


Good quality however the sizing is way off. It it far to small even as a large.


This dress is everything if you are into Vintage type clothing. It fits amazing, is super flattering, and perfect for both work and fun. I will definitely be buying more in other patterns. The beige one I bought is incredibly beautiful.


Would not zip. Ordered 2 sizes bigger and did not fit
