way to long, n fit tight around the arms


It's so cute! Exactly what I wanted!


Nice cloth & elegant but did not fit me so am returning it.


Liked it but I thought that it was just a little too long.


Dress fit as expected and looked great, however the zipper broke at the first wearing. Very disappointing


Great dress especially for the price!! Exactly what I expected. Because of the shape its an easy fit, worn it and washed it twice, and still love it!


Wore this dress to a wedding, beautiful dress. Very comfortable and colourful can dress it up or down.


It's a really cute dress and fit perfectly. The material is good quality.


I got this dress for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it and it looks damn good.


It was a tiny bit big at the neck line, but overall it was a good fit and I love it!
