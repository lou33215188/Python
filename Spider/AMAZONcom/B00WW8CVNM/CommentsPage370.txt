First time to wear this gorgeous floral dress when I attended our church's anniversary the other day and my brothers and sisters in spirit said that it made me look good and attractive.


I love this dress, i wasnt impressed when i first layed eyes on it till i wore it. Its realy flattering


Not appropriate for a large woman. It just made me look larger.


Cheap fabric , looks terrible . Extremely disapointed


Nice


Super pretty dress.  Zipper back, runs small


If the size chart was accurate this would be 5 star.  Make sure to order the next size up.  If you are built long waisted, this isn't the dress for you.  It is however a beautiful dress and appears to be well crafted.


Preparing for an event and thanks that I found a dress like this. Simple looking but has an elegant look when partnered with diamond jewelries.


Dear customers,


Don't buy this dress - it wasn't like as seen the photo. I ordered it and after 17 days finally received. It had an unpleasant odor,  zipper didn't work and color wasn't correct color that I ordered. Then I wanted to return the dress - they said that they are sending it from China it will be very expensive to return the dress .....too complicated.  Just don't order these nasty dresses - don't waste your money and time!


Perfect dress for spring,Thank you
