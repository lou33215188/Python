I wasn't impressed with the dress in the picture it looked like better quality but it wasn't. It was very poor made for price I paid.


Beautiful dress. Style and fit were spot on.


Perfect fit & absolutely classy, elegant and gorgeous


Beautiful dress fits like it says.


I really wanted to keep this dress. I got a 4XL thinking I got a 4X. Big difference. The 4XL is for a smaller plus size. Hopefully they will come in my size.


Such a cute dress. I wore it to work and everyone said I looked like a 50s housewife, which was indeed the look I was going for, so perfect!


its perfect


bought the large...only wear size 10...but doesnt zip up in the back...


good


I LOVE this dress! It was better than expected and looks amazing with a petticoat under.
