So pretty couldn't wait to get it run very small returned it what a disappointment


it fit great I'm a size 4 in USA sizes and it was perfect! the only thing was the armpit was like really high so I feel like that fabric will wear out a bit faster because of deodorant. hope this helps! otherwise very pleasant sun dress!


Haven't been able to wear it because the cut is smaller than expected.


Poorly made. Not true to size. Seller would not take a return because it was "too difficult". Not happy will not recommend this seller.


Beautiful.  Classy.


Too small.  Measured to be accurate knowing they run small from the reviews.  Order up one size and still to small in bust area.


Fabulous dress! So feminine! Fits beautifully, gorgeous drape, lovely material. I am thrilled, especially given the incredibly low price!


I love this dress. It fits well and looks amazing. I wore it to my sister in law's wedding. I received numerous compliments about how I looked and the dress.  I'm trying to find reasons to wear it again asap. I also bought a petticoat to wear under it, looked perfect!


AMAZING DRESS! So many compliments you would not believe! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress! Everything I wanted and more!


I have been walking advertisement for your dresses. I wear them to every show and get compliments from both male and female.. I tell them the sizes are accurate and its amazon what more could they want. I am very happy with the price and the product.
