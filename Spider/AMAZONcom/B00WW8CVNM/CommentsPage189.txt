It makes me look so beautiful.


Everything about this dress is wonderful EXCEPT the sizing :-( Im an XL in every dress I own.... this dress didnt fit over my BUST :-(  SAD and disapointed I have to print out the return form


As long as you take measurements of yourself before ordering, you'll get the right size. Dress is very pretty and flattering, but the darn zipper snags really easy! Overall, I would definitely buy this dress again, and I actually might in a different color if it holds up well in the upcoming weeks.


Really pretty


Looked awesome, fit great! Just a tad stiff. But by the end of the evening it was great!!!
