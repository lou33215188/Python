I love this! Good quality, fits perfect and Classic


It's beautiful and looks great on me, it just fits small on top.  Can't wear it yet because the zipper broke when zipping up. It runs small on top.


Fit beautifully, but was too tight around the armpits.  I had to return!  Getting it a size larger wasn't an option either because then it would have been too big everywhere else.  Disappointed!


This dress fit better than the other one I purchased from another vendor. After reading the reviews, I did order a size larger which was the right move. Great color.


well made nice cut material great


My daughter loves the dress.


Love love LOVE this dress!!! It fit exactly as it said. Got a ton of compliments on it too!


Have not worn it yet, but I love it and can;t wait to wear it.


I bought the black&flowers one, size M. It fits perfectly. Btw, I am 5.7 and 140lbs. It's a bit long but good with high heels.
