Came on time, fit perfect, but the only problem is it was unbelievably wrinkled and veRyan hard to iron


love this dress fitted as expected.


Love the fit, love the color and love the style. Quick shipment I recommend!


Pretty dress!


Bought for ballroom dancing, but wearing outside the ballroom -  I received a lot of compliments on the dress


The print is beautiful, but I expected the length to longer based on the picture and description.  I ordered 5 of the dresses and I decided to let my daughter have them. The size made no sense, a large was the same as a 3x.


I love this dress and received so many compliments.  I added a crinoline slip and it really made a statement.


A little longer than I was expecting but very cute nonetheless


odered two same size same company  one smalland thiner material the other slightly larger


This dress was PERFECT. I wore a red petticoat underneath and it was gorgeous. It fit just right for me, I loved everything about it.
