Perfect fit. I'm 5'Â³ and about 115 lbs, just know that if your small in the bust area, your going to want a more padded bra. Got tons of compliments.


It fits perfect. Looks awesome. Elegant! I recommend it 100%. Would like to buy all colors


The only thing ai didn't like was the way the top of the dress scoops open when I look down or bend down.


Love it!


Way too small. Must be meant for stick figures.


Very cute and stylish. Ordered it for Easter. It's a little big but it works.


I ordered a size UP from what I thought was correct just in case. Fabric is ok and the pattern is really cute and exactly what I wanted but was really disappointed in the size.


Beautiful dress, well made, good quality material. I was, very, pleased with this dress and how it fits.


This dress is sexy & classy at the same time. I purchased a size small due to weighing 118 lbs and being 5'6 and it fits perfectly.


The fit was very good. The material is okay, kinda stiff. The color was much lighter than the picture.
