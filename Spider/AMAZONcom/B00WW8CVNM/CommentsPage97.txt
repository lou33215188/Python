This is an excellend dress, very well made and high quelity fabric. I'm very happy with it. The only detail is that one of the waist stichings was lose, so there was a 2inch hole on the dress. No problem, though, I stiched the fabric toghether and it is as good as new.


Love this!!!!!!! Its beautiful. No liner, however do not dry!!!! I shrunk mine and im soooo mad!


Wore this to a wedding and got tons of compliments. I will definitely keep wearing it for years to come! Great quality and very flattering on my curvy body type.


I LOVE this dress! I can't find anything wrong with it...I haven't tried it with the slip but i just adore it.


Loved the dress itself. Very pretty and feminine. Very disappointed it didn't fit, not even remotely close to fitting. Had to return it.


Mine's not as bright and e catching as the picture but, I do like it. Just wish it wasn't so dull.


Great dress, seems well made.  Bought according to my bust size but there was some gapping under the arms.  I just ran a seam to help close it.


Beautiful dress but was very disappointed with the sizing. Order 3 or 4 sizes larger for dress to fit. The spring is beautiful. Had to return the dress.


Wow, I love this dress!  It's perfect for our more casual office setting, and very comfortable.  Well made and so cute!  Had lots of compliments!


It's my favorite dress. Cool and lightweight and has also allowed for a little weight fluctuation because of the sash.
