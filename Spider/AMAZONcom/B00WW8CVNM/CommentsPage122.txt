I love love love this dress! for the price I paid for such good quality and fit as expected for a size XL, as I'm normally between size 14-16.


This pattern really caught my eye and I received a number of compliments the first day I wore it.  Just know that the material is on the thin side and clung to a spanx type undergarment.  Unfortunately I had given away all my slips a while ago since I didn't use them and now I wished I'd hung on to one.  It needs a slip.  Also needs to be ironed - which is something I haven't done in a long while either.


A spendid dress, a sure eyecatcher!


Beautiful dress. Very well made.  Fits true to size (I ordered XL).  The skirt has a lot of swing. The color I ordered was blue - true navy blue color.


gave it away


Much higher quality than expected for the price!


It was a little smaller then  expected but it's beautiful and very  vibrant colors


The dress is not lined and it is very see through.  You would have to wear a fitted slip with it.


Didn't fit well and had to return it but it is a beautiful dress.


This is BEAUTIFUL dress.


Love the fit, the quality of fabric is more than I expected.
