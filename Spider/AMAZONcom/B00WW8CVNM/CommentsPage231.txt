Fits great love this dress the dress is same as picture


Perfect in every way!


To small not true to size


No room for a real bustline.. If you buy a 2XL assume they are going to have a bust.  Other than that they were adorable.


Wife loved the fit and she looked great in it


Loved it at first but has not worn well. Loved it the first time I wore it but it does not wear well after a few washes.


I have actually purchased this dress in two different prints and have the plans to purchase a few more! Fits perfect and I get a ton of complements every time I wear it!


Fit is as expected. Quality is great for a dress at this price point. Material is light enough for summer.


Cheaply made


This fit Perfectly! Very flattering,  good quality material,  I will be buying another one in a different color!
