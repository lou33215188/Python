I'm in LOVE with this dress.


Beautiful, especially with a petticoat. A bit high waisted.  Love it!


Love it!


This dress fit nicely, but I was disappointed because the hem was uneven. The back left  was about an inch short, creating an odd diagonal hem just on that side. I do have some sewing skills, so I will fix it myself. I am 5'6" 110# and the small was a good fit for me.


Adorable!


This is a really cute dress. I found it hard to zip until I figured out that there was no need to mess with the zipper, just put it on like that. :D


The quality of the fabric is better than I expected for the price. The print is also really vibrant. It's a lovely dress, I'm very happy with it.


Good quality


Fabric is good but very light and should be lined to upgrade it. Runs two sizes small


I actually really like the dress. Fancy without being over done. Flattering cut and skirt length.  Very happy with my purchase.
