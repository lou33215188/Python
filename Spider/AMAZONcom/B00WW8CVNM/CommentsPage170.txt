The dress I received was NOT dress I ordered or correct size. I was planning on wearing to my son's wedding, but obviously could not since it was not what I ordered!!! Very unhappy! Very dissatisfied!


Very pretty but way too small through the bust and waist. I wear a size 16 and ordered this in a 3x thinking if would be roomy but it barely fit. Very disappointed.


Looks cute and fits as expected.  If you have a pear shape then its a good buy.


It was a little too small on my bust but other than that its great quality. And comfortable.


The dress fits great and looks gorgeous . I can't wait to wear it on Mothers' day


I ordered this dress to wear to a rockabilly wedding in February. I was worried about the size and how it would fit since I'm 4 months pregnant. After reading the reviews I decided to get a 3x I normally wear a large or x-large. The 3x fit just right. Not too tight. It has some stretch room. The fit is beautiful. Can't wait to wear it out.
