I am so WONDERFULLY impressed by this dress! I was careful not to set my hopes too high but honest to goodness, this dress exceeded my expectations!


Based on others' reviews, I sized up and ordered the XXL. For reference, I weigh 195lb, wear a 38DD bra, and typically wear a size 14-16 dress. This dress is slightly too big/baggy in the neck/upper chest and I have a little wiggle room in the waist, but I don't feel like I need to return it (especially before washing). The fabric does have the tiniest stretch to it which helps, and it does include an attached tie-back at the waist. I'm going to buy another dress in a different pattern sized down to compare, but if you're even halfway considering this... DO IT!!


This is so beautiful. I got so so many compliments, I am shopping for another Acevog dress right now. It is fitted, and flares out. So MANY COMPLIMENTS!!


the dress is beautiful and fits perfect!!


Beautiful dress! I love it!
