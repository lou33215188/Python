loved it online, but the skirt is surprisingly short.


The dress fit perfect and my wife looks beautiful in it!


Very nice dress but not as short as I expected


it is very big;  I am on size 2 .  This is way to big


I love the material


Way too small. I could not even get into it.


I like it very much. It's worth the price.


I received alot of complements on this dress. I bought the slip to show a more vintage look.


Fabric was lovely.  Bust was small.


Too small in the bust but otherwise great
