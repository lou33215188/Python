It was a gift. She loved it


It fits a little small and the material reminds me of opening curtains. But since I will not wear it often, it will do.


Great and pretty!


This dress is absolutely perfect! Fits me perfectly and I got SO MANY compliments at our Easter brunch!


Nice dress definitely will buy more


Perfect


Very Satisfied


Absolutely gorgeous, thank you very much I will be ordering more of these dresses.  The colors are spectacular, true to picture


Thankful Customer!


Excellent for the value.  I wore for a summer outdoor wedding and it was perfect.  I combined with a petticoat also purchased on the Amazon. I wear a 12 and have broad shoulders bra size 38c and purchased an XL.


I like the quality of the material but it does not fit as it looks like in the picture. I will have to return it even though I ordered two sizes bigger it is still very small.


Very cheap zipper. Easily go off track and broke after first use.
