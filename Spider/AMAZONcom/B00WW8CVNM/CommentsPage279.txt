It is one of this items that looks better on the photo then in real life.


Great fabric! Beautiful cut. Love it!!


This is a pretty and flattering dress. It is made of light cotton material. It was a little snug across the chest and a little longer (below the knees) than anticipated, but fit nicely!


I loved the way it looked but I was very sad it didn't fit across my shoulders.


Beautiful indeed


The dress is beautiful but it is extremely small. I ordered 2 sizes larger than normal and it is staying way too small.


Nice lines. Fit a little snug but was expecting that.  Will definitely be buying more .


The print is very pretty. It was way too large.


Super happy with this dress! I love the strwtxhu material. It is so comfey. Perfect height on the bust line and long enough to wait a peti coat if I want to. I love it so much I just ordered another one in a different color.


Used to Lane a Bryant 3x. Too small
