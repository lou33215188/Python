This dress is really long. If you're short, it'll probably come down to your shins!


I love love LOVE this dress!!!! It fits perfectly and is gorgeous!!!


Perfect dress for an evening out!


I tried to go by the sizing indicated, but the waist was still too small.  I do plan to lose some wait before the Summer, so it will give me incentive.


This dress is beautiful and fits great. I am definitely going to order more!


There sizes are to small


order larger size. Otherwise a beautiful dress


Even I look good in it.  Great quality, too.


I Love the dress, but the sizes are off, by a lot.


I watched the size chart knowing the sizes are very small so had good results on size and its very comfortable.  I like the colors
