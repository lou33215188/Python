I have purchased several of these dresses from Acevog, and have had varied luck.  The three I currently own are the purple flowered, blue with white polka dots and the black with red flowers.  I also purchased it in the red (which was the same tagged size but was about 3 sizes smaller) and just got the light green floral - which fits as expected in the body but is about 4 inches shorter than the description (dress measures 36 inches, web site description said 40 inches).  The length on all the others is tea length on me, I am 5' 8.5", it falls about 2 inches below my knee.  I ordered size XL, I usually take a 12 in dresses and they're just a little roomy.  I would guess the XL is close to a 14 in US sizing.  It seems to be a cotton blend so I am hoping it will shrink a bit in the dryer. The fabric is light but not cheap feeling, was wrinkled upon delivery but easily ironed.  Plenty of fabric in the skirt, if you'd like it to 'poof' out you'll need a crinoline underneath.  Great price, nice dresses except for the inconsistencies on sizing.  It would be much, much better if the manufacturer would get some more consistency.


Love the material. Soft and has a little bitbof stretch to it. Fits as expected and delivered in a timely manner.  Recommend this dress, company and style.


Beautiful, slightly stretchy, quality fabric. Will buy another.


Loved the dress but too tight in bust line. I'm a 36 DD.


Beautiful dress for a wedding reception.


Too small. A girl can dream.


Just. Too. Small.  ğŸ˜ 


Beautiful. Should have ordered normal size.


Way too small and shoddy workmanship. The hem wasn't even sewn in places. Returning ğŸ˜¥


thicker, stretchy fabric that is comfortable and looks wonderful.  Already wore it and washed it in cold and it came out as good as new.
