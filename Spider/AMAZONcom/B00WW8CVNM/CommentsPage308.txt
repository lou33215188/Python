Its ok i like it , just a little snug for me maybe just because im top heavy but i do like the dress


I returned it.


This dress is just as pictured. I love it.


It was a little to small and it was to long


I should have gotten a different color, but this is fine. Thanks for asking.


It's a beautiful print....a little snug for the size and they forgot to finish sewing a seam together....I'm going to try


It is too small around the breast area, and too large at the neck. I will alter it to fit correctly.


Great material just fits small


I'd get at least one size up. Really happy with purchase


The product is pretty. Material is nice. But the size that was ordered was XL. What arrived was marked as XL but really fit a girl size 8. Do not buy this product.... the sizing is completely wrong. And the vendor does not accept returns. He offers a 20% rebate instead of returning it and they suggest that I "find someone else that will fit into it".
