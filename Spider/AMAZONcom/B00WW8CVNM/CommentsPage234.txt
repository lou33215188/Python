The dress was fine for the money. It was very cheaply made, but it was fine. I enjoyed wearing it.


Beautiful and fits perfect

A bit too long.

25bucks dress,,?? its sooo worth it!!!


Great dress love love love it. It was just a little tight across the chest area. Going up a size didn't help across the chest area for me but using a minimizer bra helped. Great buy


Super small for the size I ordered Just like the reviews said. So Order a size WAY larger than you need and its great.
