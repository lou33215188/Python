It's thinner than I expected but it is real cute.  It's not as flare as I would like it but it a keeper.  I like it a lot.


Bust area is way toooo small. And im only a c cup.


great quality. good measures. looks great. exactly what is shown on picturs.


Awful, the zipper got messed up.


It's too bad.  It's a pretty dress, but the fit, especially in the bust area, did not match the measurements listed.


Loved it so much I bought 3 more in different colors. Fits great and super flattering!


Nice spring/summer dress. A good fit


I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DRESS. I WOKE UP TO IT AND IT MADE MY DAY. ITOTALLY RECCOMEND IT! I got the apricot floral pattern and I love it '


The dress is great, but the zipper is very small, full of threads and does not support the overall quality of the dress. Would have given 5 stars if the zipper was of better quality and strength.


This dress is awesome! I wore to a derby party and received so many compliments. I'm a size 4, 119 pounds and 5'4. ordered a small and It fits perfect! Very pleased! So pretty and elegant!
