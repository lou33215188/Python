I ordered too small but was impressed with quality, so I ordered another one in correct side. Will buy from seller again


It fit everywhere but the bustline, which was way too small. The material and workmanship were both good quality. If you do order this style, make sure you get the suggested petticoat also. It makes a big difference.


longer and not as full as what is pictured.


I wear it on my friend birthday dinner coz my husband like it me also it's fit really good on me.


Lovely dress. a bit tight around bust.


I am 5'6, weigh 134 pounds and measure 37/28/38. I ordered a medium with the red and black floral print and aside from being a little tight in the bust (not obscenely so), it fits very well. All in all it's a very nice dress, especially considering the price.


Runs small in size. but a pretty dress. My husband love it!


Well made dress, fit as expected. I'm 5'1 and about 130 pounds with a curvy shape. I bought a large. The dress comes to about my ankles, but that's what I expected. It's super flattering and comfortable.


I ordered a size larger than my normal size fits great love it .


I wear a size 10/12 and bought the large. It is fitted but definitely on the small side especially in the bust area. Nicely made for the price. The description says blue but it is definitely black.
