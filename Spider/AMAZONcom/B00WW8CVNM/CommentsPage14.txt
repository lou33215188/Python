It fits just as promised and the lines of the dress are extremeley flattering to most body shapes. Warpping a thick belt around the wait with emphasize an hourglass appearance. It also looks great with a little black or blue shrug or cardigan over it. Whenever I wear this dress I get lots of compliments. I will be ordering similar dresses like this from this vendor in the future! It is machine washable, but do it on the gentle cycle, dry on permanent press or medium heat and if you need to iron it do it on a lower setting.


I love this dress. I wore this to church one Sunday and received so many compliments!


This dress is absolutely beautiful (I ordered the black and white with red flowers)!!!! If your wondering abut the fit I am 5'6, 125, 34B and small fit me absolutely perfect (I am normally a Small/Medium or 2/4) and I think the sizing is pretty right on. The only down fall to this dress is the ribbon that goes around the waist and ties at the back is WAY too short!! It wraps around and it can be tied but it is a very tiny bow at the back, its not pretty long flowing ribbon (kind looks like a ball of material when your done). Other than that (yeah its kinda a big deal) I love this dress.

Very cute inexpensive dress. I am 5'3, 185-190 pounds and wear a 38B and the xxl dress fit perfectly. Will need to wear a slip or petticoat as it may be see through in certain lighting. Just ordered another in a different print!


Update:  I loved the green dress with flowers so much I decided to buy the black with purple flowers dress in the same size. I was disappointed to find that the dress pattern was different between the two. The black with purple flowers fit but was just a tad snug in the chest which is where the difference is in the patterns. Just be aware when buying the fit maybe different even if you buy the same size. And as you can see from the photo the black and purple is definitely smaller.


Niiice ğŸ‘� I'm 5'9 ,140lb.


This is a great vintage-looking dress! I am definitely in love with it and it's perfect for the event I'm going to. Make sure to read the sizing chart carefully. I ordered an XL and am usually a true American size 6 in dresses. It fits perfectly and is modest, but classy and feminine. It works well with a petticoat underneath, as pictured below. I hope this helps!


Glad this dress looks so cute on so many! I'm very disappointed though. I followed the sizing chart to a T aaaannnnddd nope! Not even close!! It was too small in the bust, wouldn't even zip! And too small in the arms. I requested a refund and got a lame "it's too hard to take this back, take $3 and give it to a friend. They'll love it!" note from the seller. What a load of s***. I can't use the product. I can't return the product. And now.. I get to go "Hey, I bought this for me but it doesn't fit so you can have it." Lame. Really unhappy with this one.


I was soooo hesitant about buying this dress but I'm so glad hat I did. I am 5'4 and I weigh 240lbs. I am big chested- size 40G. I usually wear about a 20W- 22W or 2-3X depending on how it is made. So I definitely looked at the size chart. My measurements are 49-47.5-50. So I ordered the 3X plus and it fit just right. The dress stopped just below my kneecap, which is fine for me. I don't have a petticoat so I will be wearing it as it came.the dress is lovely. The colors are vivid and I will be buying more! I will post pictures later. I bought it for a special occasion.


I bought the red roses with black..Beautiful Dress. I bought this for this coming Easter and can't wait to wear it. I kept reading reviews that it runs small. So I ordered 3 x....the dress leaves me plenty of room in the muffin top area as well as the waist. I stand at 5'6 about 190 pounds..most of my weight is in my 44. DDD breast area. Turns out it fits just right perfect above..but some stretch around my 37 waist. I wondered if I was  correct in sizing or should I have sized down 1 size. As I seen this dress on other pages with different size charts. And different stores..but the same dress. Honestly, I was slightly concerned with the inconsistencies in charts. This store I trusted the most cuz it identified better details up close. So it took me a while to decide to go ahead with a 3 x instead of 2x. I figure it'll be better fitting slightly big than too small. I ordered a petticoat and it set the tone and complimented the dress with a blk basic cartigan. Im thinking about ordering the purple next and the blue later on or maybe next year..Overall I feel very confident and can't wait to show it off Easter Sunday :)


I ordered the light blue color with floral pattern.  The color is a pretty light robin-egg-blue, and the print is vibrant in color and has a retro feel to it.  I like this dress, and the fabric is nice for the price.  I ordered an XL based on the acevog size chart.  My measurements were right on the upper edge of the measurements listed for the Large, so I ordered the XL as some reviews claimed that this dress runs small.  The XL fits ok and can be tightened with the belt straps, but the large would have been better.  I am 5'4" 150 lbs. normally wear a 12 or 14 in jeans and a 38 D bra.  The fabric does have a bit of stretch to it and has a nice weight.  While this is a cute dress with a full A-line skirt, it is not a full circle skirt for those who have very full petticoats you want to accomodate.
