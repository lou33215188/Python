I wore this dress and it fits great. Highly recommend


This was so small it I returned it


This vintage dress was SUPER adorable :-) I wore it to a wedding and received numerous compliments. The only part of the dress that was a bit small was the underarm area. It kind of squeezed tight up against my skin. Who knows? Maybe my arms are too fat!


Very cute dress a little longer than what I was expecting but I don't mind like it a little longer I am only 5'3 so it's fine. Ships from China came sooner than I was expecting so that's great.


i love this outfit


I am handicapped, and I wear leg emobalizers. From thigh to calf. I like to feel pretty too, but I would like for it to be a little bit longer. & NO TIE.


**I T FEELS PRETTY ! ! ! !


It's longer than I expected. I have to have it taken up by about a foot because it looked like a bridesmaids dress.


Very pretty and accurate sizing.


Great dress


Cheap material I just bumped it  my charitable donation bag hopefully I can get someone to use it.
