It was to small so gave it to my daughter. Dress is very pretty though.


Ok


Very nice - got tons of complements on it. Thank you.


Size Small runs very big.


This dress is beautiful... it fits a little bit snug across the chest. But I still love it


The burst line was too tight


Sizing runs small.


I ordered my correct size and could not get the zipper up.


Loved it. Fit perfect like it was made just for me!


I love the dress. It fits and it looks better on.
