I am a size 8 and the large was too small.


The fabric is very thin, cheaply made, only one layer.


Not impressed :(


Absolutely gorgeous! Feels like high quality material with solid stitching. Runs a little small, as I am between a12 and 14 in all other clothes, but this size L won't zip at all.


This dress gives me the perfect vibe of the 50s. Fun and flirty yet sophisticated.


I really liked the cut off the dress however it does run almost two sizes too small. I typically wear an 18/1x so I ordered a 2x. While the 2x fit in the skirt area it was uncomfortably tight in the chest.


The dress is beautiful. The one thing I don't like about it is the zipper, it's plastic and I would prefer a metal one. I  love the dress thouhk


Beautiful, elegant, well made, perfect for any occasion.  A keeper.


Delivery was Expediant & timely, ordering a size up as the reviewers suggested as I am an Inbetween size. Fits beautifully.


Very flattering dress.  Received a lot of compliments.  I just love it.


It arrived with holes in the sides.


I love this dress | It is so comfortable  and the length is perfect just below the knee
