Shipment took a while since it's coming from China, but I like the packaging it came in. It will probably need to be steamed to get the wrinkles out but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the the material and the print. The print is beautiful and love the color.


The colour was slightly different than expected (a much lighter shade than the dark blue shown) but it fit nicely.


she loved it she's happy i am haooy


Definitely not high quality, but the fit was decent

I love this dress


Love this dress!! Never order clothes online, but this had great reviews and only $25 so glad i did. I'm 5'5", 120lbs, ordered a small and it fits perfect! Hits just below the knee, color and pattern true to online pic. Material feels good quality; has just a bit stretch to it, which is nice. Looks super cute with heels. Ordered another dress in black today!


Its a cute dress and you can't really beat the price. It does run small at the top, which isn't usually my problem area. But its cute. I will prob. order another to have it altered. I love how the bottom flows.


Their XL is a 14 not an extra large.  My fault for not checking their sizing chart before


I ordered.  The dress was lovely.


Gorgeous dress but like 3 sizes to small, gave it to my best friend...she was thrilled
