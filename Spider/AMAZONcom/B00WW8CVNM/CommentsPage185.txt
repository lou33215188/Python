My wife liked it and its good fit


I purchased it for my daughter but didn't fit around the upper body.


Fits just as I hoped it would.  Glad I trusted my gut and went a size larger.


LOVE THIS DRESS!!!!!


good quality.... better than I thought it would be.  material is thick enough that in the hot summer I don't have to wear a clingy slip.


I loved the dress, but the size was just a little too small for my built (I have a wider back and shoulders than most women) But, did love the dress!


I ended up returning this, I didn't need it for the wedding.


Beautiful.


Wasn't sure how it would fit but it fit great with my curves. Love this dress


I love the dress but it the medium fit a little tight.  I should have ordered a large.
