Returned dress...runs small. No give in the material.  Neckline a bit high for me.  Felt like I was being choked.


Wife looks amazing in this :)


Beautiful dress love how it fits.


Cute dress!  Fits good.


Fit except for the chest area. Way too small


The dress is pretty ..I like it's snug on top showing my waist and I'm 5'2 the dress comes down to my shin ..the dress came with 2 white lines down front :( I guess you get what you pay for..I bought it for a part of my Halloween  costume hoping I could wear it again..maybe I can get it hemmed up cutting off the white strips


I get so many compliments on this dress! It's stetchy and so comfy I wear it everywhere!


I ordered a 3X. My room mate, who normally wears a large could barely fit in it.  I won't be going with this brand again.


Nice!


The dress doesn't have quite as much "give" as other reviews led me to believe. The material is very thin, you get what you pay for, but completely acceptable for a nice inexpensive dress.
