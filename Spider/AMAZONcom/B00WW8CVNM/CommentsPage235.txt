Super cute dress! Wore this for church and thought it was appropriate but trendy enough. Only issue was the zipper gets stuck. The wrinkles iron out easily to .


The dress has a tie in the back...the picture doesn't show that. I adore the dress but not crazy about the tie.


Ahhhhh! Finally It's has arrived. Thank you seller for your extreme  patients , even when I was at my most frustrated.The wait was worth it the dress fits fabulous! Thanks! ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜€


One of my favorite dresses


Poor stitching quality.


fits nice, length is just below the knees, nice color.  it was just like it's pictured.


Looks cheap


Beautiful and fine quality !


It will do but it's a tad bit tightğŸ˜”


I like it fine, but it doesn't fit. Trying to find someone who can wear it, or I have to send back.
