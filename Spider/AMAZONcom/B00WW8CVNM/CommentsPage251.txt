Good quality material with some stretch to it.  Fit well according to the measurement chart listed by the manufacturer.  It is a beautiful dress and look gorgeous with a petticoat.


Well worth the money. Very happy with this dress. It fits perfectly, and have had many compliments. If you are a woman with a curvy figure, this dress is perfect!


Love this dress. Nicely made!


I'm 5'8" and 128 lbs... the medium fits nearly tailor made.  Bought a petticoat to wear with (for a 50s theme event), but it is just as cute without it.


Little bit  large,  but served  the purpose


Was just slightly thinner material than I thought.


Love it!  Bought a size bigger than I usually would, glad I did.


It's perfect I love it and will be buying more


Really happy with material I've had a hard time finding the right choice for my body but this flower pattern looked fine


Pretty dress. Small on top
