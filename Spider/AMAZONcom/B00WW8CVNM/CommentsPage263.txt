Followed sizing advice from seller and it fits perfect-I love this style!


Very nice!


The dress was beautiful!!! Just too tight. Could not zip.  They refunded me 50% and said I could keep the dress to give as a gift.


Thank you, ACEVOG. :)


Beautiful dress! I  will buy another color. I am given it 4 stars because the size is a  little large for me. Apart from that it is a beautiful dress.


Love this dress. I would like a little more room in the bust. A petite size option would be most excellent.
