This dress looks amazing! Exactly what I expected it to be and fit perfectly.


Complements after complements. I don't even know from where to start... dress is just like in pictures but when I tried, it was even better. No loosing end and I loved the fabric.


Nice dress, fits very well. I am 5'6", 170lbs size M is what I ordered


I love this dress! It's well made, fits as expected, and is beautifully flattering!


Fits perfectly. More beautiful in person.


Got so many accolades for this dress! Well-made, inexpensive, fun.


Stile is good , but tailoring is bad


The bottom of the dress is weird -front is too long and uneven,back is a lot shorter .


Looks just too bad. The top part is ok.


Love!


Fits perfectly. I LOVE IT!


My wife bought this product. She is very happy with her purchase!
