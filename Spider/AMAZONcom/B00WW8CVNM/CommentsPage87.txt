I normally wear a size 4 or 6 dress. I ordered the small and it fit great. The full skirt is forgiving for larger hips.


It was a little short for my preference so I added a cute lace trim.


I look forward to wearing it out


Dress is beautiful. It is from quality fabric and fits as expected. I am extremely happy with my purchase.


Nice Dress, arrived as pictured, medium weight material hangs nicely without needing a petticoat underneath, shrunk a bit after the 1st wash.


I'm 5'5", 155Lbs, 36DDD bust.  I got a Large and the top is a bit snug but not too uncomfortable.  It shows a bit of my back fat rolls but the pattern hides them.  I'd probably go up to an XL for a lighter solid color.


love the pattern and style but the material is horrible, rough feels horrible on skin and won't last more than a few washes.


The gap beneath the arm pits was a little wider than expected but the print was pretty and we were sorry we had to return it


This dress is gorgeous and well-made. I got compliments all day. Perfect for a 1 p.m. picnic wedding


The dress is gorgeous.  BUT, it is not a 4X at all.  More like a 2X.  I actually wear a 3X but got  the 4X JUST IN CASE.  Well, maybe my boobs are just too big.  44DDD.  So, Maybe for someone else.


I am an XS, 5'2" petite but decided to try the small anyway. It does fit fine except for the length which I will have to hem, but for the price very pleased. It is a cute summer dress.


I purchased the mint dress with polka dots and it is gorgeous! Fits as expected, super flattering, and the material feels like a good quality/ thickness. I'm 5'2" 158lbs, and I got the medium. The back has an elastic panel.  Ordered on Friday, received on Monday!


Beautiful dress for the price, but I'm afraid to wash it. The seams are a bit loose. I'm fine with wearing it once, considering the low price. I got many compliments when I wore it.
