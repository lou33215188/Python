Dress is lovely I think I was sent the wrong size great fabric


Love the dress, it fits perfectly. BUT it came with a stain on it! I am so bummed. I was supposed to wear it to a wedding.


Yes


Love the dresses!!!!


This dress is an amazing value for $19.90! I bought it at the very last minute, to have something to wear to a wedding that would complement my girlfriend's purple heather herringbone jacket.  It fit me like it was custom-made. I got tons of compliments at the wedding.


Awesome dress!  Lots of compliments.


Nice dress.


Beautiful dress, great length but does fit just a bit small. Important note: the zipper is a solid pull tab so you can't do the "thread trick" to get it zipped up when alone. You WILL need assistance in zipping it up.


Great dress and fit perfect!


Really great dress for the price. The fit was just right, and the length is perfect to wear even to work (I'm 5'9"). My only complaint would be that the high neckline bunches a bit too much when I wear a shrug.
