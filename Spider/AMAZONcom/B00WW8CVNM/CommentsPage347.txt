Nice dress ğŸ˜Š


Great dress at huge discount


Excellent


Love it  want more


A little small


I normally wear a Large, so according to the measurements that's the size I ordered.  The bodice was a little tight for my taste.  The biggest complaint is the hem was very crooked.  Over all the dress is cheaply made.  It looks like something that was made in an 8th grade home economics class.  I am disappointed and am returning the dress.


Love this dress


I returned this dress because it was too big in some areas and too small in others. The waist was tight for me but the arm holes around my bust gaped. The length was also too long and it looked like I was dressing up in someone else's clothes. I loved the material but this didn't work for me.


fast delivery,perfect fit, good material, looks so expensive, gotta order different colors


the zipper popped when I tried it ion, such a disappointment because its a super cute dress and they wont even let me return it now! I will never buy from this seller again I cannot believe this! I have to pay to have the zipper fixed because they refuse to accept a return on it now !!
