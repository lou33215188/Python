Very pleased with the fit and the quality, especially for the price!


Ordered a size, fits little small. Beautiful dress, easy to wear and does not wrinkle fast


I ordered it one size bigger but still too small. I wear a 10/12 & ordered XL. Couldn't even get it over my chest which is don't have much of one. Sent it back!


Beautiful dress! Got it as a last minute birthday party dress and got so many compliments!


These dresses are absolutely beautiful. Mine fit perfectly & looks amaziiiing. Definitely buying a lot more.


Fits great. Has good fabric and is well made!


The dress will fall apart after a few washings because the seams are not properly sewn & the material is not good quality.


Tight in the chest area hoping it fits better as I lose weight


I love my dress!


I loved this dress it fit beautifully and I got tons of compliments.
