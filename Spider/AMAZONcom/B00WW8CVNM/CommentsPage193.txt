Dress is prettier than I expected. I got the XL. A little tight in the bust (38D) but it fits.


too small


I am a size 14. Ordered a XL.  It is way too small.  No returns allowed so I am out $17.55


Simply gorgeous. Nice quality. Looks absolutely stunning.


It's beautiful, and I absolutely love it.


This dress is great! So much better than I expected it to be! My only reason for 4 stars is that the fabric is thin and is kind of see through.  You'd have to be careful what you wear under the dress.


I am 5'3 and 95lbs and I ordered a small because they didnt have extra small but it doesnt look very flattering on me and i will have to get it hemmed to fit me better. They should really come out with an extra small size though. Love the fabric and print!!!!


This was small, but too long.


really nice dress


cute dress
