pretty dress, but way too tight across chest.


Dress fit fine except large in the chest--neckline came up higher than I prefer


Very flattering and nice!


I am so happy with this dress!  It fits just as expected and is just too cute.


It definitely needs a petticoat to get the desired fluffy look. I will update with pictures after I get a suitable underskirt :)


This dress is my all-time favorite thing to wear!! I love the design and how it fits so perfectly. I feel like I'm living in an old fashioned movie every time I put it on. Thanks!!!


More elastic than I would have imagined. I love this dress. It is also much longer than I thought as it goes down to half calf.


I bought this dress for a party based on reviews. I'm not a shopper and I have a hard time finding dresses that fit. I'm 5'6 and very curvy.  This dress fit perfectly!!! I received compliments the entire night! I added a thick black belt with a silver rhinestone flower on front just to dress it up. I bought the gradient purple. U won't be disappointed!


Nice


Love this dress, made very well, got lots of compliments on this. I bought 2 more in different colors.


This dress was amazing! I got a lot of compliments and I followed the size chart when ordering and it came just as it had promised! If i need another dress for another occasion, Ill definitely be ordering another pattern of the same dress!
