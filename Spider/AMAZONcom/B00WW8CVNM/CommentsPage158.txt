Love it.  Ordered a black cumberbund-type belt to go with it.  Also ordered the crinoline - like underskirt...perfect!


I normally wear a 1-2x. I bought up to a 4x and it still wouldn't zip. So small


I am disappointed in the product due to the poor quality in the materials used and the price. I would not purchase from them again.


Great quality but too tight across the bus tline.  Ordered a larger size and it was still too tight, and I am a 36B.


really nice the flowers are not as bright as on picture


Really cute ad nice fit. The back is a little loose, but worth it.


I think xxl stood for extra extra little. It is sewn for a child not a grown woman. There was no inner lining, but the fabric a style were correct.


Not as cute in person.


love the dress. I weigh 187 and the large fits perfect


This dress was a shocker, very flattering and vibrant
