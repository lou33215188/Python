It looks like the picture. I wore it for a tea party themed bridal shower!


A little small but will wear it


Exactly as I imagine it would be. Right fit for the price


love it


love it


Looks good on.


This is the third of four I ordered and only one fit and was true to size. Buyer beware!


The dresses are beautiful!


This is a Chinese knockoff. Cheap and doesn't fit


this fit like it was made for her. beautiful!!!
