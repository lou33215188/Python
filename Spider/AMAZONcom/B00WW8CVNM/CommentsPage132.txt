The dress is a little thin, but okay for a hot Houston summer day.


This dress is so cute.  The colors really pop. I put a slip underneath because it shows thru slightly but not overly much. You will have to iron it but for the price it's worth it.


LOVE this dress!  Runs small, but I ordered a size up and it fits perfectly.  VERY flattering and comfortable!!!


did not fit as expected, top not hugging but waist fitted. Material is good.


I LOVE THIS DRESS!


I LOVE this dress!!! Looks exactly like the pictures. If not better. And it's so flattering! It looks great on me and the quality is just what I expected. I received so many compliments and felt gorgeous! Not too mention what a Great value it was! Amazon customer service exceeded my expectations when I contacted them about a delay on my order. I will definitely be buying more dresses from here!


This dress is cute on and very comfy.  I wasn't crazy about the stretchy material, but it wears very well.


I love this dress.  It fits perfectly, not too long not too short.  The fabric is quality, not thin like I expected.  I highly recommend purchasing this dress.


Wanted to love this but the quality was terrible. Stitching was off and crooked. You get what you pay for.


I got this dress because I needed something for a wedding soon, I took everyone's posted advice and went up a size, still a bit tight, complete bummer!! My daughter will be reaping the benefits of this purchase instead of myself. Really for the price its a really nice dress So sad it didn't fit right. :(
