It was somewhat small but it still fit


Wife loved the fit, she is a sie 4.


The material is not as good of quality as I expected.  The print on the dress is pretty but it is sized smaller than the size adviser states.  Order big if you're going to take the chance.


Pretty good, shrunk a bit with the first wash


Beautiful dress!


So pretty! I was nervous that it wouldn't fit because buying online is a gamble, but this one fits perfectly! I'm definitely going to get more.


Beautiful dress, wonderful purchase.


REALLY pretty! Love it!


Did not like the dress in person.


Just as everyone else said, thin material.  You better have a plain white or nude bra because otherwise it's going to shine through.  The zipper is a bit low quality and I'll likely end up replacing it in the future, but the other reviews are about spot on.
