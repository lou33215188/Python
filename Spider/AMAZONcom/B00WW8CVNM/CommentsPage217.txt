very happy with it !!!!


Supposed to be xxx.  Didnt fit at all.  Will be returning.


Snug, but gorgeous and well made.


Very beautiful


I love this dress and always get a ton of compliments when I wear it out. I'm actually 30 weeks pregnant and it looks great!  large was perfect.


saw reviews so ordered a size larger


Pretty dress, it is small in the bust for me.


I adore this dress. I wear 16w or 18. I went with a 3x after rwding that it runs small. I could have done a 2xl this dress is perfect for my larger bottom body type.


More well made than expected. The fabric is quite heavy, with a nice drape & bit of stretch (but not much). Very classy.


Loved the dress. I bought it for my 14yr old daughter. She was super excited about the dress and the size was perfect.
