Love the fabric! Fits well, a bit longer than expected but I'm 5'2". Great price.


It fit as expected. It looks great with my black pumps. Love it!!!


Ordering ever color I like. Very flattering dress.


Fits perfectly,  love the dress,  got a ton of compliments on it too!


Crazy about my dress


Fits perfectly


I wore this to for a night out and have never received so many compliments.  I was constantly being approached by, "I love your dress...your dress is beautiful".  It fit perfectly and is beautiful on.  I love it.


I'm in love with the dress, the fit was perfect.


Dress is nice but definitely not a size "large".  It would fit an older child or a teenager.


It fits as expected.  Very beautiful!
