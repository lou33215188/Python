I ordered XL. It came very mis-proportioned. Small on top. Large on bottom.  Very stiff fabric. I returned it.


I think it would be much more flattering if the neckline was a scoop and the dress material to have a little more of a cotton blend feel


Arrived on time. Just as picture beautiful and girly. I wear size 18 but the 4xl fited perfect. I'm short so i altered the length. Got lots of compliments


Love this dress. Wore it with a crinoline and it looked wonderful. Washes nicely and didn't shrink. Will buy from them again.


This dress really made me sad. I was so excited, and it was made to fit a doll


This dress is absolutely darling.  I didn't expect it to have a bow in the back which is the only complaint I have about it.  I sit quite a bit at work, and the bow is uncomfortable in the small of my back.


This dress looks like summer time. Dress it up dress it down, this dress can go everywhere. The fit is somewhat snug, so order up if your busty or thick in the middle. I did and was glad I did.


If i could only give it 5 more stars... material was great... quailtiy great... great dress


Such a sweet dress, hearkens  back to the '50s. I've gotten lots of compliments when I've worn it.


This dress fit exactly as I expected and it was long enough for me!!! I'm 6'2, and it's usually impossible to find a dress long enough but this is perfect. The material doesn't feel cheap and it's got a little bit of stretch so it feels great.
