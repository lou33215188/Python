Went by the measurement chart from Acevog and dress fit as expected and is very pretty on. It is a little tight in the bust but not so much as to flatten me out. I am very excited to hear what my friends say about it, I think it's beautiful


Does not wash up very well and is smaller after it is washed.


great fit


Really nice dress for a Hawaiian theme. They are light and my girls loved them. They fit just right to.They both were a large and their sizes are between 12 through a 14. They both said they fit comfortably. I washed them in the washer and hung dry. I wouldn't dry the dresses.


Ordered this dress for my girl friend, she plans to wear it to a wedding. She loves it.


Cute and fit well, but I didn't think the neckline on the dress looked good on me.


The fabric on this dress looked slightly different to what I imagined looking at the picture,did not see the back sash either,outside of those minor observations,loved this one also.


The dress andstyle were pretty but the size was way off.  I ordered an xl even though i wear a l.  Impossible to communicate with this company.


The body size fit as I expected the bust was too tight for me (DD) I'm not sure going up a size would help this.


Very happy with dress. I did order it a size bigger due to sizing issues in the past. Arrived earlier then expected and fit perfectly.  Color was much more vibrant than expected another plus.
