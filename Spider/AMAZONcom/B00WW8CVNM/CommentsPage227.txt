Beautiful dress but  not true to size... At All!


Returned the item.


Super Cute! The girls swim team all got this dress. We looked really good. Runs big in the chest but other then that the material is a bit stiff. I would recommend


Not made with standard size cut way small


Way smaller than other products purchased in the same size

I love it!


Very flattering fit. Enough spandex to pull on over your head, although it has a long back zipper. Doesn't flare as much as other 50's dresses. Many compliments.
