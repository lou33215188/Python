It was too big in the bust and too long for my 11 year old daughter.  She is in between sizes (between children's sizes and junior's sizes), so it was not a good fit for her.


This dress was actually kind of ugly. I didn't expect it the pattern to be so cartoony. It's also pretty long, falling well past my knees. It was a decent fabric and fit well, but I just didn't like it. So I'm attempting to return it. However, the company is trying to bribe me with $5. They said it's too expensive to ship back (as if they never expected anyone to want to return something) and offered me five dollars if I keep the dress. I told them that having a dress I hate is pointless and I want all of my money back, but we'll see how that goes. Basically, I suggest ordering from this company ONLY if you are willing to essentially throw $25 in the trash if it doesn't fit right or wasn't what you were hoping for.


Home sew poor quality copy


Exactly what I wanted for the price and style


The size worked, however, the dress arrived ripped in the middle of the front of the skirt. The "fabric" was more like paper.


Very pretty!  A timeless dress that could be worn to many different occasions.


Shipped on time. I wore this in a wedding and was comfortable all day. Im 5'1 and 198lbs. I got and XL. It fit perfectly.


Arrived on time but way tootight in chest. I went by sizing on chart. Very disappointing and not worth going through the hassle to return


It looks like something someone would sit at home and make. The stitching was crooked and did not look professional and I just was not pleased with the dress at all.


Beautiful dress.
