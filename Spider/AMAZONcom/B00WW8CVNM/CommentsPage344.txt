looks great


I love it


I love this dress!  It is simply made and may not make it through more than five dance nights but well worth it.  I ordered the small and it fit perfectly (once I added my miracle bra :) - I am typically a tall size 4.  I have the floral design so also ordered a black tutu skirt from Rockabilly to go under it and loved the subtle flair it provided.  I would recommend this dress and will look for another for myself.


Pretty but not the right fit


Very nice dress for the price!


Love it.


Too small


Love the dress. ..it's just snug.  Sized wrong


Size is not what indicated!


I received several comments about how beautiful it is.
