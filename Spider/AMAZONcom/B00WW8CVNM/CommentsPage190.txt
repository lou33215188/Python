Beautiful, but longer than depicted, and I have long legs to begin with.


Absolutely love this dress.


a little big


SUPER cute and a great value! I'm going to pick up a couple more of these in various prints. The fit is comfortable and flattering.


neckline high, good dress for price but is cotton and wrinkles fast.


Love this company's dresses. Always know how they will fit. Very true to their measurements.


I'm going to order another one, it's beautiful.


So cute! Fit perfectly!


I am a size 14 and it fits great.


I am in love with this dress!! It looks amazing on


Tight at the bust.
