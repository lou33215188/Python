love it, fit's perfect !!


this dress is so beautiful and it's stretchy.  I'm wearing it for Easter to church with a pretty cardigan.


The dress and color was as expected.  Delivery was prompt and the item was properly package.  I love the dress but hate that it may require ironing.


Read ratings and ordered larger size. Very pleased with style and modesty. Would recommend air dry only.


I loved the pattern online and in person! I so much wanted to be able to wear this dress, but it's not made for big busted women. It would not zip over my boobs! If you have boobs beware.


i bought this item for my gf i actually bought it a size bigger then she needed and it was still way to small. the item isnt even useable. so if you order this item order at least 2 sizes bigger.


I ordered according to the measurements given.  Dress fit perfect.  However the size a ordered was much larger than the size I would normally order.  I had to get over that. :) I already wore the dress to an outdoor wedding with my cowboy boots.  Too cute! Phenomenal for the price!


Zipper broke but seller was very willing to help and the rest of the dress is very nice but does run small.


I love this dress and will be keeping it, but it is a bit too big both under the arms and around the waist. Thankfully, it ties in the back so I can cinch it down. The fabric is nice and it seems well made. I bought a petticoat to wear under it and it does nicely, but the dress also hangs beautifully without it. Over all, I am happy with my purchase.


I am a small but I ordered a large since this was coming from China. It fits perfectly.
