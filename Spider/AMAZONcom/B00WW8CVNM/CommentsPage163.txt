Love my dresses!  I get lots of compliments and very comfortabl


I ordered both the red flowered and purple flowered dresses and love them! I'm usually a medium (5'4"/145/weightlifter) but ordered the large based on other reviews and the vendor size chart at the bottom, and it fit perfectly!


I'm online to order more - the quality is great, especially for the price!


what a great value,  gorgeous print and very nice fit. the price wasn't bad either.


My daughter loves this dress. It's pretty


Colors are nice, the material not too good.


It's so beautiful and fit's very nice ğŸ˜Š thanks...most of all I love the fabric


Tag says- hand wash/line dry.. I washed on delicate and dried low heat with no problem! I did have to iron it WITH starch to get all the wrinkles out, but the dress looked AMAZING once I was finished!


The dress did fit however the neck line was too high and the seem that should be below the bust was across the lower half of my breast. Also a little tight at arm pit. I returned the dress. The fabric was nice and I thought it was a nice looking print. Definitely need to wear with a petticoat.


I was afraid that it was going to hike up in the back making it too short for me but it didn't. It stayed at knee length and I'm 5'4. The only hard part is zipping it up my arms can't reach that far. Other than that it's a really cute dress


I LOVE this dress. Beautiful pattern, very flattering, and thick, sturdy fabric. I'll be getting many more colors.
