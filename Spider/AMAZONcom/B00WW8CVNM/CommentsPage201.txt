fit is small. i wear a 3x did not fit


This is my second of these dresses.  They are beautiful.


I've bought 2 of these dresses so far, and I love them so much. They're a great stretchy material and are really comfortable. I originally bought them for an office party, and they're too great to only wear once!


Very beautiful dress with stretch to it. Wore the dress & received so many compliments. Nice fabric, fits well, etc.


Had to send back was too small ordered 4X got 3X not happy


Love!!! Just got this dress today and I'm already in love with it. It fits perfectly for me. I'm so excited. I can't wait for date night!!


Loved the dress but unfortunately I received a XLarge I had ordered a small.  Nice color and material looked very nice


Pretty dress but runs really small


loved it.


Liked the print but too small for me
