The dress was really small on top so I took it and had to altered.  But I love the dress!


Great dress with nice fabric.


I was happy with the fit and quality priced I will order again


I am a DDD and this dress was way too small for me in the chest area. If you're smaller up top I suggest buying this but stay away if you're a DDD. It may fit a DD but I would say D and under. Also do not wear if you are barrel chested like me, it will not fit. For less boxy less busty women thus is a must! 4 stars!


Great fit, quality material, beautiful.


Beautiful dress, fits perfectly


Very nice dress.


Love the dress. Its beautiful.


Definitely needs a petticoat if you want the retro look.


About three sizes too small
