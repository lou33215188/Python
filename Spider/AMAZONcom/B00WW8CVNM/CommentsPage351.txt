I love this dress, it fits good and having the extra stretch makes it comfortable.


Smelled like vinegar when it arrived.  Couldn't try it on for three days because I had to wait for the smell to dissipate. When I tried it on, was disappointed to find out that the chest area was too small.  I wear a C cup and it was uncomfortable!


Good quality  true sizes. I love it.was on time no smells. Awesome


Beautiful. Didnt feel as if it were cheaply made like i was worried about. I am a 1x normally and i ordered 2 sizes up (3x) and it fits like a dream. First dress ive found that is really flattering to my curvy figure!


Received this dress today, was disappointment with the width.  Its so very wide.  Will have to get a seamstress to cut off some of the width.  Dress fits ok


Fabric and print are nice.  Size small fit as expected.  Daughter is 5'5 and it came above knees.  Prefer a longer length for a more vintage look


Freaking beautiful y'all!! Comes down pass my knees, so its church tolerable! Fabric is comfy, & NOT cheap looking either thank God.


Cute dress. I ordered a larger size so it would fit...but it is WAY TOO LONG.  I am 5'3" and it went past my mid calf.  Other than that, very cute.


I had to order three times my normal size to finally get correct size.


I got this to wear at a wedding in August. I also bought the lace petticoat for fluffiness in the skirt.  The material is nice and design is awesome!
