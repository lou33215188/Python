The dress fit small. I would go 1 size larger. A beautiful dress


Beautiful dress. Nice value for the price.


Gorgeous!


I love this dress and material is excellent


If you think you measurement is going to be 1/4 an inch of it's not it is snug yet fits perfect. I can slip it on over my head I don't even have to unzip it.


was big sent it back I am a 38dd size 16 and it ran slightly big


I ordered  sz XXL , I received the dress in sz XL and the zipper won't close after unzipping. Nice dress, I would like to order the same dress but concerned I won't receive the correct sz again.


I really love this company their dresses are fantastic!!


This dress is gorgeous and extremely flattering.  I highly recommend.


Material is light
