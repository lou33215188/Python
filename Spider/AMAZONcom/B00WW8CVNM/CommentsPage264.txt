Great Dress!  I bought this dress on a whim (while watching American Graffiti!) and am really glad I did.  The fabric is much better quality than I expected for the price I paid and the style is supper cute.  Worn over a petticoat, it has just the right amount of swing.  I ordered a medium based on my measurements and the fit is great. If I had to find one flaw, it would be that the neckline is a smidge too high on me.  It's an easy fix if you know how to sew, which I do, but not terribly bothersome.  I'll probably cut it down at some point, but it's totally wearable as is.  There are several other colors and styles I plan on ordering and at this price, with Prime shipping and free returns if there's a problem, I'll have a new '50's wardrobe in no time!

Cute and very comfortable!


To small


Exactly what I was expecting


I want to love this dress but the darts by the chest are not in the right place so it just looks weird when I put it on. Haven't left the house wearing it yet and likely won't :(


The size is way off too small I was so disappointed. A beautiful dress


Wonderful fit! LOVE IT!!!


Very good
