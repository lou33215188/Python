It's so hard to tell sizes... with International orders. So I ordered 1-2 sizes bigger... and it fits!


Too short for me (5'7") and, somewhat surprisingly, for my friend who is 5'4". We like a longer length, I guess.


The quality of the fabric and sewing is great. I had to return it because it was very big. I ordered a size up based on the other reviews, but it was way too large for me.


I ordered a 3X ... it didn't fit.  My daughter, who is a SIZE 5, tried it on and it fits her perfectly except its a bit big in the underarms,  RIDICULOUS sizing!


Super cute!! Fits well, it is a full skirt that you can wear a petticoat under if you wish. Tons of compliments when I wear this!!


Super cute, love the material!  Long enough to wear to work with any sort of reasonable dress code.  Buy a size or two up, though, because it does run that way.


I love this dress! The fabric is beautiful! Not just the design, but the feel of the fabric! I can't wait til the weather is warmer so I can wear this dress out!


I loved everything about this dress! The fit and length was perfect! It came in a cute bag that makes storage quick and easy!


Giving the dress to a friend, I hate a tied belt this dress has one , you cannot tell by the picture.


I'm 5'3", and i weigh 150 lbs. I got a Large, and it fits great! i may have to get it hemmed, but i love the way it looks! Also, its lighter than the picture, because the purple flowers have white in them too.
