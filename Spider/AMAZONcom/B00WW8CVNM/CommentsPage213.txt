I could not have picked a more perfect dress to wear for Derby Day! I am a size 10 (5'6, 170lbs) normally and went with the medium.


Love these dresses. I have three so far and all are amazing!!


Dress was tight, not made for plus size woman, chubby woman but not plus, plus, lol but shipping ead great got it in plenty of time for the wedding, but couldn't wear it, to small, so dad, I loved that dress.


Fits beautifully. Thick material.


Love it cant wait to family pictures in it


Beautiful dress! I will purchased more from this company!


Note: If you have boobs C cup or larger - this dress will not hit at the waist and will be more of an empire waist dress.  Still cute - just a different look than I was expecting.


For the price paid - the item is appropriately crafted.


i love it


too long


great dress and great color. good fit but poorly made.  the zipper won't zip all the way up. too bad.  quality control should have doubled and tripled checked it before sending out.
