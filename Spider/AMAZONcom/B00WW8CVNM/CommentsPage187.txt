Buy up 1 size.  Nice dress.


Fits small as I am plus size-ordered 2 sizes bigger than I wear, nice packaging, shipped quick, may order again from company but plus sizes are limited in cute prints.


I love it. Very classy.


I love this dress. I ordered it for my bridal shower and the theme is retro house wife. It fits perfect!


Material too thick


Beautiful dress. My daughter usually wears an S, this is what I ordered, it fit fine, a little big, but fine. She is tiny,100 lbs, 5ft. Its well made, nice material, not cheap at all. Great buy!


Cute. This is about a 14 US


I had to make it smaller, but is a beautiful dress.


Lovely dress. A little large around the bust area, but still completely wearable. The fabric is actually shiny, so don't expect a matte cotton look.


The pic looks like there is grey in the dress so I ordered grey shoes. There is no grey in this dress but I still like it.
