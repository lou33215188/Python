Wore to church Easter Sunday. Received a lot of complements. Fit really well. I am busty have hips. Very cute with a little sweater. Follow manufacturers fit guide.


These dresses are absolutely stunning!  They are made very well, and they're just beautiful.  SO many compliments, I can't count them.


way to small.  I ordered an XL because of the other reviews.  What I received was closer to a s/m.  I had to return it.


Looovvvvveee this dress!!! It's so classy.


It came very fast and packaged well. Tried it on and loved it! I know some women bought petticoats for theirs but I like it just the way it is. I'm 5'5 125lbs 35 bust and got the medium. It fit perfect and just the right length. Can't wait to wear it!


Dress fits ok but Bust size is way too small. The waist size is ok but couldn't zip up due to smaller bust size on the dress.


Really nice, cute dress with a thicker fabric. It fit pretty much as expected so I'd say it runs fairly true to size.


Fit perfectly, I went by what people said in their reviews regarding the sizes. I got so many compliments at the wedding I went too. Will definitely buy in other colors.


Beautiful dress.  Extremely comfortable.  I get a lot of compliments every time I wear this dress.


This dress is well made and fits like a glove. I'm a size 12 and ordered a large. It falls a little below the knee which is fine with me. I adore it and love the sash!
