I love this dress. Built well and beautiful. The material is good quality.


Their sizing is inconsistent.  I bought blue polka dot dress which was very nice on me and the length was just at the knee.  Again I order two more in


 the same size and they are short.  Not sure why they are inconsistent in sizing


I wish i didnt get a XXL Its big i dont have to use the zipper i can just pull it over my head. I have a large chest 42D i thought i would need the room. I'm a size 6-8 in pants and dresses are hard to fit for me.There is never enough room for my chest so i can breathe not this dress alot of room i think a large or XL would have been better. But for my grandmother's funeral it will work


This dress is so cute! I ordered it for a wedding. Initially I was a bit worried about the fit but so happy when it arrived and fit like a glove! The fabric is a cotton mix so it is a bit stretchy. Looks lovely with a full petticoat underneath. Quality is great for the money, very well made. I will definitely buy from this seller again. :)


cute dress, make sure you order a size or two up.


Love love love this dress I did order one size larger just in case and it fits.


I bought a XXXL; overall it fits well, except that I had to get the neck altered because it fitted a little too close. I'm a black woman with a lot of curves; 44" bust, 37" waist & 48" hips, my dress size is 16-18, this dress facilitated my shape perfectly.


great product, shipped quickly, looks much more expensive. Very flattering and below the knee length.


It has survived the wash, and looks just like new as long as you iron it. I get tons of compliments. I feel like I'm cheating that it was only $20.


Cute dress! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it wrinkles very easily.
