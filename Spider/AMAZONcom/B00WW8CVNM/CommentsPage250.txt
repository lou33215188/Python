Very nice dress. I ordered using the sizing chart and it fits as expected.


The size chart is off it fits much smaller. I returned one dress to order 2 sizes up. The color was way off but a nice dress


This dress fit me perfectly. Has held up well in the laundry ..


Beutifull


I loved this dress color was amazing but I have a bigger chest and it was to small.


Love the Dress and the Material is wonderful. Nice dress to wear to work or Function!


Not meant for short girls


I order this dress for a baby shower, and I love it. It fits really nice. The quality is pretty good. I just Love it. '


It s still pretty just not sized correctly


I like the stretch in the fabric
