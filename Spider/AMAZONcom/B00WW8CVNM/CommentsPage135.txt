Was good for church


nice


Purchased the Acevog retro dress and it's absolutely stunning! Well made and crafted. I normally wear a large but based on reviews as to the fit, I went with the XL. Perfect fit. Beautiful material. The dress I received was exactly as shown and described. I'm definitely purchasing more. I wrote this of my own free will... I paid for my dress myself and I was not compensated in any way to leave this review.


I ordered up a size based on many of the reviews, but I think it runs truer to size than I anticipated.


Pleased with this purchase. Fits as expected.


I bought this for my son's girlfriend and she looks adorable in it!  If you you are broad in the back or have a large chest it will be too tight.


This dress is a super great value. Fit as expected. On average I wear a size 8 - medium fit perfect. It's fitted in the bodice. The dress arrived in less than two weeks. Received a couple of compliments when I wore it on a cruise for dinner. Very pleased with it! Only a 4 star instead of a 5 because it does require ironing after you wash it.


Wore the dress today and got a ton of compliments. Like this dress so well, I'm tempted to buy another in a different color. Would highly recommend.


The fit is good but this dress is not the quality I was looking for. The fabric is nice but the seams are crooked along the waist line. Though it is absolutely wearable and  I could chose to wear it as is, I will probably have my seamstress correct the problem.


Beautiful dress!  Well made, and looks adorable with or without a petticoat!
