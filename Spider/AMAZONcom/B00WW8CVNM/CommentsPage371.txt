Beautiful dress, but the neckline was not sewed correctly.  Had to return.  Might try one more if it still has free returns to see if I have better luck.


Really glad I bought this dress. It fits me well and the fabric is super soft.


I got this dress a few weeks ago, and it's amazing!!! Very flattering, and the purple floral print is super pretty. I followed the measurments and got a large, it fits perfectly. :) I do wish the skirt was a little fuller on its own without the need for a petticoat - I can't wear one with it because it would make it too short for my needs. :( Also, it would be nicer if the ties were longer. Other than those very minor details, though, it is amazing! I definitely recommend.


Super cute!


A very feminine dress! It has stretch quality, and the fabric is not too thick. It takes you back to the 70's.


Love this dress. It's super cute on and fits really well.  Even if I never wear it again,  you can't beat the price


I really love this dress. it looks so beautiful and the fit is just perfect


Cute prints! Pleasant for my body shape and the fabric is not itchy to skin compare to its price.


Fit beautifully!


Lovely quality and very pretty. Fit me well, and it fit elegantly and as expected.
