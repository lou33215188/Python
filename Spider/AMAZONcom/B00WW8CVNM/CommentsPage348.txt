My wife took it straight out of the package and simply unzipped the dress and the bottom of the zipper tore off the dress. Poor sewing job on the zipper. She bought a M because it claimed to be bust wise up to 37", but it barely fit there as well. BUY A SIZE LARGER!


Very very upset, I ordered a black and white polkadot dress size 3 X . I got  a flower dress medium  and I need this for the Friday before Halloween.


Like it ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


Perfect!


My wife loves this dress. Being plus size can be an issue for dresses like these because sellers don't often label measurements accurately but this on seems about right (we bought the 3xl. Seems to fit a 16 to 20w). Has a couple loose threads though, so 4 stars.


Nice fabric but cheaply made - I could see all the seams.  The top across the breasts is too small and does not match the measurements on the item description.  The shoulders and arm holes were entirely too bi.  I am returning this item.


Looking at the size chart I bought an XXL.  The dress I received had a waist measured at 30", no the 39-40 inches in the size chart.  The seller refunded $3.59 of the $17.99 I paid and said I could keep the dress.  I took it to work where it fitted a co-worker who wears size s/m perfectly.  Its a very pretty dress and wondering if I want to try again, since some people seem to have gotten dresses that were true to the size ordered.


I'm 5' 3", 130, 34 C.  The small fit perfectly.  It was a bit longer than I would normally wear but the entire silhouette was so flattering. Very happy with this purchase.


Perfect! Super excited to wear this dress for my son's birthday and sisters bridal shower!


Watch sizes...mine was too small, little did I know you can't return for a larger size.  They offered $4.00, I buy another one, hope it's ok.  The material and workmanship are fine, and you can't beat the price.  BUT BASICALLY YOU CANNOT RETURN IT.
