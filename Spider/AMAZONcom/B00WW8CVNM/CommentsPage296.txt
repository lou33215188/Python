LOve this dress. Very  comfy !


Beautiful dress, but too small. I will keep it.


fabric was a little disappointing however the dress fit very well


Much better in person!


Loved the look of the dress, but very cheap zipper that split before I even put the dress on.


I'm keeping the dress, But I would not have bought this dress if it was in a dept. store.


my score from 1 to 10 would be a 6.5


Just too long for me but I still like it


The dress was beautiful but it didn't fit well despite measuring myself before hand. Dress runs a bit small


The size is more like a child's  waist size. Wanted to return  it for a refund  but they only gave me $4.00


Excellent fit. Lovely dress. Material is a little sensitive to wrinkling.
