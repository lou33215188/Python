Super cute, fits great and is super flattering! Love this dress!


the fabric has some stretch so its a beautiful fit. The type of garment that looks good on most figures.


This is a beautiful dress, but the sizing is just too small for US sizes. I couldn't zip it up. :-(


Pretty but more white and not as much pattern as I expected and wrinkles easily.


I am happy with the overall dress. I used the measurements for the sizing and didn't have a problem. Looking forward to ordering other colors.


This dress is so pretty and comfortable,be sure to check the sizing chart for this dress,it fits well and I really like the fabric,I love the way it flares below the waist,it is so feminine and if you ware a petticoat with it,it acentsuates it even more,I get alot of compliments when ever I wear this dress,it's good to wear for a night out on the town,to work or any other occasion ,I love the floral design


I love this dress! The fabric is a bit stretchier than I anticipated, but that is a nice feature for comfort and ease of wearing.


Had a small rip in the back off dress along the seam but I did not feel like sending it back (easy to fix) Material is thin.  Feels like a cheap dress but does not look like one


Bought this item for my daughter's, so three different dresses.  They fit perfectly.  Got it in blue flowers, red flowers, and purple flowers.  They all were great material is nice, just all around great dresses.  Will buy from this brand again.


Beautiful dress but zipper was already torn from fabric out of the package. Overall sewing could be more secure. i will send to cleaners instead of sending it back.
