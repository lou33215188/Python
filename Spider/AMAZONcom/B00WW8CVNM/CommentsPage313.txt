It's was as described


The picture appears to detail a flared skirt, there is no flare at all, It looks like an oversized apron.


Really like it, seems quality made, fits as expected. Length longer than expected, to knee slightly below


Not a great choice for bustier women.


Beautiful but looks casual

Absolutely love this dress!


I got a large which said it would fit me but it was really hard getting this dress on. I had to I'll it over my head instead of stepping into it. And although the image shows a nice swoop to the neck mine was basically a straight line and way to high for me. Loved the pattern but it was way to much fabric on the neck line and the bottom as well. The tie around the waist was to far forward instead on the sides. You could totally see on the front of the dress. Wish it had worked out :/
