This dress is absolutely adorable. I love it. I would get a petticoat for underneath it though to flare it up. The one I have makes the dress look adorable. Gonna wear it to a wedding.


Great,  super cute.  A little hard to zip up by yourself even when there is room once it is zipped up.


While it fits neatly in most places, the bust of this dress is NOT for the well endowed, nor for those with broad shoulders. Buy at your own discretion!


The dress is beautiful and the material is excellent. Unfortunately the sizes run small. I returned the dress once, and the second time I received a partial refund and I kept the dress. It became too expensive to return the dress. I would love to buy the dress again, but I am afraid of not getting the right size. Thank you very much.


Love everything about this dress!

I just love this dress!! Material is stretchy and just a really nice dress for the price. It fit a little big but not noticeable. I will be ordering other dresses from this company.

Love love love it. Super cute. I felt great when I wore it. Only things it needed were pockets!
