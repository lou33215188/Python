Beautiful dress!


This dress is beautiful but not true to size. Fitted form and waist area is more like a large or XL. It fit a friend who is dress size of a size 14 or 16.


A very nice dress any occasion, love the fit, style, and pattern


This dress is beautiful , very flattering I'm a size 18 and order a 3X it's perfect


BEAUTIFULLY complementary to daughter's figure.  She got lots of compliments at swing dance!


It's a nice dress but plain color so I look that great on me


This dress was definitely a nice surprise.


It is kind of see through, since it's not lined; but for the price, what would you expect?


I used a petticoat and got so many compliments on it.


I love it!  Will definitely buy in another color :D


I returned it.  But it was made well and if it had looked better on me, I would have kept it.


WAY too long, Im 5ft6 and it reached almost my ankles! I look like a grandma in this dress!


This company is in China. It will cost me over $50 to return the dresses that do not fit.
