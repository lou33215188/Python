I love this dress, it was purchased for a attending a wedding and it was great!


The dress is lovely, however 2 sizes too small, maybe since this seems to be everyone's complaint the company needs to do some adjusting to their quality control.  Clothing shouldn't be that much off.


Love it. Flows right and is very lovely.


It's cheaper looking than I expected and little tight around chest area. But This could be very nice summer dress with cute heals.


Love this dress I'll be buying more!


EXTREMELY cute, got lots of compliments. Very good quality for the price


Love the dress right out of the bag.


I wanted to love this dress. It was a size too large and the material was awful. It was this heavy material that had no movement.


very nice


This is a really nice dress.  A bit too small around my waist and stomach area, so I had to return both dresses.  I bought the white dress like this black one, as well.


I would recommend this dress.  Please keep in mind, if you wear US 16, you should order US 18 instead..
