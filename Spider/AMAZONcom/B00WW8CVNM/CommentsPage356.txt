The dress fit my daughter perfectly. It was a breeze to iron. The fabric and workmanship is great. We will definitely buy more of these dresses.


Labeled XL, fit a lady who wears XS!


Wore it first time tonight. Fits just right. Looks amazing. Very classy dress. Definitely love this dress, glad I purchased it.


I have the perfect shoe for this dress


Although I love this dress and received many compliments, it is snug at the bust.


I bought two dresses just the same and this one is much smaller. I was disappointed.


Cute dress, well made, fits true to sizing chart.


Arrived in 12 business days with "regular" shipping.


Will buy from this vendor again!


I did receive this item and I love it


Got so many compliments on this dress the first time I wore it.


The fabric and fit was disappointing.  I have a long torso and this dress had a very short torso. The waist line fell above my natural waist. Also, it doesn't help that my bust is large (40DDD). There just wasn't enough room up top.
