Nice and good looking dress


Didn't fit as expected.


Nice dress


Really love this dress. I went up a size just to be safe and I'm glad I did because it's a little snug in the chest area. Also, the dress I received ties in the back and doesn't in the pics. Over all I'm still happy with the dress and will order another color.


Looks great, fits great. Worth the money.


I love the dress I wish it was shorter than what it was It was too long and I'm 5/1 in but its a beautiful dress


It runs small but it fit someone else perfect.


love it


Dress tight in the bust, but other than that its great. I really love the material it feels like cotton.


Beautiful!  The beauty is enhanced by the fit.  Love it!
