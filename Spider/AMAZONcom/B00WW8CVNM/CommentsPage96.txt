Absolutely perfected.  I'm a size 8ish and ordered a medium -- absolutely no problems.  I was also very pleased that it was a white dress that wasn't completely transparent.


Love this dress! I'm 5'3" and it fit perfectly. Good quality and material looks great right out of the dryer. Had so many compliments on it.


Super cute, but runs small. I normally wear a 12 and ordered the XL. It zipped but was uncomfortable in the bust. I returned it. Sad day because I really did like the dress. The material is nice and seems to be well made, it has a slight stretch.


This is a beautiful vintage dress.  It is of high quality and I will be wearing this for years to come.


I ordered different design and I got this one , but I still like the dress. So , I am keeping it.


Cute dress. Does not fit too well in the waist area. It seems to only look good on short waisted women. Other than that, this is a great buy.


Unfortunately, although I thought it was very pretty, I had to return it because it was way too small.  I had read the other reviews which suggested using your chest measurement and ordering a size up. I did measure and still ordered bigger than the measured size but I could see as soon as I took it out of the package that it was never going to fit.  I tried it anyway hoping my eyes were wrong but no. Sad!


Very cute dress. Fits as expected and very nice quality.


The dress is pretty, but too way too long to arrive and you need to order it two sizes larger than you normally wear. Don't bother to try to return.  It comes from China and will cost $21 to return.


This dress is beautiful in person. It is well made and the stitching is accurate....darts are all in the right places. It fits perfectly and runs true to size. It is also very comfortable...perfect for Sunday church services or just a walk around an outdoor craft fair. I am always receive compliments when I wear it.
