Everything I hoped it would be! I ordered a medium: I'm 5'2", 148 lbs, 34C bosom, and it is perfect. It's comfortably snug, but I would have trouble if my chest were further endowed. I think my measurements are the extent of what a medium could fulfill, I could've ordered a large for more room but then it might not have showed off my curves as well! I think it would've still fit well, especially with a large belt to help accentuate the waist (it comes with a built-in tie around the waist that's very flattering whether you tie it in the front like a bow, or tie it behind you--a thick belt could easily conceal it), but I enjoy the form-fitting look. It's not as stretchy as say spandex but it doesn't lock you in place, either; it has some give to it so you can comfortably move. The fabric has a nice weight to it, but I personally wouldn't try to wear this in really hot weather, it's perfect for cooler weather and decent for mild Spring-like warmth. If you've had this in your wishlist for months like I have, deciding whether it's worth it or maybe too good to be true for such a price--go ahead and buy it while it's still in stock!


This is a very pretty and feminine dress. I'm glad I bought it.


Gave it two stars because the dress style is cute, material is nice BUT Runs small.  Workmanship sucks!  The zipper is sewn closed half way down and couldn't even get it on.  Returning.


Running very small. Like 2 dress sizes small


Love it
