Just amazing!


I loved it :)


Seems to run about 2 sizes too small


This extra large did not fit, it was too small. Fit an american that is normally a medium to large.


The waistline is supposed to fall at the natural waist but is was about 6 inches too high. Almost an empire waist.


It was a nice dress.


Overall I like the dress the sizing seems a little off. Of course, it could just be me ğŸ˜˜


perfect dress to gift


Fits perfectly


Exactly as expected!


Made an underskirt and gave it that vintage look I wanted.


It's a beautiful dress, but my bust size is 40DD I weigh 238 I ordered a 2x I thought it would fit but it didn't...


I loved this dress! By far one of my favorites!!
