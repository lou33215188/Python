wife absolutely loves this dress


This dress was amazing! It fit perfectly and is so pretty! Thank you so much! I think my Irish father-in-law appreciated it for his visitation. Xoxo


The cutest dress ever fits like a glove and amazing!!


I love this dress!  It fits perfect!  I added a crinoline slip for poof and it makes it even better!  Looks EXACTLY like the picture!


I wore this today and received many compliments. I wish the waist was just a little bit lower, but it has a great length overall and the colors are vibrant. The cotton fabric feels sturdy and the design is fresh and cute. A great price for a great dress.


Great dress - I wore this to my sisters Bridal shower and it was a big hit


I like the dress very much, just thought that skirt will be more fluffy


LOVE this dress. Absolutely gorgeous and fit just right. The hem hits about mid calf and it's fin to spin around in! Would purchase again


It fits as expected according to their own size chart. The fabic is nice, it shrinks a lot, but nice. I think I will wear it for the evening, not for a party but somewhat is elegant.
