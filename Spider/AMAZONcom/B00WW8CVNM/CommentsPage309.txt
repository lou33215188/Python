The dress fits and looks greeat. However; I thought it was going to be more of a silky material.

Wonderful dress! Especially for the price! Wore it for my birthday and everyone loved it, including myself :)


Cannot even close it at my chest.


Beautiful dress!  Love it!


Runs very small. Fabric is thin as well. What looked like a bargain turned out to be not.


It's a very pretty dress just a little to big
