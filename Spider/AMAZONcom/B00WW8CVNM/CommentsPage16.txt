First thing: this is absolutely beautiful for an inexpensive dress. I bought two right off the bat and will be purchasing many more. That being said - the dresses are unlined, it's just the one piece of fabric so it's not the most luxuriously made garment (though it's important to note that even though it's unlined, it's NOT transparent).  Lucky me - I'm in Florida and that helps keep the bulk and the heat down - so it worked in my favor. Some may want to layer a petticoat under it for volume to get the real 50s housewife vibe out of them. Me - it's a simple dress that looks more put together than the effort required to put it on. It hits just at the knee for me at 5'6 which is perfect and doesn't smush my chest which is a hard find in dresses. For $25ish dollars - I plan on having one of every color - though I will say I'm not too confident in the longevity of the dress and will be washing them on cold gentle cycles and hanging up to dry because I have this inkling feeling that shrinkage will be a factor for the future.


Absolutely LOVE this dress! This is the first time in over ten years that I have worn a dress & it was worth it for my best friends wedding. I received sooooo many compliments. I ordered an XL just to make sure it fit & had a bit of room to work with. Very comfortable. I also bought the Grace KarinÂ®Women's 50s Petticoat Skirts Tutu Swing Skirt Underskirts CL8922 and it added that little extra something to it. HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking for a classy, fun dress.


I bought the red and black flowered one with the with background and the solid black one. I bought the red and black in a medium and the black one in a small. I'm 5' 7" and 140 pounds with a size 28 inch waist. Both sizes fit well but the small does need to streach to fit me which I know will shorten the fabrics life, so future buys wi be medium. The fabric is a soft cotton blend with a good amount of streach so it fits like a loving glove. ğŸ˜� I will be buying more dresses from this buyer. Heres a tip too buy a petty coat to complete the look. And a corset to make it beautiful on the body. ğŸ˜‰


Love the dress, but the fit was not right. I ordered a large (I usually order medium but based on reviews, went for large) and it fit perfectly around the hips but was too large in the waist and bust (and I'm a busty person). I tried tightening the sash on the waist, but that only served to make top part "bloom". Returning it and trying again with a medium.


It's a beautiful dress with a very nice fabric, not stiff but not flimsy. The flounce at the bottom is lovely, too.


This dress is truly lovely, but too short for my standards. I am adding some length to. It did not reach my knees and I am only 5'4''.


The colors on this dress are vibrant! There isn't anything that I don't like about this dress!!! I love that it is calf-length. I would recommend this dress for anyone. I love it!


bought for my 13 year old and she looks great in it! we were looking for dresses that were too kiddie but not all grown up either.  plus while she is pretty tall she isnt exactly "busty" either. so this style is perfect. she says it is very comfortable


This dress is too big and too small all at the same time.  How is that even possible??  I ordered the small size. The top is too large on me and has a big gap by the neck and chest area.  I'm really not that flat chested - just small.  However, the waist is too tight.  I got a belly (I'm 5'7, 121 llbs, with a baby belly).  If you have a little bulge, this dress will certainly bring it out.


I love the length - It is so hard these days for me to find dresses that are decent and cover my knees so I was very afraid... But this dress is long enough. I would need to wear something underneath on a windy day but it is a lovely, lovely dress.  My first dress in a long time!!


Everything good to say about this dress.Love the print-- bold, fun, but not obnoxious. I ordered a large; probably should have gotten a medium. I am going to be wearing this at a Cirque Du Soleil show for my 30th bday.


P.S.-- pair it with red shoes.. you won't regret it!


*Update 1 year later- I can't believe how many compliments I get when I wear this dress!  I wore to a wedding tonight and nearly a dozen women complimented me on it. I got the white/black/red print. Paired with white petticoat (feel so pretty!) And bright red shoes. Worth it!


If your reading this and still on the fence... Just buy it. It's worth it! Hands down my favorite dress and I'm buying another (different print) soon.


Beautiful dress, nice fabric.  If it had been advertised as an empire waist I'd be giving it 5 stars. (Although I would not have purchased it in the first place if it were.)  Arm holes and waist line maybe --maybe-- 3" apart. Waist hit right at bra band, and I'm not overly tall.  Per pictures from other reviewers, it doesn't look like this happens with all sizes/colors, but you can see in some of them the waist is really high.  So you may have luck with a different color (mine was blue with flowers) or size (I bought large.)  Sizing otherwise seemed spot on and I could keep and wear it, but empire waist does not work for me.  Returning.
