I bought this in the purple flower print for my 13 year old daughter who is 5'9 and 150lbs.  She wears a 36C bra, 8/10 in women's shirts and 10 in pants. I bought her a medium and it fit perfectly.  Not too tight in the bodice and hit just at the knees for her, she's a tall kid. This looks beautiful on, is a great thick material with solid seams and zipper. I liked it so much that I want one for myself and she wants more in other colors. This looks so nice and classic, especially in a sea of girls wearing dresses and skirts so short that nothing is left to the imagination.


The dress didn't meet my expectations because I ordered a 3x for my mom and she normally wears a 3x in clothes, but it fit me and I normally wear a size 12. The dress that I got for me didn't fit at all!


Love it!!


Since I had read the reviews that stated it fit small, I bought the dress 2 sizes bigger and it fit perfect! Love this dress!


I very carefully checked the size chart and read reviews.  I ordered a size larger, just to be safe.  The dress is at least 3 sizes too small. The seller advised me to give it friends or family. Not acceptable.


Appears a bit large at first, but fits fine once you adjust the belt.


Beautiful print. I absolutely love this dress and I can't wait to wear it.


Love it


Love the style


Love this dress!!
