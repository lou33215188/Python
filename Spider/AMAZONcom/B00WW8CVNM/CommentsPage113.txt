The dress is beautiful, but was a little small around the bust, and that is saying something from me because I am small busted,  o could still wear the dress, so I kept it.


My dress arrived today and it fit! I got a size 3x and I am normally a size 18 so I was afraid it would be too large but it future perfectly.  The material could be nicer but it will do and there it was badly wrinkled but fixable


Very tight in bust area. I wear a 2x, went up a size 3x. My bust size is  a 40 D. Was made nicely and love the material. But will return them both


I love this dress. I feel like I should be in a Doris Day movie. It is good quality and nice fabric. You will need to steam or iron it however.


I absolutely LOVE this dress.  Fit is perfect! color is vibrant!  It was a b-day present to myself and I wore to my b-day dinner - so many compliments.  I can't wait to wear it again.


Love the color, it fits just right. The material is not has I thought for cotton mixed with something else but I would recommend this product. Price was great.


I love it, I did order 3 sizes larger then I have ever worn


So it does run really small , love the color and roses


This dress fit perfectly and I am a very chesty person so I was afraid it wouldnt. Its made very well and fit even better. If you want it poofy, I would recommend getting a petticoat for underneath.


Love the dress, but can't put it on by myself and I live alone.  There is NO way for me to get the zipper all the way up and, since the zipper pull is very small and solid, you can't hook a device on it to assist.  May never get to wear the dress. Not a clue how to resolve this.  Sigh.


LOVE THIS DRESS.  I feel great in it, and I always get compliments every time I wear it.
