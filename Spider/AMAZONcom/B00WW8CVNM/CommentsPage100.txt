This dress had the worst workmanship I have ever seen.  Loose stitching everywhere, long thread ends all over the garment, no lining.  An otherwise lovely dress was ruined by poor workmanship.


The dress is beautiful but runs large. I'm returning it & buying it in a smaller size


This is a beautifully made dress.  5'4" 115lbs, ordered a small and it fit perfectly.  Also ordered a petticoat to wear with it and that dressed it up even more, but looks beautiful as is.  :)


So pretty. Wrinkles a bit easier than I was hoping. Does require some ironing.


But the dress was great and I felt great in it.


A little bigger/longer than what I expected but still a very pretty dress! My friends love it!


A lot longer then I thought and does not come with a care label on how to wash it or if I need to have it dry cleaned. Arrived before the actual date of arrival.  I like the way it fits and it's what you actually see in the picture.


dress pretty but sizing is off and being that i know how to sew waste is to small to be considered plus size and match dress but love packaging


Even though the neckline is higher than I expected (not the most flattering on a very full bust)  The material and pattern are beautiful.  I would suggest this dress for a c cup or smaller.


Beautiful dress - but fits like an extra small. I usually wear a medium, but I couldn't even get this over my arms.


I rate this a 3 because it runs to small.  I normally wear a 16 so I ordered the XXL as the size says 18-20 because some dressers run a size maller.  I was so excited when it came just to be let down. The material was soft and the dresses colors were vibrant which I love BUT  It was to small.  I am contemplating on ordering  the  next size up.
