Beautiful! Beautiful!!! Have not regretted purchasing this


It'll do. Not real crazy with it. But it's better than the worst i expected.


This dress is nice,  I like the blue flowers  The only thing I don't like the short  attach type of belt to the back it reminds me of a child's dress


I'd give this five stars if it came with pockets.


Cute. Had a really bad acrylic odor that came out in the wash but so did some threading


I read the reviews first and ordered a large for my size 4 daughter. It's a bit long and little big in the shoulders but seems well made.


really cute. longer than i expected! A little tight around my back! But fits good!


This is such a pretty dress! I ordered up in size, and it came in very fast and fitting great! I ordered the green for St. Patrick's Day, and I'm sure it'll look perfect. I've tried it with and without a crinoline skirt under, and both ways are very flattering.


I haven't worn this yet, just tried it on.  Somewhat rigid material, which may loosen up when I wash it.  Comes down to about mid-calf on me, and I'm 5'3.


size chart is way off really narrow in the shoulders.
