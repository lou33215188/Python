Great fit, got loads of compliments at July 4th party.


Fits a little snug, but got lots of compliments on it.


will not purchase from is company a gain.  tooooooo small for the size that's on the dress


skirt nice but top too small for a 34B


Color and materials are great. Ordered a medium for my significant other. She wears a medium in everything, but this was too big. Will be returning and ordering a size small.


ordered my size and couldn't get it on.  Would suggest size larger than what you wear


Very pretty on and looks as good after its been laundered. Well made.


This dress fit like a charm...:)


The dress was way too small and was different than pictured. I was able to pass it on to a friend though.


Cute dress! Nice and great for the price.
