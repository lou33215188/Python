Beautiful dress.  Needed a good ironing.  I also had to restitch  the darts because they were opening.


This dress is amazing!!! I too like all the other girls was told all day just how pretty my dress was! I love the length and the fabric it has a small amount of stretch so it's so comfortable. I work in an office and I wore it all day and not one time did I want to rip it off lol.


This is a beautifully patterned dress, the picture does not do it justice.  However, the sizing runs small.


Love this dress but make sure you hang to dry. It will shrink in dryer. I was able to iron it back out and still love it.


I received the wrong dress even though my order clearly states what I bought.


I am so pleasantly surprised at how well this dress is made and fits.  I ordered the XL, I am a 36-32-48 not a typical size but it complements my figure quite nicely.  I plan on getting another,  hell maybe even two.


This dress is amazing! Great quality...especially for the price. I ordered this to wear to a wedding and got all kinds of compliments. I would recommend wearing a petticoat to get that full skirt effect.


too short and too tight. Its aweful. Dont buy the blue its not as nice as the flowered one I bought earlier


Ordered this for my sister.  Put in her size and it fit like a glove!  Don't pass this dress up!!!


Material is nice. A lot longer than I'd  expected. It is cut a little weird at the front neckline and bubbles out. The zipper gets stuck in spots because of how is sewn in.
