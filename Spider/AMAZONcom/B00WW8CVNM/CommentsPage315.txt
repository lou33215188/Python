My dress  was perfect fit. Everirhing fine thanks.


Pretty dress atad tight in the bust. But cute I gave it to my mom who's smaller in the top than me


For a XXL it was small since I wear a xl. Did like the fabric.


cute style, well-priced, but skimpy cut.


Tight in the bodice, fits in the waist.


Awesome.Flattering not revealing.  Love it.


This dress is super cute. I love it. However, it is tight across the bust for me. I ordered XL. (Normally I wear size 10 or Large in a dress. I am 5'7", 140#, Bust 43". I am ordering the next size up.


 I ordered and received a size XXL. It fits beautifully. The entire dress has stretch. Can't wait to wear this dress  out to dinner.


it was too small but the vendor sent out a larger size and it fits fine.


Too small not even close to the size that it is suppose to be


Excellent material, fits perfectly, looks great!!


I love the dress however it doesn't fit. :(
