It fit great! I'm a curvy 5'11" and it wasn't too short, it hit right above the knee. It's really comfortable because it has a little bit of stretch. It accentuated all the right spots.


This is a beautiful well-made dress the only downside is its a little too tight on the top if your busty like I am. I ordered a large  and still quite snug


Nice quality. But runs very small. If you are busty please by larger size


I love the pattern and the cut of the dress however, it was damaged when I received it and I had to send it back.


Love it


Very pretty dress. It looks great on my teenage daughter.


Pretty dress but the sizing is completely wrong.  I ordered a 3x and it is about the size 12


Honestly you can't beat this dress for the price.  It fits a little long for a petite person but that isn't exactly a negative for the product.  The pattern and cut are as advertised and it fits my bust/waist like a glove.  My only issue is the fabric is a bit low quality and doesn't flow as I'd like.  FYI I bought a small and am 4'11", 112 lbs.


Dress fit great, but 2-3 inches of the zipper near the waist were not attached. I returned it and ordered a new one. The replacement arrived horribly wrinkled and had an unfortunate random brown stem/twig/something in the middle of the green part of the chest.


Like others, I got so many compliments.  The guy really like it.  I got a size medium and it fit just right.  Others my size, says size up but I am glad I did not.
