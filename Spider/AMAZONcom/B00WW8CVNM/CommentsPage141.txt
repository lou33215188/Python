Beautiful dress! Couldn't be happier! Material is very nice.


Fabric quality, print; length, make and shape of dress; absolutely love everything about this dress!


love the colors, dress is a little too small even though I ordered the size that I wear.


Wore this dress to a wedding, and got so many compliments. Very nice dress!!


Bought this dress and slip to wear to a wedding. Lots of compliments.


The dress, looks EXACTLY as the photo shows. I didn't know, it tied in the back. I'm not a fan, of bows. But, it is a great dress!!! LOVE IT


Love the print and the cut. It arrived a lot faster than expected. It just needs a wash to get rid of the chemical smell.


I had to return it because it flat out didn't fit and I didn't like the material


it look so beautiful  on me .


My daughter loves this dress and it fits her beautifully.
