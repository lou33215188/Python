This dress runs small, so I read the reviews and ordered up. It fit beautifully. I do recommend the petticoat to add volume to the skirt. I actually ironed it, and I never iron. ğŸ˜� I wore it to roller derby, and it was very fitting. I highly recommend this dress!


ADORABLE!  The style of this dress is simply classy.  The fabric is a comfortable cotton.  The fit and length is perfect for work or for a dinner out.  Versatile in that I can put on a jacket, cardigan, heels or flats to change the look.  Love it, am stocking up on other patterns.


If it fit, I'd love it.....nice fabric with a little stretch, pretty colors.  After reading reviews, most people advised to buy one size up, which I did, and it is too big.  I'll return this one and order a large.  (even though the picture is green fabric and says light green, when added to cart it says gray, which turns out to be a light grayish blue, still nice, but not green)


I usually wear a 1X in Tiana B and just about everything else. Not here. I ordered a XXXL because of people saying it ran small. Small is not the word for it !!! It fits like a med in Tiana B I'm going to see if I can return it. The material is FAB !!! Really sorry I couldn't keep it !!! The Colors are beautiful too. Just very , very , very small. Sad.


While this dress has an awesome vintage feel that I love, it wasn't as spectacular as I hoped.  The cut is okay at best, almost has a costume feel to it and it is little longer than I expected, but what really upset me, is that it smells terrible.  Must be the black dye they use or something but yuck. Definitely needs a wash or dry clean before wearing.


I like this dress a lot. It is super classy and beautiful. The skirt isn't as full as it looks but I purchased a petticoat to go underneath it and it makes it look so pretty. I like the way that this dress falls because it falls away from the stomach and gives a nice little shape. It makes me feel pretty to wear.


Really like this dress.  Nice fabric which washed well.  Good value.  Looks great w button cartigan sweater, or jean jacket and boots!  I'm long waisted so sown in belt works perfect.  Dress ties in back so appears 2b more "empress" style waistline on long torso which works, still cute.  Getting 2nd in totally different color/patern.


Pay attention to the size chart by the company and you should be ok.  I purchased a size 1X even though I normally wear a size 14 to 16.  It fit very nicely.  Length is great!.  I'm 5ft 2inches tall and most dresses are way too long for me.  This one goes a little  below my knees.  Since I'm on my 60s, I don't like to wear dresses above the knee anymore.  I get very nice compliments when I wear this dress.


I didn't expect this dress to be as nice as it is for the money it cost. I thought I'd wear it to work, but it is too dressy for that. I am pleasantly suprised by this item and very tempted to order more!


Does not look as it is in the picture and this string to be tied at the back is rediculous as it is suppose to be an aldult dress so it looks childish. The material is good. Looks so much better in the picture but not the same when I receive it
