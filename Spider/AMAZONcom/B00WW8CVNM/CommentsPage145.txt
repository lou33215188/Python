We did not know what to expect with this dress but when it arrived we laughed with glee. It  was gorgeous.


I have gotten so many positive comments when I wear this dress. It fits in all the right places and it looks exactly like the picture. I have bought more of these dresses because I am so happy with the product! I will be buying even more in the future!


True to size. Overall pleased with the dress, cut and fabric. Zipper is a bit finiky, and the bust bows if you are average/smaller chested. Thats the only reason it gets 4/5!


Very cute dress, I received a lot of compliments! It was a thinner material, but you couldn't see through it. I am 5'3" and the size small came down below my knee.


I liked the pattern on the dress, but the dress was simply too small and there was no place to send it back to because it was sent from China!


Love it. And itâ€™s pretty and casual enough to wear to work.


The dress is a perfect fit. I wore it with a petticoat and received so many compliments. The material is a little stretchy and not constrictive. I'm generally a womens 12-14, with a 38DD chest.


I normally wear an XL or 1X. So, when the reviews said that the dress ran small, I got a 3X just to be on the safe side. I wish I would not have played it so safe! Much too large. Only go up 1 size at the most.


CUTE. FUN.


I bought this as a gift for a family member and they enjoy it a lot. Their only complaint is that they don't get as many opportunities to wear it as they would like. I did order a size up.
