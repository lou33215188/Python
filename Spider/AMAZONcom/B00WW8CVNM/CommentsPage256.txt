Perfect summer dress for garden wedding.  It was perfect ! Tons of compliments.


Great dress for  price. Nice cut. Only flaw is the darts in the front bodice are not quite flat. But can be covered with a chunky necklace.


Very small in the bust.


lovely...hope to use the petticoat underneath


Wore this when a group of us attended local theatre presentation of Grease. It was perfect. Tons of complements and soooo fun to wear!


I feel so pretty!


will not return.  Love the dress but way too small....came from China...beware!!!


I looooooove this dress!!! The green colour is so vibrant and it fits a little below the knee. I definitely will buy again!!! I am 5'7' 125 lbs 32A 25 39  . Would definitely recommend it.


very nice dress and good fabric quality.


Love this dress! It is flattering for any body type and you feel a little bit like you've stepped back in time when you're wearing it. My measurements: 145lbs, 5'6". 34ddd, waist 31 in. I bought a large and it was perfect. I almost bought a medium and it probably would have been ok but maybe a little snug. The large fit me well (especially since I'm bigger in the chest area!). It's also pretty comfortable :)
