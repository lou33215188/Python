I was so impressed with the quality and great price on the dress. I'll be using it for a 1950's outfit. I added a petticoat to fill out the skirt. What a great deal!


It is a bit snug but still wearable I love how it flows looks awesome with a peticoat


Pretty dress, but no cleaning instructions included


This dress is SO adorable. I love the way it fits BUT I read lots of reviews that said it runs a little big and they are definitely right. So I got a size smaller than I would usually get and it it fits perfectly.


Great dress! I ended up getting this in 3 colors. Note that it arrives super wrinkled. Also, the neck is a bit high.


My wife's decision for her mother.


another pretty  vintage dress to add to casual collection. Purple color and other color prints make it easy to coordinate and be versatile with other things already have in closet. Stylish with todays trending look.


Excellent quality!! I love the fit and the material it's made of!! Great purchase! If you're on the fence because of poor reviews, I'd just like to say it's beyond my expectations! Beautiful dress! Perfect fit!


IT'S A PRETTY DRESS BUT IT DOES NOT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS PICTURE ONLINE...THE MATERIAL IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I WAS EXPECTING....BUT THIS DRESS US SO BEAUTIFUL!


I am 5'7.5, 140 lbs and wear size 8 in dresses. I bought a medium and it fit perfectly. The length is truly Midi length, the material is comfortable and beautiful. Overall the dress is beautiful and I love it. Planning to buy more colors.
