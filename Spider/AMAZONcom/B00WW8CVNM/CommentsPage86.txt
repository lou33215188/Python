Love the fabric but the dress was cut differently than the same style in a different fabric. The one that did fit, I had to have quite a few alterations done to make it fit properly.


It's good material. I had a hard time getting the right size. I finally ordered a size xlarge & it fit perfect. I wear a size 12 exactly. Asian sizes ared for me one size up. I finally got the red & black & love it.


I love this dress. The colors are amazing. The blue colors really stand out. I wore it to my sister's wedding. Strong material very great ESP the price.


I love this dress, I followed the sizing chart and it fits perfectly. It is very flattering to my figure as well the fabric seems quite sturdy, though I haven't tried to wash it yet. It definitely adds something to wear a petticoat underneath!!


Very cute! It's a little loose up top, but then again I'm 5'11" and built like a washboard, so I think it just needs a flattering bra for me. Already did as other reviewers suggested and ordered a petticoat to give it that nice flare. Note that this thing has TONS of pleats, so cleaning it professionally is probably the only option.


Great fit. I cannot wait to wear it. It is hit or miss ordering dresses like this online but with the previous reviews I decided to take a chance and I am glad I did. It fits perfectly.


It's a pretty dress!!


It was only 20 bucks..great value for that price! Everyone loved it and thought it could def be worn to other events (not just a 50s party)  It was a tiny bit snug for a medium.  pressed up nice.  Wore it with the petticoat/crinoline.


I got a ton of compliments in this dress.  It's well made great fabric and just lovely.  I plan to order more from this company.  Beautiful fit.  Fast shipping too!


I wear a 2x. it fit great everywhere.. but... couldnt zip up because of could zip past breast area. I wear DD.. so disappointed, it was beautiful dress
