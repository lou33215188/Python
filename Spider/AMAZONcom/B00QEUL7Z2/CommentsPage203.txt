I think these dresses are very well made and I love the fabric very happy with the purchas


Great dress git lots if complaints runs smaller so I order one size up.


The fit was fine and it looked good on but the fabric was kind of boring, a plain off white.


Was more than surprised by the quality of this garment. One thing it does not mention which was a plus, this material has a stretch to it.


Light sea green came darker then what I expected, but still a beautiful dress and fits great!!


GREAT DRESS!!


I Adore this dress! It fits perfectly! It has some "give" in the bodice so it will fit women with a larger bust line. This dress will faltter all figures.


This is a beautifully cut dress. It was very flattering for my fifteen year old daughter. She received many compliments on her homecoming dress.


This dress fit perfectly. The bodice has a somewhat stretchy material,so there is some "give" to it. I suggest getting the petticoat to make it look even better.


Fit well. Nice material
