This dress is amazing. It fits perfectly and it is just the right length. I needed something modest for a black tie dinner and it fits the bill. :)


I love this dress. It fits me perfectly showing my hourglass figure and it looks so lovely on me.


Love this 50s style dress. Very fun! Super comfy. Fits perfectly, as expected by size.


I could have gotten a smaller size. I like for my clothes to fit a little snug.  The material has some stretch to it.  But otherwise I like the dress


Lovely dress that is stretchy yet fitted at the same time. The shape of the bust is flattering and not too revealing.


Awesome dress!
