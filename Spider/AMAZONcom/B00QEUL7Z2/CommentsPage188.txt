EXCELLENT FABRIC AND  FIT.  FUN DRESS TO WEAR.


Lovely dress. Fits perfect and the green dress is actually that perfect dark green. Material is a little stretchy so order your exact size.


Really think it is pretty and flattering. The chest area has room even if you are busty. I also think it is comfortable.


Very pretty, but I think almost too formal for the event I'm going to.  It comes to mid-calf and they are joking when they say Audrey Hepburn-like.  Glamorous.


I'm 4'11 and Small is still big for me... I returned it.


loved it.


What a beautiful, flattering, and modest dress! The material is very comfortable/can stretch in the middle. I am 5'7/120 pounds and the small fits like a dream. It goes about 3 inches below my knee as well. I suggest anyone around this range of height and weight order a small.


Love the fit


Did not like the material.


GREAT COLOR.. WILL WEAR OFTEN
