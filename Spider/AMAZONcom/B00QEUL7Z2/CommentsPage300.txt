Love it!!! Orderd a blue one and it was different fabric and didn't fit.


Not true to size. Could not wear.


Wasn't what I expected either.


It's more like a costume or a bridesmaid dress from the 1980s. Made well just not what I need for this occasion.


Not for me


I bought this for Halloween to dress up as Belle and it was perfect!


I wish I could give this dress zero stars, I do not understand ANY of the 5 star reviews. The dress I received is literally garbage, it is HORRIBLY constructed, every single seam of the dress looks like it is about to burst open. It is like Amazon sent me a dress someone 4 sizes too big squeezed into and then sent back, every seam of the dress is loose and coming a part, and there are loose threads all over the thing. The pleats on the bodice are absolutely horrendous and I don't know how to fix them because you can't iron this dress.Not to mention the dress looks cheap and nothing like the picture, the sleeves aren't even remotely them same. I bought this because the bridesmaid dress I ordered never came in and the wedding is next month... now I have to find a whole new dress because there is no way I can wear this one, it is ripped and falling apart... this is the WORST purchase I have ever made on Amazon. DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS FOR ANY FORMAL EVENT. It looks so awful and cheap and you will just be completely embarrassed. I have bought better looking dresses for 12 dollars at wal-mart. This is not worth the money at all. Period.


I ordered this for a bridesmaid dress for my friends wedding- was worried that it wouldn't be "fancy" enough. It arrived on time, and to my delight is a LOVELY quality dress. I ordered my normal size 6/Medium, and it fits wonderfully. It is so comfortable. I am definitely going to order more in other colors! :)
