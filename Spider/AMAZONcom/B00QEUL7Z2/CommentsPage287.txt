Exchanged for a larger size. Bridesmaids looked great in our semi-rockabilly wedding!! Figure flattering for all body shapes.


Love this dress! Super cute. Don't know long it will last, as it is cheaply made, but for the price it is worth it!


I just received my dress, it was an emergency dress and I was keeping my fingers crossed.  It fits like a dream and it is beautiful, I'm glad I ordered a petty coat. I hope i am worried about ironing it so give yourself plenty of time to get it professionally done.  If anyone has ironed it let me know.  I'm ordering another couple of color's my new favorite.


Loved the dress and was looking gorgeous . One thing is the sizing. Although the dress fits me perfectly but I ordered US 8 which should be equal to 12 UK (my usual size), I found the size on the dress saying its US 8 and UK 10!


Not sure which one is right but the it was ok for me. I think I read a review saying the same thing here


I never received the mesh skirt ğŸ˜� please check into where it is.


The dress is great I love it


Beautiful dress. It fit like a glove and I got so many compliments. If you are between 2 sizes, I recommend going with the smaller size. That's what I did and it fit my ample bosom nicely. I also recommend getting a crinoline. It's pretty without, but more swingy with.


color is a beautiful red, fits nicely, I Got a Medium size, I am 34 DD and fit just perfect!!!


This dress fits perfectly. I purchased the bright yellow dress for an upcoming charity event in June. The color is just as I expected. I can't wait to wear this!


wore this in a wedding. it fit as expected via the size chart. cute, 50's style.


Fabric kinda feels like plastic.  I'll deal with just the one but I will remove the others I had on my wish list.
