A bit too big for me. I ordered a size Medium but it was way too big for my size. I would need an extra small next time based on this experience. The fabric's pretty nice though and it's comfortable on the skin.


This dress is unbelievable fits like a glove.


These dresses were perfect for my bridesmaids! Looked beautiful on each one.


This dress was GREAT! It's a little past my knees which is perfect. The material is super stretchy and very comfortable. I put a petticoat underneath it and it looks even more classy. I got the green, which is very bright but still looks great. Would buy again in a heart beat.


this dress is perfect


Just got mine in. Love the color teal. I was worried about the length since I'm 5ft it's perfect for me. It fits well the zipper is smooth. Would recommend this.


Love this dress very sexy fits wonderful,,,i never really order clothes off line,but I'm glad i ordered this dress...


I purchased two of these beautiful dresses,Yellow and Red Turquoise Floral, the fit is amazing ! Brings out all the curves..so pleased ,I am still smiling. I have decided to make another purchase.. Thank You MUXXN !


The material is of great quality..I usually go for Large size but after reading reviews i ordered Medium...yet it is bit loose for me because of the strechable material. Its ideal for office wear. Nice flair.


Ordered my dress on Friday (9/9/16) & received it today (9/15/16) for a wedding on the 17th! (Great delivery timing!) I ordered a 3XL Just to be on the safe size. I'm a very busty woman as well & the dress fit perfectly!! The color was the exact one I needed! Love it!! Thank you!
