The only bad thing I can say abt this dress is that its just a little too long.. I bought a petticoat for under n I really wish u could see just a tiny bit peeking out... Maybe i shouldve bought a size smaller, considering its got a good stetch to it..? Other than that, it really did fit well. Which is always a huge relief buying clothing off the internet. It also was delivered  quickly.  All in all, a good buy. Would def recommend to others. (:


It fit as expected, however, the seam around the waist did not look good; so it was returned.  If it was seamless, it would have been a perfect dresss.


Cheap fabric. Zipper broke while trying it on.


Stretchy and fun. You can tell its lower quality stitching but most people can't tell. It was fun and I received a lot of compliments. I'm 5"5', 190 and a 36F and wear and size 12 typically. The large fit me like a glove.


I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this dress for the price. The material is nice and the dress is flattering. Fits pretty well, but a little large in the bust.


It was too small.  However, it made go on a diet, so maybe, I will purchase later for another event.


The color was nothing like the picture.  Rather than a soft peach color it was a dark orangy color.  Not what I was looking for.


My wife loved it. Just don't iron it, she made that mistake. It fits perfect and is really cute.


Better than expected for the price. I was worried about it being to small, but the material is stretchy and doesn't look cheap. I bought this for my Halloween costume, but may wear it and buy another for normal days. Love!


This dress was way too hot. Be aware that the material of the dress is extremely heavy like a curtain. Not lined and VERY busy in the front. Stretchy material and big on me. I ordered a small and I am 5'2 at 125 pounds.  Waist fit but chest way too big and I am a 34 double D in a Victoria Secret bra and measurement.
