It was true to size for me. Fit perfectly. I bought a petticoat along with the dress, but honestly you dont have to. The dress itself looks great. The shipping was fast. I'm looking forward to purchasing another dress.


True to size.  Fits well.  Only thing is it doesn't come with cleaning instructions


Very impressed with the quality a little big but ordered it with that intention.


Really  cute dress nice fabric.i bought a puffy slip to wear under it.


Love the dress. I have it in 3 different colors!!


Despite the dress being slightly large on me, I absolutely love it. It is gorgeous and very flattering. As some of the other reviews have said, the dress is indeed very stretchy and I recommend ordering a size down.


The dress is pretty and looks as expected. If you are size 0-2 DO NOT get this dress. It will be too large on you, especially if you have a small bust.


Bought this for graduation and looked spectacular! Love the quality and the comfort!


Very pretty dress! The material is nice and keeps it fancy enough to wear to my friends wedding. A size small can fit snug on me sometimes, but this dress zipped up with ease and fits so comfortably.


Order up a size. My daughter wears a size 14 and I bought her the XL and it fits her perfect! This dress is just wonderful and the price is perfect:) Highly recommend and going to purchase again:)
