Although I don't wear dresses, I bought it for a formal but not fancy occasion. It fitted perfectly.


Excellent


So cute and fits perfectly. I wear a 16 and ordered an XL, and it was perfect. It had a weird smell to it so I had to get it dry cleaned right away.


I purchased this dress to be Belle from Beauty and the Beast for Halloween....and it was PERFECT. It does run a bit small so make sure to order your next size up or even 2 sizes up. It does stretch a bit; I am usually a large so I ordered an XL and it fit well but almost too well.


Rating is only for the color. Fit was beautiful but color WAS NOT WHITE. Came in as an off-white/cream. Would order in a different color for an occasion I didn't need white for. Will be returning.


Love this dress! The fit was perfect, I ordered it according to the size chart. The seams and zipper, overall construction of the dress is well made.


Awesome dress!  Fits perfectly, so comfy...not a dress person, but this dress rocks!  I bought it for a retro event, but will keep it to wear for other occasions (minus the crinoline).


I love the dress, but it is not made for the average American  woman with Kim Kardashian's and most African American women's butt's.


I wanted to give it five stars but the color is more of a muted lemon rather than bright yellow.


Perfect fit! Love the look, paired it with leopard cole haan shoes and a chunkie necklace!
