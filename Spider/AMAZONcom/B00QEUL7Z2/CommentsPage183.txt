love this./


I'm very happy with this dress. I'm so happy I have a red one  on order :) The size chart was very accurate.


Nice stretchy fabric, though it does seem a little cheap. No surprises, good value for price and pretty flattering overall. I'm a size 16 with large bust and this nicely covers all i feel it needs to.


The dress fits great, the material is nice and it is flattering to the figure, made nicely, easy care, the color is vibrant


Beautiful but too small for me. I need to send it back


Perfect! Kind of stretchy, so it fits really well!


Love this dress.  Nice fabric and styling.  I purchased a medium and had to return it and get a small. I think it runs a big large.  (I usually wear a size 8.)


the purchase was perfect


This dress is beautiful and fits absolutely wonderfully. It is so comfortable. I got a lot of compliments while wearing it to a wedding.  I highly recommend.


The review should be 3.5 stars. Start with positive: fits good, true to size, has enough elastane to stretch about 15% in all directions. Color is true to how it's depicted on amazon.  However, dress is 30% cotton, 65% rayon and 5% elastane. For the dress that has so much synthetic you at least hope it's wrinkle-free or doesn't wrinkle easily. Not so - wrinkles quite easily and on pattern-free fabric it's quite noticeable.  Basically, you sit down= wrinkes, you wear seatbelt in a car= wrinkles. Also, imho, for this much synthetic in a dress it's overpriced.  But compared to 3 other dresses that I bought from amazon within a year, the fit is the best and the most true to size, so I'm keeping it. Lots of ironing in the future....
