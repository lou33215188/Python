I like the style of the top of this dress but the material is too stiff, almost like heavy swimsuit material, for the bottom part to hang nicely.  I felt way too hippy and I'm 5'8 and 135.  I missed the cut-off to send it back :(


Very pretty and saucy... However, not for a middle age to older woman...has an attached petticoat slip crittling under the lining that appears at the bottom of the dress.


Adorable and sophisticated at the same time. I am enjoying wearing it very much.  The only down side is that zipper sticks. This makes getting the dress on somewhat difficult by yourself.  The zipper is probably not the best quality.


I bought a medium and it was a bit too big, so I reordered a small and it fits great, very cute dress, got to wear to a wedding, I usually wear a size 6 in dresses


I'm a size 8/10, and read that this dress ran a little large, so I ordered a medium instead of a large. The medium was STILL quite big on me, so I returned and ordered a small. Fits much better, but even so, still a bit large.


Stretchy material makes it larger. I kept a small eventhough I'm a medium


I love this dress, fits perfect, and is absolutely lovely. Wonderful price!


This beautiful dress was a gift for my daughter. True to size. She is very happy with the dress and has received many compliments.


Wonderful. feels great & looks wonderful.


Beautiful dress! Fits exactly to my size.
