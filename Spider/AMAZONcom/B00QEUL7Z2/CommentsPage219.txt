I used this for my college graduation.  It fit like I thought it would.  Be careful with washing, it will shrink some.


Best dress I've ever owned. I'm saving for every color!


Love, love this dress!  The fabric is so comfy. A great dress for a wedding or if you are to dance the night away.


Absolutely gorgeous. I have an extra small


I was excited when this dress came and it fit perfectly.


I'm not sure if I received the same dress as everyone else because mine didn't look like the picture. The pic shows a short sleeve but mine hardly had any sleeves at all- looked closer to a tank top. Also the bottom skirt has a seam down the center which is an unusual spot. It made a fold when I wore it. Decided to return. I took a picture of the dress but not able to  post it.


My wife is sexy in this and great fit. Old charm , fine fit !


Cute dress. Fits fairly well, although ran just a tad large


Beautiful! Made me feel very glamorous and a little retro. This dress is perfect for curvy gals! Sizing was perfect.


The dress arrived on time, perfect fit for my daughter.
