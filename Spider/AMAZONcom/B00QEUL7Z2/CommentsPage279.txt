I like the dress


Truly perfect fit. I love it.


I was nervous that it wouldn't fit but it fits like a dream


The quality of sewing could be a little bit better.


I love the color and design. I'm not 100% thrilled with the chest pattern, one side isn't as defined and if you dont pushed the fabric down the right way over your bra, it makes it look pointy... you know where I'm talking about... It's on the medium side of small... but still fits well enough that I'll keep it!


looks great


YAA!!! I really like this dress!


Great fabric and very comfortably


This dress is gorgeous and seems to be high quality (only worn once yet).  I ordered a 2x and I definitely could have gone with just a 1x, there is quite a bit of stretch. Looks okay without a petticoat, but definitely looks better with one!


Love
