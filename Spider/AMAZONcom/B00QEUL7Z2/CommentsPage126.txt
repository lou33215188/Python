I read reviews so ordered a size larger - perfect fit! It has a zipper but I don't even use it ... Just slips easily over my head. Ordered the green & purple, get compliments on both. Thank you!


My go-to black dress- fits great and looks amazing!


I haven't worn it yet b/c i'm waiting on the underskirt, but the fit otherwise is great.  it's a slightly stretchy breathable material & it hits me @ about calf length right now.  I'm 5'4" if that helps.  ordered a Med for the 'girls' @ a 34DD.  Looking forward to wearing it!


I was very impressed by the quality of the heavy and slightly stretchy fabric. The cut didn't particularly flatter my figure so I returned it, but it was a beautiful shade of Kelly green and was very comfortable.


I am 5'3 & 120lbs and I ordered a small and this dress fit me perfectly. I love everything about it right down to the feel of the fabric! Definitely happy about this purchase.


nice color, nice material, not too low. Love the little sheer detail at the bottom. Well made.


This color of the dress was on sale and I love it!  Inexpensive material so not great to the touch, but it has just the right amount of stretch to fit perfectly.  The shirring in the front should have been tacked down to make it lay right for a bigger bust but I'll fix that.


Wore this dress to a classic car show and  was surprised at how much positive attention I got wearing it.  Great fit and flattering.


Amazing!!! I thought it would be too small, I ordered a larger size then I received but the material stretches without being tight. Looks amazing on too. Zipper is somewhat sketchy.


This is an absolutely beautiful dress, and it fit very well. I felt gorgeous and old fashioned. I also loved how it was a great length for me, even at 5'10". Now I want it in multiple colours! Would absolutely recommend.
