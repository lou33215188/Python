LOVE IT! I am 27 years old. I weigh 215lbs. Im 5'6". Size 18  to 22. 42DDD. I ordered a XX-Large and it fits me perfectly in every area.


Vibrant color and I love the lace on the bottom! I bought this as a bridesmaid dress and I am pleased with my purchase!


Well my dress just arrived on time. It was ordered for my party in 2 days so I was super happy it got here. When I opened the package it was the wrong color. I love the dress but so so so sad it's the wrong color.


The quality is good and the fit is close. Just a little big.


Fit as expected but fabric is not comfortable.


Perfect, perfect, perfect! I could not ask for


 A better fitting, more beautiful dress if I had it made for my daughter.


Love this dress! I ordered my usual size and the fit is great, material feels good.  I love the yellow lace around the tail.  I needed a black and yellow combination, so I ordered a black skirt to go underneath, added just the right touch of fullness for my tea party! Received it in less than a week. Would definitely recommend it!


she looks wonderfull


Great dress for the price. The material is nice, a little stretchy. It fits perfectly. It is for an outdoors wedding, I am a bridesmaid. I would actually wear this dress again! Very happy!!!


GREAT DRESS!! Retro-ish yet modern look, WONDERFUL forgiving material!! I ordered a size smaller and worked out GREAT!!


This fits great.  I used the chart to find my size and it worked out perfectly.  I used the Tidetell  Vintage 50's Rockabilly Crinoline Tutu with it.  It adds so much to the overall affect of the dress.  I purchased it in Navy and loved it.
