I just received my dress in black, and loved it so much I ordered the red dress also.  I ordered a small, I am 5' 7" and wear a size 6, and it fit perfectly.  I would also like to add that by no means are they cap sleeves.  Actually there are no sleeves but that doesn't bother me at all.  The dress is beautiful and very well made, love the material, just strecthy enough.  Would recommend to everyone.  Am going to wear the red one for Valentines Day. Make sure you order your regular size as it does not run big.


Cute


Love when reviewers give height and weight to help with size. I am 5' 5 1/2" and weight 198 got size 12 perfect, hope this helps, OK have to edit can't get zipper up past the waist when on.  Zips great on hanger but when on won't zip past stitching in waist now changing stars to one


Fits great, looks adorable on. Can't wait to wear it out.
