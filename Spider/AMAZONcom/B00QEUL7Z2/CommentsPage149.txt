A little tighter than expected at the waist for the size, but wearable.  You might want to go up a size. Very happy with the product.


I LOVE this dress. It fits so well! The material is good quality, not like those cheapo dresses that you can buy online. I love the flare! The burgundy color was true to the photo.


WAY too small


I liked it, but I didn't realize the style with the crossed fabric over the chest would require a larger bust. Wonderful fabric & styling, but it just wasn't the right style to flatter my shape.


This dress is perfect. Fits well, comfortable, great price!


I love this dress! I want one in red now! I got so many compliments. I paired it up with a red crinoline and it looked amazing. I sized down due to reviews and glad I did. Fit great!


Don't think just buy. This dress is beautiful on. It is flowy and spins and is nice stretchy type fabric. It is made well too. I hesitated on if I wanted to. I bought the large in black. My size is slightly larger but the large fits beautiful this dress runs on the larger size. Im gonna buy another one.


Adorable retro look!


I wore this dress to my pastor's 25 anniversary banquet.  I already felt lovely in it, but as the compliments poured in, it was like icing on the cake! Very classy! The dress fit very nicely! The stretch material was a plus!


I LOVE this dress!  It fits perfectly.  I am very curvy and the stretch makes this dress so comfortable to wear because it fits just right on all my curves!
