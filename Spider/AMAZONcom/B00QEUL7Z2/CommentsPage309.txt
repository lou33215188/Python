I recommend wearing heels with it so you will look like a model. This dress is great!


Bought this in red for my daughter.she absolutely loves it and is thrilled with it.


I was so disappointed in the dress. I bought this dress to wear to s wedding snd the zipper was so flimsy it BROKE it the wedding. Thank goodness my friend had a sweater I could slip on and leave before anyone saw my whole back side!!n


My friends and I decided to have a little fun and have a little vintage tea party. I bought this dress because I love the whole look and I like that I had a lot of design options to choose from. The fabric is soft and the stitching on these are really good. The dress fits me just right and I'm very happy I bought these.


I'm 5'5 weigh 148lbs and ordered the dress size Medium. This dress was way too big! Plus the dress isn't flowy like the picture. It looks like one of those cheap dresses that get stained or burnt easily with the iron so upset with this order


I bought this one for our vintage party last mother's day. It signifies simplicity and feminism. I love it because it's very elegant! Im glad I got the right size. I will definitely be wearing this one again for future parties :)


Nice dress, its so classy and very decent. This just proves that I don't have to show off everything just to be gorgeous


Super cute and really nice quality! Fit perfect!


Very pretty dress. Wanted to buy one for a long time now and now that I've seen and felt how comfy it is, it made me wanna buy more!


Super cute, came in the exact color of green that the picture looks like on my computer. However it truly DOES run large. I got an XL which is recommended size for 14-16 and I definitely would have been fine in the L. Really flattering dress though. :)
