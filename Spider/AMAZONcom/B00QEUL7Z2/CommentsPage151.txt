Nice item for the price.  nice full skirt!


I tried on the dress and it fit well. It was long as many people pointed out but not an issue. My huge issue was I had a really bad  allergic reaction. I am going to get it dry cleaned and hope for the best.


very nice and looks great


Was too long for me, but fit very well otherwise. I'm 5'4", 140 with G chest... I was pleasantly surprised it had enough room for my bust ( barely). Was worn on a very warm summer day and didn't feel too warm.


Love this dress. Material is thinner than expected, but very stretchy. I give it 4 stars because the material is so thin. You will need a slip. But if you are well endowed, order your waist size and the top will stretch.


I was hesitate to purchase a dress online, however it fits very well and the color is great. The delivery was on time.


I ordered a medium thinking it would be Stop Staring sizes... It is not.It is even too big for my friend who wears a medium!


Amazing dress. Order your size. The material stretches and it feels really good.


Its stretchy material. Bought for daughters bridesmaid dress . Good quality. Delivered in 3 days


Wish it were not dry clean only. Very heavy but cure as can be. True to color and size. Long...I am 5'11" and it hits under my knees!
