I got the green plaid. Its absolutely great, looking forward to wearing it for the holidays!


I absolutely love this dress. The material is heavy and somewhat stretchy. Comfortable.  I ordered a large and I'm 5'5" and 150lbs, 38c/d and it fits perfect. I would also recommend the 26in petticoat.


Nice dress, flattering and versatile.


So excited to wear this dress...it's perfect!


Nice quality material, does stretch. I am usually too big for 6s and too small for 8s, but this actually fits well. If you are smaller chested you not fill it out as well, but it fits well at the hips.


Dress did not look to be very well made and the fit did not flatter me (the fit is obviously my own issue.) I returned it.


It is a lot heavier then I thought it would be but it also hides all the spots you don't want showing! I would buy a size larger.


Love perfect size  like it was made for me.


Ridiculously stretchy.


Super cute
