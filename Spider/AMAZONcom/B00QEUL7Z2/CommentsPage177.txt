Very well made and comfortable.  Looks very nice on.


The dress in the picture is white but the actual dress is off white/cream.  Very disappointed ! Bust is a couple inches bigger than a normal medium.


Bought this for my wife and she is very very happy with it which makes me very happy  :)


I am 5'7", 150 lbs, and wear a large in shirts. I read this dress was stretchy, so I ordered a medium. It fit perfectly. Could not be happier.


I LOVE the styling, feel, and fit!  I got a size large and I am pretty athletic 5'10", 170lbs. It will be so fun to wear this - anywhere!  It is a great buy!


Bought this for my mom and she is in love with it. I on the other hand dont like how the design at the front doesnt stay in place i had to iron it 3 times... Good buy though came earlier than i expected.


Color was difficult to tell, and is not as beautiful as in the picture. Cut is fantastic and would go a bit smaller than I expected in a different color.


Love this dress! It's stretchy material is awesome, I always worry about ordering dresses online, because I never know if it will fit in my waist. I ordered two more in different colors! Nothing but compliments from everyone when I wear these dresses!


Good for the price


a litter small around waist. but over all I love the dress. I got a lot of comment on how good it looked on me.


you need a small waist line for this dress.
