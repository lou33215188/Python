Very cute, a little more casual style of a dress than I thought, little small at the sleeves & shoulders but flattering on waist


Dress was very nice and fit nicely.


Thanks


Really liked the retro design but the fabric is a bit too firm.


Wow, this dress is beautiful. I agree that you can order a slightly smaller size per other reviewers advice.


My daughter is 12 and she loves this vintage style dress.  Perfect for any occasion, and even for Sunday!


Just arrived today! Love the fit and color. So tempted to order in another color.


It's beautiful and fancy, the chest area is a bit wide even in the smallest size


When I wear this I constantly get compliments.  Use an additional petticoat for a better look.


24 waist 33 bust and is too large. The dress went down mid shin. I am 5 '5 and 110lbs.


Wonderful dress
