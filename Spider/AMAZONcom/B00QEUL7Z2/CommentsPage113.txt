Really pretty and fits decently, just a little too much fabric in the hip area - having it adjusted. The fabric is also rather heavy. But overall I'm pretty happy with it.


I'm a 38DD with a 33 inch waist and a large fits perfectly.  There is some stretch, but it holds its shape.  And at 5' 6" it hits right below the knee.  The fabric is not the greatest to the touch.  It's more durable than luxurious.  Excellent for a party girl who maybe spills on herself from time to time.  Fabric aside, I love it and bought it in two colors.


Order one size up.


Love the classic style and great fit. The pattern of the fabric is very true to the retro design. Add the petticoat tutu and you're set for a great retro look and feel.


Much nicer material than I thought it would be. Only negative is that you can only hand wash and it says not to put in the drier.


I didn't get the right dress and had to return it and now apparently have to rebuy and  pray I get the right one.


Delivered on time, fits perfectly, but brighter than expected. It's not a wine red, it's just straight red. It's fine for the wedding I'm attending, and I still love it, I just wish it was the color I ordered. Regardless, it's lovely and definitely a steal quality wise for the price.


Beautiful quality dress! I had to return is as the length was too long for me. Amazon makes the return process so easy though.


Wonderful dress!  I was a little unsure about buying it online without trying it on first, but the reviews left by others helped me pick the right size and it fit perfectly!  I loved it and coupled with a sequin gold shawl/scarf I received so many compliments through the night.


Usually a size 10-12 in dresses. Because of the stretchy material, Medium for perfectly!
