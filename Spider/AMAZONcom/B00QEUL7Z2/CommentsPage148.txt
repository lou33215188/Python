Such a classy dress! The sweetheart neckline is very flattering, even for big chested girls like myself. the dress was super comfy, however, it lies a bit flat unless you were a petticoat underneath.


Slightly heavy fabric but love the fit


This dress is so awesome!  I wasn't expecting it to be so perfect! It is just darling and I'm thrilled w it!


Love the dress, had to trim 3.5 inches off the bottom--I'm short but looked awesome for the wedding.


Love ,Love, Love, this dress !!! Fits perfect, great length. Im 5'2', 130lbs I ordered a small and it was on point.


Somewhat small, Suppose to be a XL and I would label it a Medium. Still fits. Ok so far I haven't but tried it on, not worn it for a whole day.


This is the bomb.  The material is thick and drapey, unlike some of the other options out there.  The color is exactly as portrayed, and I wouldn't call this "beige" but "peach."


Beautiful dress and it fits nicely.


I can hardly wait for the event for which I purchased this dress.  It fits so nicely, even hides my tummy so well I won't have to do the suck-it-in thing all night!


LOVE this dress... very Audrey Hepburn!  Very flattering.
