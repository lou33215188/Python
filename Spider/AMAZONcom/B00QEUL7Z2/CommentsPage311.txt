My wife looks awesome in this.


Loved it, fit perfectly.  Loose threads here and there but not that big a deal.  Lost a star because it wreaks of cigarette smoke!  I really hope the smell comes out, it's that bad.


It stretches too much, doesn't hold a nice shape. Returning this product I think.


The green dress is just so interesting, its very unusual of me wearing it but I totally love it


Got this dress as a birthday gift- it fits perfectly, and it looks even better in person!


I can't wait to wear this lovely vintage dress on Valentine's.


Didn't like the material.


Gorgeous Dress!!!! The material is fantastic and the stitching is superior quality!


The quality and cut is nice. The fit just isn't right.


Beautiful color, nice look, runs 2 sizes to small.ğŸ˜­
