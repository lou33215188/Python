Great dress!


great quality was greatly impressed!


The shoulders are a bit large on me, but the rest fits just great. Now I need to find somewhere to put it on!


Lovely dress.


Good dress, got it for a wedding as a braidsmaid. Little longer than I thought but I wouldn't have gotten it by my choice.


the fit was perfect and the style is flattering...thank you....


Absolutely beautiful dress!! Great fit and material. Beautiful red color. Will be buying another one in another color.


very pleased.


Very fun vintage and classic style black dress. Great to wear for performances.


I love the material and it does fit me very well! Love it!!!
