ordered this dress for upcoming vacation, as the dinner service requires a certain attire.  I read the reviews for sizing and took that into account but still quite large.  I am a definite medium top, small waist and a large/extra large bottom. This was so big on the chest and hips.  The description was listed as beige but it was definitely a melon shade of pink.  It wasn't what the color description stated but it was lovely.  The fabric was very nice and smooth also.


Sadly this is going back because of sizing but also the zipper was poorly sewn, mostly unraveled at the bottom.  The price difference for the next size down is about $30 more, so I won't be swapping out.


I am only giving 4 stars because the dress runs somewhat big. This dress has a stretchy material. But that does not change the look of the dress! It's still very pretty! I am thinking about exchanging for a medium instead of a large though. I am 5'7 180lbs with a 38DDD bust and the large is sllllightly too stretchy in some spots for me. And the dress does go past my knees.


Very beautiful dress. I'm 5'6, around 140 lbs, and a 34C in bras though I wore one of those 'add two cup sizes' type push up bras with this. I tend to be a 2 or 4 in women's clothing, so I guess according to their chart I should have gotten an extra small (I didn't measure my dimensions), but I planned on wearing it to a wedding the day after it arrived and I didn't want to risk it being too tight. I'm also generally a small so I was pretty reluctant to purchase an extra small.


Anyways, it was on the bigger side, but it still fit well. An XS probably would have fit more snugly, but it still looked lovely. It's also made of stretchy material so I would recommend leaning towards a smaller size if you're unsure. The dress hit right below my knee. It was very flattering. I'm not very big, but it was still nice to wear a dress where I could eat a bunch of wedding food and drink a bunch of beer and still look good.


I think it's a great dress for any occasion where you have to dress nice. It's a really good deal considering the cost too. Highly recommend.


I absolutely love this dress. It fit as expected. I am generally a medium (sized somewhere between a U.S. 6 and 8 for most brands), ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. I bought it in the green and while it is a pretty color, it is not quite as pictured. The material is heavy and definitely does not feel "cheap". I wear it with a petticoat for that extra bit of flare. Loved it so much I just purchased it in another color.


Awesome dress!!! I ordered for my daughter, she's 5'6", weighs appx. 145 lbs. and it dts her like a glove. Well made dress. I liked it so much I ordered the XL in black with the crinoline slips. And we're going out to dinner as "twinsies", tomorrow night. The material is super soft and comfortable. However, I will have mine dry-cleaned, bwcuse I don't ant it to shrink. We're really getting into the '50's look. And we'll be buying more dresses like these from Muxxn. ğŸ˜Š Thank you so much!! Foxfire


I was skeptical to purchase because I just tried a dress purchase last week which ended with a return. This fit perfectly. I was looking for a nice dress that was semi conservative (I plan to add a linen shrug/scarf to cover the arms), and this is form fitting yet doesn't expose cleavage. I'm slightly top heavy so that was important to me. The fit was good,  and I had measured myself before ordering to make sure. The material is a little stretchy.


I had some zipper trouble, but because of the stretchiness...  I twisted it around to the front and zipped it as far as I could, twisted it back and put my arms back inside. Then I had a little help finishing the zip at the very top. I'm not sure how to fix this...  Perhaps adding yarn to the zipper to pull it up myself...  But the only negative I find is to zip and unzip, you will need help from someone.


Beautiful. Just what I was looking for.


I was so happy with the quality and fit of this dress that I have ordered two more! I have a hard time finding dresses that fit my chest and flatter without showing too much cleavage, and this was perfect! I wear a 42 F, and usually an 18-20 in dresses. I used the MUXXN size chart and ordered a XXL. I love the way it looks with the crinoline petticoat also! The solid color fabric has enough stretch to make it very comfortable.


A classic dress with retro details. I have become very dubious about online clothing purchases, and did not have high hopes for this dress, especially as the price seemed too good to be true. It does fit well, and seems well made. other reviewers mentioned stitch issues -- this dress seems fine. The color description is off, Its not a "light spring green" as described, but a slightly deeper teal than the photo. The fabric is quite heavy, and not at all sheer. I may buy the petticoat shown beneath the description, to add a little bounce to the skirt. I purchased this for a mid-September wedding, so I think and hope this dress will work for all weather contingencies. All in all, I am pleased.


This dress was purchased for a wedding in which I was the matron of honor, so you can bet I needed it to be spectacular (which it was!). I wore it with a red petticoat and was complimented constantly, all night long. It fit a little large, but the fabric is very flowing and forgiving- no one could tell. I could have gone a size down- may want to do that if you order. The dress came promptly and in perfect condition. No crazy wrinkles like similar rockabilly styles I've purchased from other companies. This is now my go-to dress for everything. It's just gorgeous!


I really loved the dress and the color, it does fit great, my only issue is the sleeves are a bit too narrow, I wish they made them a little ( maybe quarter of an inch or so ) wider, because it's crunching the skin around armpits, and it doesn't look very pleasant. I got the size small and color burgundy. It's true to the posted dimensions, except for the sleeves.
