I love this dress. Bought it for a wedding and got a million compliments. Prefer it with a petticoat but can be worn without.

This dress fits wonderfully and is of a great quality. The fabric is a rayon/cotton blend, so ironing it is a bit tricky.


Fit is great!! I was debating between the small and the medium. I went with the medium and the dress fit like a glove. The material does stretch a little, so it hugs in the right places. Follow the measurement guide to find the right fit for you. The dress is well made and the material is sturdy. It did come very wrinkled, so be prepared to iron. I usually don't purchase clothes online, but this dress worked out great.
