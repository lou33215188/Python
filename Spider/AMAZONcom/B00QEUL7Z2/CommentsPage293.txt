I bought the small and its still a little big. I'd rather it fit me snug and perfect. But the dress is beautiful and I wore it anyways!


Dress fit okay. The bright red color is just as it appears in the ad. The fabric however is a little strange. It feels costume-like. It keeps its shape without the hoop skirt beneath.


Very cute dress, my daughter loves it. It's a little loose in the bust, and it ends up being tea length for shorter ladies, but nothing a couple of quick alterations can't fix.


By far the most flattering dress I ever purchased in my life. The color is rich and beautiful and the fabric is thick and high quality. 10/10


I was very disappointed because we were suppose to wear white for Christmas to church and when I received this dress it's far from white, is a light brown or creme in color.


The dress is really cute ! But it was too long for me apparently I'm too short..  But I would definitely recommend it.. The material is really stretchy too I got a small and I'm a size 5.


To small need to return it


Fit ok Not happy with material, very wrinkled, also should be dry cleaned


The dress is ok. Disappointed that I had to have it shortened because it was to long. There was also a hole in it when I got it.


Good quality fabric and wonderful color.  It didn't fit me quite right, it was a little too big, but don't let that stop you from ordering.  Just measure carefully and enjoy a pretty dress.
