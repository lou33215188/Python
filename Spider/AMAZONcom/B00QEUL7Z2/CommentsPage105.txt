I wore this dress in Reno and It was a lot of fun! I got a lot of compliments on it. It's fits loosely, but hugs in the right places. I would highly recomend getting this dress if you want something fancy but not over the top.


Was very worried about ordering this!  Definitely go by your measurements, not what size you normally buy.  I am normally somewhere between and 10 and a 12.  My measurements are approx. 40 bust, 35 waist.  No problem with hips with this dress.  Got an XL.  You will want a petticoat - makes all the difference with this dress.  Get tons of compliments - awesome vintage dress.


Now this is how a dress is supposed to fit!  MUXXN knows how to fit in the right perportions, I bought an XL and it was true to size.


It Fit perfectly on my beautiful wife. However, The tull material on the bottom ripped out from the back when she accidentally step on it. She had to sew it by hand.


Cute style but it is NOT WHITE!! Off white or cream is a better name. I'm going to be returning it.


This dress is so flattering! It looks good no matter what your age is!


Love this!!! Just beautiful!! I purchased in 3 colors I loved it so much!!! Some said the fabric was cheap...it is not, it just has some stretch to it. Again, if you are thinking about purchasing I say go for it!!!


Fit beautifully. Comfortable with a little Wiggle room. The color is spot on and the fabric is a nice quality. I am going to buy as many varieties of this dress as I can.


This dress is so cute and comfortable!!  I've gotten tons of compliments on it and it is very flattering.  I am 5'8" and a 36D and bought the XXL.  It fits pretty well but is a little large in the bust.  The material is fairly stretchy.


I am in love. I'm a MUXXN customer now. The fabric is thick and doesn't feel cheap. It has the perfect shape and it is gorgeous!
