The small is a size 4. Generally those fit rather well. But this was just a little larger than expected.  It's not baggy. Just a little looser than it should be. That being said it is still a lovely dress. the fabric is heavy so it is perfect for the lindy bop swing styleof dance.


Love it!


It's beautiful.  The fabric is stretchy ... so I would have appreciated a tighter fit, but I LOVE the dress.


Awesome product


I am absolutely in love with this dress. The color isn't too intense but it's a n ice deep red. The length is really nice and the train I m adds a great touch. The only thing is that it runs small. I got a 2X and I could not zip it up at all. Be sure to order up a size


I bought this dress is burgundy - I wear an 18 and am very busty. I bought a 2X and the fit is roomy, but not huge, and very flattering. Great dress for work or a party! A winner!


Don't follow that size chart! My dress turned out to be three sizes to large!


I loved this dress, fit nice and looked good! I will be buying another color


Love this dress! Slightly stretchy, fit perfectly, true to color


Beautiful and flows so nice with your body through the day!!
