LOVE it


Beautiful, fit her like glove,bought for teen graduation


size is spot on, color is spot on. Love this dress


I bit too long for me (5'4")


Perfect


Dress is as appears but fabric is too stretchy for me.


Top didn't fit so well but overall I loved this dress. Very quality. Excellent material.


It fits a bit too large. Not as I expected.


It's a really flattering fit. Made with some stretchiness to it


Absolutely gorgeous dress, but much larger than expected. I normally wear a size 14-16 and I ordered an XL, dress fits loose up top and I have a rather wide rib cage. Otherwise perfect dress.
