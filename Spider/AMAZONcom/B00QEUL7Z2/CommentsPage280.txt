Fits great good material


Perfect


A bit long. Made for a taller build than 5'2".


Absolutely love it!!  It fits perfectly, which I was hoping it would. As a curvier girl, and one that is more busty (DD cup), this fit perfectly. Honestly, I probably could have been an entire cup size larger and it still would have fit.  The cut is flawless on my figure and I've never been more excited to wear a dress.  A couple downfalls that I almost expected, the color (beige) is actually coral, which I love and was hoping for. The skirt is KIND OF see-though. So I don't recommend wearing dark underthings with the light dress.


Overall, 5/5 stars.  Definitely looking to purchase another dress in another color.


Fast delivery. Great product


I love the quality of fabric and fit!


I absolutely love this dress. I got so many compliments on it. Take the time to read the Comments to be sure you order the correct size. The dress definitely has some stretch to it. Of course it was wrinkled when it arrived, but the fabric irons up beautifully. I used a pressing cloth when I ironed it to make sure I didn't add shine to it, or accidentally burn the tulle at the bottom of the dress. I did purchase a petticoat to wear under it, and I am so glad I did. I bought a rose one and a black one. I decided to go with the black petticoat, to tie in the zebra print belt and shoes. I tried to show the dress, petticoat and shoes in the pictures, but I am not the best at taking selfies! The dress is great by itself, but it is spectacular with the petticoat. This is an excellent buy for an absolutely marvelous dress!!!


Love the color and style!
