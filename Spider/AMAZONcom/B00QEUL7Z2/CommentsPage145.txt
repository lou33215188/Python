Love it! It's very comfortable and flattering. I'm between a size 8 & 10 (US) and went with a medium. The purple is a little bit brighter than shown (not as blue), but still very pretty.


 Now I just need to buy a petticoat to get the full effect :)


great dress for a great price


A very flattering, classic fit.  This dress was extremely forgiving--hid all my trouble spots (tummy, thighs) and accentuated the best parts (waist, chest).  It looked good without a crinoline but AMAZING with one.  I'm normally a size 14-16, 36DD cup and XXL fits perfectly/comfortably.  The material on the bodice is stretchy and the length hits me below the knee (I'm 5'2") and looks great.  I was worried about looking matronly but it wasn't the case at all.  This dress is sexy but tasteful and shows just the right amount of cleavage.  LOVE this dress and got tons of compliments on it.


Initially ordered a large, however it was too big. Returned for the medium and it fits perfect.


I love this dress it's comfortable and fun to wear.


I usually wear a 4 in dresses but have small chest and wider in the hips.  The extra small fits perfectly!


Simply beautiful, arrived quickly,and received  so many comments this dress


LOVE THIS DRESS! It was PERFECT for our fundraiser event!


Not as 50's looking in real life as expected, but still a nice LBD


Fits well
