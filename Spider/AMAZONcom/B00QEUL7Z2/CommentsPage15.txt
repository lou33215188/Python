I bought this dress for pictures with my children. I wasn't pleased with size suggested but figured it must just be made small. I do have a larger chest. After trying it on, first it is important to let you know the quality was great especially for the price! The size was to large really so I probably could have went a size lower but did not have time to return before pictures so I made it work. Overall, the pictures turned out very nice and this dress looks very classy when on! Very glad I made the choice to take a chance and order it!


This dress is comfortable, flattering and easy care.  I spilled (meat juice?) from a sandwich the first time I wore it, and I used a bathing suit soap (as there is some spandex in the material, which makes the fit so nice) and used the HAND WASH setting on my front load washer.  I hung it on a hanger on the shower rod and it dried spot & wrinkle free..  I am heavy but relatively small busted and it fit nicely, but feel it would have accommodated a larger bustline with no problem.  The cap sleeves were comfortable and stayed in place.  The color is bright red, which is exactly what I'd hoped for!  The little fringe on the hemline is a nice touch and calls attention to the red crinoline that I purchased.  (Both 2x)  The fabric is a bit "heavy weight" and wouldn't be good on a 90 degree day, unless you were in a/c.  Good in most temps, though.  I would consider buying it in at least one other color!


This is one of my favorite dresses here on Amazon.  It compliments every size woman.  Some are concerned about the type of fabric it is (very stretchy/elasticy).  I say, what woman hasn't had a day when she desires some extra room in her garment?!?! Depending on your bosom girth, the dress may show off your girls more than you would like. This is a full bottom on the dress, very hip and tummy friendly.  You can easily become addicted to wearing this dress.  Give it a try!  No, I did not receive my dress for free.


This dress is THE BEST!!!! It's super stretchy and comfy and twirly! I felt like a princess and, being plus-sized, I don't get that feeling very often! I had the dress altered a little to make it shorter, since it came to my mid-calf (I'm 5'3") and made me look a little frumpy with that length. I added a crinoline skirt under it (the 25" length was just right) and rocked my work Christmas party. My only difficulty with the dress was trying to iron and position the pleating at the top. It came quite squished and took a long time to get it put back to rights. But then it kind of falls out again a little when you put it on since the weight of the rest of the dress pulls on it. But the skirt is wonderfully full and swirls like a dream so I'd let that slide, if I were you. Before I ordered, I read just about all of the reviews and it really helped that someone else around my size posted what they ordered so in the spirit of sharing, I'm 5'3" and about 190lbs, H cup. I ordered an XL and there was actually room to spare everywhere except the bust; not a LOT of room, but it could've been more snug, since it's a really stretchy material.


Loved this dress


One of my favorite dresses. I feel so glamorous when I wear this.


It has just enough stretch to be forgiving of my curves and occasional weight fluctuations. The fit is not to be criticized.


The same stretch makes this a very comfortable dress to wear! I can wear it all night long and dance in it too!


There is an adorable, yet subtle touch of tulle at the bottom giving it a classic look, hinting at an under-skirt.


The skirt is full enough to wear with a crinoline and looks fantastic without as well. I have done both.


This style is very versatile. I have worn it on countless occasions: A classy retirement party. a night of Karaoke, and it also made a great day of the dead Halloween costume too.


If you wash it instead of dry cleaning use gentle and make sure you hang to dry to keep the shape intact.


Great quality for an amazing Price. I am in love and am considering buying it again in another color.


But bigger.. I guess?!.. it doesnâ€™t fit your size and the zipper is horrible.. it eventually ripped down the zipper as I got into my car to leave for a wedding. I never got to wear it. I was very disappointed. I had centered my entire outfit around this dress. As you can see it was not too small.. it was seriously the zipper and sewing. I was terribly sad. I got to the wedding late.. and had to wear a dress from a local store because I left from a different city.


I have never succeeded in ordering a dress online that fit, but I decided to take a chance with this one and I am SOOO glad I did. I love love love this dress. I am normally a size 12 and a 38B and the size Large fits with just a little room. The fabric is a bit stretchy, so I think this would easily fit a size 14 too. I love the length and this will be a great work or evening dress. I'm now going to order in more colors ğŸ™‚


Update 6/1/16


So FYI this dress wrinkles if you are consistently sitting in it (as I do). Also, I bought 3 more in patterns and even though they're the same fabric content, they feel very different. They feel a lot more like a stiff cotton, where this feels more like a stretchy polyester. They fit tighter than the solid green one I bought, and therefore I will be sending them back in exchange for solid colored ones. They still fit, but not as comfortable to sit in...


Before ordering this dress, i had ordered another dress from another seller on Amazon. Because it wasn't due to arrive until after christmas a few days after ordering that, i ordered this one also.  That one arrived and i was very dissatisfied with. Color looked cheap on me, the chest laid wrong on me, I felt like i had to change my shape to fit the dress. I worried that after that disappointment, i was due to find more sadness with this dress too. I WAS WRONG.


I will be ordering more of these dresses! I am so happy with the color, the fit, the style, the shape, EVERYTHING! It has just the right stretch, the color is gorgeous. I was thinking i would get something like the cheap dresses you find in box stores, made of cheap feeling materials, but this has some heft to it, so you aren't peeking through and feeling exposed. Perfect for my christmas dress this year! it's warm enough fabric so when you are in a chilly room, you aren't feeling as cold. I really love this dress and am going to recommend it to friends  who are looking for similar style dresses. Next thing i will be getting is a petticoat for this dress specifically.


I have never ordered a dress online and I am extremely pleased! I am pretty heavy and have straight hips so I don't have much curves. This dress is a lifesaver! I feel beautiful and curvy in this! I had numerous people say how beautiful I looked! I wore the petticoat with it. Perfect! Will definitely buy more of different colors!!!
