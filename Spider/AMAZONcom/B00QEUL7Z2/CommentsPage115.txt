This dress is great--the material is thick but soft and very comfortable. I usually wear a small but went with a medium because of the other reviews and the medium fits very well. Seems like it will be easy to dress it up or down for the occasion. And the blue color is as pictured.


Overall, this is a really cute dress but it runs a bit large, especially in the top area.  That wouldn't stop me from wearing it though.


This is a great dress! perfect for work or a night out dancing.  great flare with spins, but won't show your underwear. ordering more in other colors


Our 16 year old daughter asked me to buy this for her. It is well made and looks good on.  She looks as pretty as a picture in it. A wonderful buy.


LOVE this dress!!!!  Very good quality and was perfect for the occasion!


Dress is beautifully made!  The fabric is a good quality and the color is great! Like many reviews before mine I would definitely recommend going a size down from what you are the dress has a lot of give to it. I Returned the xl and got the large and am very pleased with the dress or looks great on! Petticoat is Def a good addition as well! ğŸ˜Š


Bought this to wear at my son's wedding (outdoor, afternoon in early June). It was perfect! Very comfortable!


I LOVE this dress.. I had my doubt's with its inexpensive pricing, but OMG!!! It fits like a dream... I don't wear dresses.. EVER... But there is an odd occasion where one is needed ... And I am the worst for finding one that fits and flatters... This does both.. I'm re ordering onein a  different color ( I got it in black) so I have all bases covered... Love love love the retro look of it.


This dress is better than I expected.  Although it's a bit large, the fabric is really nice.  It flows well, and the scalloped top is beautiful.  Since it's being worn as a costume, I'm going to wear it as is, but overall, I'm very pleased.


Lovely dress my daughter loves it!! Fits well, nicely made, great price!!
