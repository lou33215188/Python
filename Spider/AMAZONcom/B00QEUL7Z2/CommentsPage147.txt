Great dress, irons well, and fits beautifully.


This is a lovely dress, it's just a tad larger than expected. It still can be worn and looks great.


Beautiful dress I got for a 50's Halloween costume. I ended up loving it so much I wear it all the time without the crinoline for just a normal dress. Good quality, fast shipping, good sizing and it looks good on everyone!


I love the dress, and have gotten so many compliments on it! Beware, it does run large. If you are worried, I would go ahead and order a size down, as the material is very stretchy and forgiving. I'm 5'5 and 129 and originally ordered a medium and had to return it for a small.


The material and make quality for the price blows my mind. It has a very flattering fit. This will be a staple.


I wore this dress to a 50's inspired wedding.  I did NOT expect the praise & compliments I got from random people about this dress.  It is perfectly form fitting & the green color was just as pictured!  Love, love, love it!!  Will wear it again to another wedding (sans retro theme).


Very cute and nice fabric feels sturdy but feminine look.


Gorgeous dress!  The color was pretty. I'm 5'3 and 130 lbs and the small fit perfectly.  I had to return because of a small pucker at the seam that looked like my belly button - but had no trouble at all with that and will probably re-order in another color since I won't use for Valentines day.


Fits good


good quality dress however fit big, I would suggest going a size smaller
