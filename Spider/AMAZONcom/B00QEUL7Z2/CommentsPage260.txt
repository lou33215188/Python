Beautiful dress. Didn't iron well


Fabric was stretch fabric but works. Nice dress.


I would have loved it to be a little longer down & a little free on my waist line


It looked so beautiful on my girl


Loved this dress!!! I doubled the crinoline and it was beautiful...


Love it and it has some stretch to it.


This is my new favorite dress!!!


This dress is absolutely perfect! What a great value. Wonderful dress for work.


I bought this dress in two different sizes based on the reviews that said it runs small.  In my case that's definitely to my advantage- I've got an annoying pear-shaped figure which makes finding dresses a challenge.  In general things that fit over my hips are way big up top, and things that fit me up top are too tight over my hips.  I wear a 16 or XL in pants and medium/large in shirts (generally have to veer towards large, unfortunately, because of my hips.)


I bought this dress in XXL and XL.  The XXL was too big for me, the XL was perfect!  This fabric is a nice heavy knit (think ponte) with quite a bit of stretch.  I would definitely advise against sizing down, but if you aren't busty your true size should work just fine.  Girls with a more hourglass figure might have more of a challenge- I'm a B cup and the dress fit great up top with a push-up bra.  I love dresses with stretch!


The skirt definitely doesn't stand out a whole lot on its own, so get a petticoat underneath to wear with it if you want the poof.  The 20" petticoat I got with a previous order works great.


I was in love with this dress online for months! I finally gave in and bought it. I have an hourglass figure and normally wear a size 8-10.  I ordered this dress in a US6 and it is still way too big. The neckline is very high and makes it seem like my boobs are level with my armpits. The waist and total  length of the skirt portion is very low. Idk, this dress just  fits terribly.  I am very sadly returning it.
