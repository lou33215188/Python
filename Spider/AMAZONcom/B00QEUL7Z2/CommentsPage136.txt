This product fits fairly true to size. I usually wear a size 4 in pants and dresses, although I'm tall and have a large frame, so I was worried that my waist would be too big for the dress because of the size chart, but it was big enough and the fabric even gives a little! I love it! I can't wait for my petticoat to arrive!


I was absolutely thrilled to find the dress fit me just right and was very comfortable.  Follow the size chart and you will be very happy!  Great quality product!  Thank you!!


The material is great.


I am 6' 2" 195 pounds and ordered an xl.  Hits me at knee and is a little roomy in the waist but I have a belt I intend to wear with it.  Overall great dress for a great price.


I love this dress! It's flattering and fits really well. I usually wear a size 14 and the size large is great.


This dress is so cute. Retro, classic style. I bought this for theatre: a 1950s music revue and it's perfect. I plan to wear it off the stage as well. Great color, construction and quality. True to fit.


Really like the dress. Fits just right, the material stream pressed well. It was very inexpensive. Good value.


Purchased this for a friend for a halloween costume!  It was a hit!  She even wore it again at a holiday party.


Shipping was fast! Arrived on time for party.  Fits as expected, maybe a little too much room in top.  I just fit it at a C cup.  No clip on top of zipper which is annoying but still a gorgeous dress


Love this dress
