I bought this dress in red to wear for Christmas and I am in love with it!  It is such a fun, flirty little thing and the color is perfect: true red, not orangey at all.  The sleeves did not really fit me as cap sleeves, more like a wide strapped tank, but cute nonetheless.  As far as sizing, I usually wear a size 6 and I ordered a small and it fits great.  There is a bit of stretch to it: not a lot, but enough to be forgiving to a lot of body types.  The only negative I can add is the seam that runs down the front of the skirt is very noticeable, but I imagine if you were wearing it with a petticoat underneath, the shape of the dress might hide it.


I am going to go ahead and give it five stars, because the dress is beautiful, the color is so pretty, it is well made, and I love vintage swing style dresses. However, I think the sizing could be tweaked a little, I usually wear a size twelve, and I am 5'2, and on me the shoulders were big and it was low. I sent it back and got another size which I am going to keep, but the shoulders are still a little big on me, It may be because I am somewhat short, but other than that I really like the dress. I have also ordered the muxxn 3/4 sleeve length dress which I love and have gotten several compliments on, had to return on account of it being small on my shoulders. I ordered the extra large and it fits very nicely, but when I looked at the tag it says it is only a US 10; which I guess it is nice to have a dress size smaller than I usually wear, but all in all, I think the sizing needs to be fixed. But other than that, I love MUXXN.


I really liked this dress. I wore it for a wedding. I measured everything and after reading reviews saying to buy a size down I did. I feel like I could have still gone down another size and it would have been better. But I will say you will need to wear something underneath to smooth everything out. The material will show every bump and roll if you don't. Overall I would buy again. It is a gorgeous dress. I do wish it came in another material for the summer though.


There were 2 tears in the seams at the waist line. I do t have time to return and wait for a new one as I have a special event to attend. ğŸ˜•. Beautiful color, love the stretchy fabric. Needs a petticoat for the perfect look. I wear a size 16 and needed the XXL. The tag says U.S. 14 but it fits nicely.


I loved this dress! I had many complements on it first time I wore it to a friend's wedding. Great for a gal of any size & shape. Unfortunately after 2 washes it is looking good pretty sad. I am sad, too.


Best dress evah! I've been trying to find something for a retro-rockabilly dance number I'm doing, and I've ordered dress after dress. Some ended up too big, others too small, others too revealing, others too frumpy, others too this, too that - but this, I'd actually wear in real life, *and* it also works for the dance number. The stretchy fabric also makes it fit without needing to be altered, but it's not so stretchy as to reveal things one feels are best not revealed.


I purchased this dress to wear to a Kentucky Derby party.  I was skeptical at first, seeing as I do not own any products from this company and wasn't sure how the dress would fit, but I have to say it fits perfectly, the material is extremely comfortable, and the style is very flattering!  The bonus is that I can wear this for other events, other than a Kentucky Derby party.


I am a 42 DDD/42 F, so I was nervous about buying a dress online. I was pleasantly surprised! It fits beautifully, is comfortable, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. I am just shy of 5'2, so it hits below the knee. I did buy a crinoline to wear with it for dressier occasions. It's a nice heavy fabric, not thin and cheap looking. I would definitely buy again.


Nice dress with a flirty swing to it. I ordered the medium size in black and it fit very well.  I'm 5'4" and 145lbs and normally wear medium or size 8 to 10 in dresses. I'm paring it with fuchsia pink heels & clutch bag for my 25th HS reunion. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the length. I wish it was just a little shorter, it falls on me an inch or two below the knees and it has somewhat of a matronly look. The material is nice and the bodice hugs the torso perfectly.  This dress is made for the women who want to hide the hips and it does that perfectly.


This is a nice dress! I'm using it in the theater for a show, so I need to be able to move in it. The material is stretchy & comfortable. Get a petticoat for the fluff effect. It works well. Definitely use the size chart! I wear a 10/12, but had to order a 3X to fit my measurements. Inside it says US 14. I do have room in it & I'm 5'4" at 187 lbs. I have a muscular build with wide shoulders. My waist is 36 1/2 & this is comfortable on me with room in the waist. I have washed it on delicate & steamed it after it hung dry. It looks fantastic! Good quality for the money.
