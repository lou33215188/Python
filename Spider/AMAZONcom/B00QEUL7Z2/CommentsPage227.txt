Great dress! Beautiful fit and material for an inexpensive dress


It fits perfectly and the material is lightweight and very comfortable.


The shaping on the chest area was really cheap and didn't look right...stitching was awful....better for small sizes


This was a gift I got for my wife she is 5'4" and 110lb I got her a small and she loves it. . .


I originally bought this dress in an XL then bought a second one in a XXL. I like the fit of the larger size better but love both dressers. I want it in every color!


Getting complements!


Pretty dress.  Buy smaller than what you think you'll wear.  Stretchy and big.


This dress is beautifully made, but is MOST DEFINITELY NOT COTTON! The iron left a mark on the fabric, even on the lowest setting. It came wrinkled, and it needed to be ironed through a sheet of Tephlon. Definitely not cotton. Also, the "sleeves" are narrower than shown in the picture. Otherwise, it's beautiful, it fits great, and I can wear it with Converse without getting too many funny looks.


Love the color!  Love the material!  Perfect size match!


It fit beautifully! Very flattering, cute and feminine. I wrote this to my bridal shower and got so many compliments!
