This dress fits beautifully. The color is rich and it does not look cheap, even though it is so reasonably priced. I would highly recommend purchasing this dress!


It was a great dress, but I ended up not liking the style on me. It was a great material and it was really comfortable though


Love it. Very comfortable. I'm a 40DD and was nervous it might not fit well across the chest as I've heard ordering clothes online can be hit or miss. It's perfect.


This was bought for my daughter to wear under her graduation gown. She is absolutely thrilled with the way it looks and is working on finding the perfect shoe to wear.


I absolutely love the style of the neck line. Pleats are perfect. Fabric is thick and good quality. Way too long and I'm tall!! I'll have to hem the length.


Bought this in small for my somewhat tall 12 year old, and only had to do a minor tuck in the torso area for it to be a perfect fit - bought it with a petticoat for a flared look, the style was simple and elegant, everyone loved it on her


Nice but smaller than I expected  I returned it. Nice quality


Very comfortable. True to size.


Love this dress! It fit so well. I'm 5' 3", 170# and big busted and the Large was perfect. I may hem it because it's a tad long. I'd like it just below my knees and it's about mid calf.


Material is nice (to me, anyway). Bodice is flattering as is the waist. There are a few seams that needed to be fixed, but they were easy to do so. Would recommend buying a petticoat to go underneath to make it floofier.
