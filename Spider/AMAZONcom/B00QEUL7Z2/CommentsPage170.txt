This dress was also cut too small, but the style was terrific.


The color is beautiful! It says beige but its a beautiful coral!!!


This dress is lovely and has a quality feel to it. My daughter gets compliments whenever she wears it.


good to go


Fits exceptionally well and excellent quality.


Can't wait for date night~


Dress was gorgeous but it is not flattering on a busty woman.  Had to return.


I usually wear a 10 or 12 dress and I ordered the 12.  This fit as expected, slightly loose in the waist.  I like the stretch in the fabric, also the weight of the fabric. Have not worn it outside of the house yet...


I did not care for the fabric. I thought the dress looked summer-y, but it was very heavy. The color was also not as bright as I expected. I am planning on returning it.


Beautiful dress fit well the fabric is a little heavier than I expected but can wear this all seasons
