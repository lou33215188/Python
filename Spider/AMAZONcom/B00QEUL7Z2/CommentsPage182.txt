Very cute, but the sleeves are very tight and I have very small arms. I would say the small fits like a size 4. I could get it on but it was pretty uncomfortable.


This dress needs the slip to make it pretty and the middle is very clingy - but overall it's comfortable and will be perfect for any party or occasion dressing up counts.  I would order it again


Got it for a wedding! So cute! It's actually one I'll wear again :)


Excellent! Worth every penny. The perfect dress if you are pear shaped and/or bottom heavy and don't want to wear the shorter dresses that are in style these days. Very feminine and lady like.


I love love this dress.. I made a mistake an order the next size up.. So it's a little big.. So please order your exact size... It looks nice without the corset, but I think it looks even better with the corset... I am ordering the red next..


Way too big but the quality was nice for the price. Returned it and was quickly refunded.


This dress fits nicely, except the arm holes are a little tight due to the soft elastic fabric that finishes off the cap sleeves.


Perfect fit. Love how it looks on me. Very beautiful and elegant


Returned because I didn't like that it was made of that clingy type material. Gorgeous color and good fit otherwise.


Although the service was great, and the dress fits as I expected it to, I have to make a relatively disappointing comment, as I ordered a burgundy dress but received a deep red dress.
