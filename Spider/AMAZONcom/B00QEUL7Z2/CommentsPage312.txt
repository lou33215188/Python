Nice dress but it's a little small...


Fit as expected. It has a very beautiful under layer and the gown is perfect for a formal dress in a special event. Thanks for this.


I love the design. It fits the color of the dress. Lovely dress. Cute!!


i am 5'8'' 126lbs and L is a little largeï¼Œit is very comfortable


Absolutely terrible...if you expect to be able to wear this for anything other than Halloween you are being mislead. Looked like it could have been a cute dress to wear to an upcoming event and I could not be less satisfied with the awful quality.


love this dress; has stretch so a size 10 fit a 38D bust. Comfy :)


I love the totality of the dress. Vintage is really the most beautiful!


The color of this dress is perfect for my wife.


Good quality. a petticoat wearing inside looks even better.
