Perfect. Great quality fabric very well done. Use the size chart and it fits perfect!!!! It is a beautiful yellow and comfortable fit. Very flattering.


I love this dress  even though it's really hot because it's all polyester but it fits beautifully and I've gotten tons of compliments


Great thick, stretch fabric.  I wear a 6 usually and bought a small; tiny bit big but very close! Threw in dryer after washing and it shrunk just a little bit. ..fits perfectly.  I'm 5'5 and the length is below knee. Very comfortable and flattering. Purchased for my daughter's 3rd birthday party.


Wasn't sure when ordering how it would look for an evening cocktail dress, but it is very flattering. The material has stretch in it, so it lays nicely and moves well.


I LOVE this dress. Itâ€™s comfortable, fit just like the chart said it should and worked perfectly for what I wanted.


I normally wear a Large, so that's what I ordered, and it was a little big. Not big enough to be a big problem, but it would have been nice if was a little more snug. Also, the color on the website is a darker red but the actual color is a bright red. I still like it, but would have liked the color shown better. I am going to need to hem the bottom because it's too long for me. I'm 5'1, and it falls several inches below my knees. I did purchase a 26" petticoat to wear with it, but it looks good either way (better with, in my opinion). The neckline is not nearly as sexy as it looks like it would be from the picture. I have a pretty large chest so I never have to work hard for cleavage, but this top covers it all up. Overall, it's a nice dress. It will definitely need some ironing before wearing. Four stars because the color is off from what's shown.


Nice color, material, and style.  Bought for a costume piece for my daughter, but will wear it to church too.


Loved it! Would buy again. I wear a 16 and am a little busty so I ordered the XXL. It fit perfect. The material is very comfortable and stretchy. I also purchased the Rockabilly Petticoat, all in black, and wore it to a wedding. Received several compliments!  Would recommend!


L fits my size 10 pant size very well. My bust (36DD) out stretches the ruffles a bit more than they should. Material is thinner than expected. Definitely can see any patterned underwear or bra through the material. As long as you wear nude underneath, it will do.


Yummy and more IMPORTANTLY, MORE YUMMY!!ğŸ˜‚
