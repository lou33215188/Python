I love this dress!  I ordered a small and I'm 5'7" 140 pounds bra size A34.  It fits beautifully!! The dress is made so well too.  The dress is also made to stretch a little.  I think a small would fit up to 5'8" 150 pounds and a much bigger chest size!  Very happy with this dress.


Did not come in the color I expected, "so disappointed"but I will not return because it a good dress, it fits well. So I'm giving it 4 stars.


I bought this for an Alice in Wonderland costume and I love this dress.


It's fitting but not too clingy. The color is beautiful and I hope I can wear it again for another event.


Size 12 ordered large perfect and beautiful with petit skirt!


Nice dress afor a special occasion. Love the color.


This was a fantastic dress for the cost. The Material felt surprisingly high quality, as it was both thick and sturdy. The only downside about this dress was the zipper. They made the zip line longer than it needed to be, and there's a part where the stitch point intersects that causes the zipper to 'hitch.' I might need to replace the zipper to make that problem go away. Otherwise, amazing! It was well worth the 30-something bucks I paid for it.


Fits well except top is loose. I'm not well endowed and when I bend forward it shows everything. I'm going to try to alter it. Otherwise I like it.


I ordered a size up bc the other dresses I've ordered were small. I was going to return and get my actual size but it was almost double the price so i figured id keep this one. To bad the smaller sizes were more expensive but the dress itself i do love. However it fit longer than expected and 5'9

I absolutely LOVE this dress. It's so much fun and comfortable and it is very flattering for the figure! You don't need spanx or anything its such a nice "forgiving" fabric. You can gain or lose weight and the dress fits beautifully!!! I want more in other colors!
