Love Love LOVE this dress! The fit is fantastic, plus the fabric is medium weight with excellent draping. I got so many compliments! I wear a size 22 and a size 2X is a snug, but flattering fit for me.


Flattering dress. My husband ordered this dress for me to wear to his Christmas party and I had my doubts. It looked much better on than I expected. The material ironed easily and hung nicely.


VERY pretty and extremely flattering. Love this color, but lots to choose from.I'll probably add a thin belt.


Beautiful Dress, fits as expected. For someone who is 5' 2" this dress is tea length. Looks great both with and without a petticoat.


This dress is amazing and if I wore more dresses I would absolutely order it in more colors.  I was comfortable all night in it.  On top I am a 40DD and it was fitted but comfortable.


Perfect fit, and i like the msterial..if i go up one size or go down one size it will still fit.I realy love it.


Good job Amazan.


a little to big but loved the dress


Beautiful dress! It has stretchy fabric, which is always a girl's best friend.


This dress is very flattering and not fussy at all.


The fabric comes in a little wrinkled, which will need to be dry-cleaned or steamed.


I wouldn't recommend ironing.


Overall, I'm really psyched about this dress


p.s. I loved it so much, I bought it in both black and red


Good.


Stunning dress Amazing love it fits perfectly material is the best will absolutely recommend.
