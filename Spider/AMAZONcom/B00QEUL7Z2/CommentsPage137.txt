I love the dress. It is very cute. Runs small.


Fits as expected. Thicker material; looks like it will last awhile.


Fits well. Dress is too long without a petticoat, hits below knees. (I'm 5'9")Just to knees would be perfect. Wish the waist was higher- sits in an odd place. Color is nice.


LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! The color is perfect & the fit is amazing!! I listen to the reviews & went up a size. I am 5'8, a size 16, 38DDD bust and went with XXL.


love this dress!  I didnt realize it was stretchy so I'm swapping the Large out for a medium.  I normally wear a 12/14.


I love this dress!! It fits perfectly and looks fabulous with the red petticoat i ordered for under it.


I love this dress, ita comfortable ans fits great, it looks flattering despite my size and my husband loves it on me. He wants me to buy more in different colors haha.


Nice dress


I bought this to wear to a wedding. I usually wear a large and it fit fine. My dress ripped completely open before we even got food. Disaster of a night.  Very Cheap material!!!


Buyer beware: cheap material


Beautiful dress, fits perfectly. Very flattering and excellent material. Accentuates your figure while still allowing you to breath and move. Stylish and comfortable.
