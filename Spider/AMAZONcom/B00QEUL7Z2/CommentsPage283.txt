Beautiful fit/style!!


It's good! I like it.


Better than expected


love this!


So many compliments, fits beautifully. Paired it with red shoes and a red belt for Christmas party. Not too low cut, not too short. Perfect modest yet sexy dress. I had a foofy thing to go under it, didn't need it, added to much bulk. I hope to wear it again.


Great dress!


I am 5'4" 140 lb.  bust size 36D.  I fall between a petite and regular so I usually go for the regular and find the torso a bit long but do-able.  The dress is a very good fit per the sizing and the other reviews.  In the bust area there is generous material so this is probably a better fit for a medium to a larger busted woman. The material is very nice and a substantial weight for a stretch fabric and something that could definitely be worn to a formal occasion.  It feels very good on and looks great.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase and recommend giving it a try!


Have some trouble with the zipper,  when fastening it.  Zipper not very strong , you need to be very careful with it.  But once it is up fits well.


I bought this for an event at work. I recieved many compliments. The dress is a thick, sturdy, and stretchy material that really makes the dress fit nicely. I have a larger bust & I'm curvy (normally a 12-14), so I ordered an XL, but I could've fit into a size smaller. It was a little big, but I wore it with a shawl to cover the looser areas. I'm 5'8" & it came down to my knees. Very classy! Great dress!


Not gonna lie, this dress is horrible. The material is gross and scratchy. I gave it to a friend of mine who will wear anything. I was going to wear it to a wedding but chose something I already had instead. It was just all around bad.
