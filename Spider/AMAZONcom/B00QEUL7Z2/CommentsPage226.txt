This is a great dress.  Perfect fit.  Great price for the quality!


Bought a medium and it fits perfectly.  The material has a little give, and is a nice weight.  I'm 5'6" & 160 lbs.


This dress is classy and fun. I would highly recommend it to anyone!


Very nice dress, it's just too long... but you can always go see a tailor i guess


Really pretty the side zipper is problematic so I will be returning this dress


This dress is beautiful. Purchased for my daughter, the fit was exactly as expected. I would buy it again.


A must buy! Fabric feels nice with a little lycra type stretch and well constructed garmet. Looks fabulous! I bought one in black & green.


Okay, this dress is GORGEOUS. Note to future buyers, it is VERY stretchy and not in a cheapy fabric way. The stretch does not make it bulge or look thin. It's a thick, heavy, sturdy fabric and making it stretch abit just serves to accentuate your figure. Full figures will look GREAT in this dress! I probably could have gone a size down and been okay. It will fit busty girls best, the bust and neckline is really meant to hold and show off a big bust. I got the XL and my 38D cup breats just barely fill it. If I'd been any smaller the top might have been saggy in the bust....


The ONLY thing I don't like about this dress is something that other reviewers mentioned. There are really ugly obnoxious seamlines.... there's one around the midsection and one running down the front of the skirt. The midsection one is the one I hate because it cuts off my wastline in a strange way. I think I might sew a ribbon or something in to cover it....


Otherwise this dress is truly stunning, great craftmanship and very comfy and flattering! I 100% recommend buying it, especially curvy women!


Fantastic! The dress was beautiful and exactly what I wanted!


Fits Great, looks Great!
