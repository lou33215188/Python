The dress came quickly and fit better than I hoped! The material is very nice. I definitely recommend!


It's a cutie dress but runs big. I got a small and need to get it altered.


Love the product

Totally love the fit of this dress it is figure flattering as I just had my baby 3 months ago and I am still carrying some of my baby weight.

Bodice is too big.  Will have to take in. Dress very comfortable.


Looked nice, but the zipper busted the first time my daughter bent down to pick up something.
