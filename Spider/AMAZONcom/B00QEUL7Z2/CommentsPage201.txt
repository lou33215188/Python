I LOVE the style of this dress. For the most part, it fit around my waist and bust. The length was very long! I'm 5'0" and the dress was almost to my ankles. I had a lot of alteration done, which ended up costing more than the dress..


It fits fairly true to form, but the XXL was too big in the bust (I'm a 38c). It fit great otherwise.


I usually don't wear dresses, however, this dress just seemed to pretty to pass up.


I love the style and look, but the material is super soft and stretchy. I love wearing it.


It's better than I expected. Looks great


Beautiful dress. Very fast shipping. Sizing wasn't as expected.


Gorgeous color and great fit.


Like other reviewers have said, order a size smaller. I am usually a medium, but decided on a small. This dress fits like a glove. I bought the "beige" color, though it is more of a peach. It's a beautiful dress.


great fit, and flattering with my big tummy.


This Dress is beautiful But runs about two sizes too small.
