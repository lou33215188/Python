ZOMfriggenG THIS DRESS IS AMAZING!  Soooooo flattering, nice fabric, just lovely.  I am so in love with this dress I may never take it off.


Thank you so much, it fit my sister perfectly and she loved it.


Beautiful


Great quality--very stretchy for any extra room I may require.  Fabric does seem to wrinkle easily, but with correct storage it should be fine!


This is such a comfortable dress..


Wore this to an emerald ball and got a lot of compliments. I did wear it with a petticoat.


The dress is so comfortable and is very flattering.
