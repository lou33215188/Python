Beautiful dress, fits great. Not lined, but that's not surprising for the low price. I will definitely buy from this company again.


Wife looked outstanding - had the Babyonline womens 50s vintage Rockability poofy thing underneath it - She had everyone saying how beautify she looked.


Just as expected. Would definitely buy from again.


Perfect length and fit


Love it. Fits great. Nice heavy material


Perfect fit, beautiful dress.


Beautiful dress! I love the material and the fit! I will definitely buy a few of the other prints too!


Absolutely adorable on! Classic style that made me look and feel like a 50s TV diva.


Beautiful dress!  Look forward to wearing to an up coming wedding!  I am 5'1 and 138 lbs.  It was Perfect.


Fits wonderfully and feels great!
