I love this dress, i love the material


I like it.  The material is very thick and well made.  A little longer than I wished for.  I am five feet five inches and it hits below my knee.  Overall a nice dress.


Since reading all the reviews about the sizing I decided to go down a size just to be safe and I'm glad I did. Normally I wear a S so I bought an XS and it fit perfectly. The dress in nicely made, it's a little stretchy so it's a comfortable snug fit. So glad with the purchase.


Ordered the Med for my daughter (5'9") size 6.  Plenty of room in the medium.  Stretchy material. Looks more expensive than it is.


The dress is if good quality and great care when made. Looks good too. I ordered a large due to most dresses having ti fit properly I have to order a large but with this dress it came out a bit looser than expected. If order a medium next time.


The dress is beautiful! However, I ordered an extra large which I expected to fit me. This XL is more like a size 12 and the dress has been given to my daughter in law instead. She is thrilled!


I am Mrs Jer, The dress is for me. They should tell you to buy the netted slip for under the skirt portion. This reminds me of the school dances in the 50's. Fun to see styles always come back. Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's.


I love this little dress!  It's really well made and the fabric really helps enhance the style.  The skirt falls just right and it stretches just enough in all of the right places.  I will definitely look for more dresses by this designer.


Flattering and stretchy. Looks great with blue petticoat.


The cap sleeves hit right in my armpit, thankfully only wearing for a wedding reception. Other than that fits perfectly and looks great. Navy Blue. As stated....some come out lighter than pictured. Very flattering dress!
