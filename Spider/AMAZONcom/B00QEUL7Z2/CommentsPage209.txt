Absolutely love it and it came fast


The seam up the middle of the skirt makes it bulge out and it is VERY unflattering.  Somehow the color draws attention to the seam.


I bought this dress for my brother wedding. I really like the dress and it almost firs perfect. The only thing thats not perfect is that the shoulders are a little snug on me.


Love it


I wear a XL and I could have gotten a L but will be keeping it because I need it.  I did order a petticoat because it had no flare


Love this dress. Will be ordering in different style and color.


I have a 38D,16/18 size and the boob area was sorta baggy .have to wear a padded bra. would recommend weraing two pedicoats


It is so rare to order an article of clothing that fits properly, AND is well made!  Lovely fabric, and quality tailoring.


Fit as expected but very bad material quality.


Love it! The pictures don't give it justice! Material is good quality and a little stretchy to give you that "made just for you" look!
