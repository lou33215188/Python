Love it!  I'm wearing for an upcoming event with an amazing Hat.  My intention is to create a glorious Madmen effect.


LOVE this dress, I loved it so much I ordered in another color


Nice


Really cute but the cap sleeves were not flattering on me.  I ordered up a size thinking it ran small, but I did not find that to be the case.  Nice party dress!


Beautiful, fast delivery, and feels great! Planning on ordering another one in the future.


I really like this dress it was just the right size my family love it also


Received with a broken zipper.


Great fit - great price!  Handwash only, meh, but it will last longer probably if I do that.


Luv it, fits perfect


The dress fits perfect! Material is stretchy so it gives off a custom fit look without it actually being custom fit, also came in a week early! Very impressed. A must buy!
