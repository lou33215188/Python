I am getting ready for a Church event that this dress will be a hit. It is the color I need and it fit perfect.


Returned because of cheap quality


The dress was very cute and fit well. I am giving it 4 stars because the zipper got stuck after the first wear but I may buy again.


Flattering &comfortable


I wasn't expecting it to be large on me - but I had plenty of room to move in it!


I really like this.  Cute dress for the price.


This dress is absolutely amazing! After reading the reviews on here, I was pretty comfortable with getting the dress. I am 5'9 and got a small and it fits like a charm (its a US size 4) I also bought Babyonline Women's 50s Vintage Rockabilly Petticoat, 25" Length Underskirt, Black. Put it together and you have the perfect vintage look.


I bought this for my daughter's wedding and it's perfect, I can also wear it for everyday. I bought a size larger than I normally wear due to other reviews said it's not true to size and it fitted perfect... Love this dress.


Too big, gave us half of the money back since it was going to cost too much to ship it back.


Beautiful material, a bit stretchy.  Rich color.
