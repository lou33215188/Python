Beautiful but HUGE!!!!


totally cute, I bought this in another color for an actress in a show I'm costuming, but had to get one for myself in red too.


Fits great. Ordered a large. I wear a size 12 pants and 36 c bra. Fabic is great, not cheap at all. Love it.


Got this for new years. Love it. I'm 5'6'' 150lbs and a M fit perfectly. However, only wish the sleeves were a little longer otherwise great dress.


Love this dress. I wore it to a black tie event and received numerous compliments. The fit was perfect. Plan to order another, in red, for our company Christmas party.


Dress is beautiful, Pay attention to the size chart I am usually a 10-11 US sizes after reading reviews and size chart I went with the XL instead of L and it fits perfect!!


This dress is fabulous! Wearing it to a Gladys Knight Concert next week!


I wore this for Easter 2016 (yellow color) and I received compliment after compliment!


Love love love this dress! Bought it for a Press Association awards banquet, can't wait to wear it. It fits perfectly stretchy fabric, made well. I bought it in black. I would definitely purchase again.
