Buy 1 size down or your size and alter. Worth it. Beautiful dress. Color is an emerald green. Not dark hunter green.  Will need the arm straps adjusted and altered as you can see my "under arm flab", that every has.  It sits weird. Definitely order the petticoat,  without it the dress is a bit limp.  Makes waist look small. A but low cut.
