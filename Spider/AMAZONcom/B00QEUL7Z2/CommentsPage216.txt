This has become my favorite wardrobe piece.  Love the look and feel of it.  Very flattering.


love this dress--wear it so frequently.  easy and flattering and not much different from a very expensive version of the same style I bought a year ago.  Well loved dress in my house!


Loved it so much I bought one in another color


This is a gorgeous dress! The fit is true to size and the is a true purple. Am so anxious to wear it in about a week


I totally could've gone a down a size due to the stretch but otherwise it was perfect!!! Great fit for those of us who have big boobs!!!


Just as described. Fit well


Perfect fit!  Nice cut and draping.


My daughter has been wanting a swing dress, as she loves the  fiftys style.  We have been all over the mall,and always leave dissapointed.  I am certain we will be shopping at this sight often.


Dress received was not the same as the dress presented in the picture. Dress did not have the layer of tule as pictured. Also received a size different from the size that I ordered.


Love this dress! im 5ft 6in 130pounds and got a size small fits like a glove
