I gave it to a friend who I knew would look really nice in it. She loves it.


I ordered a size down with this dress and it was still too big.  The pictures all look great on here, but when I tried it on...well, I felt like I looked like I was in a bridesmaid dress for a wedding.  Not the look I was going for.


The sizing chart is far from accurate US sizes. MATERIAL was lower quality than expected.


Bought this for a work party. It's beautiful and exceeded my expectations.


Beautiful bridesmaids dresses fit each girl wonderfully


My daughter LOVES this dress and is a perfect fit! She has received lots of compliments


Much brighter yellow than I wanted. A little tight in the wrong places, but still comfortable. no pockets :(


nice dress.  color was as advertised.  Heavy weight material that does not wrinkle


I was very worried about the color but it came as pictured.  I would also strongly recommend a petticoat.


Would have given 5 stars, but the green was much different than pictured. It was more of a olive green. But the dress fits great, received many compliments on it.
