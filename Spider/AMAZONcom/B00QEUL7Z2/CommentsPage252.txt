Comfortable and looks great


Cute, but a little disappointed in the quality.  Needs a flouncy slip underneath


Great service and product.


The dress wrinkled to much and the top part of the dress just did not fix right


Great dress for rehearsal dinner.


I love this dress! I'll be getting a few more.


Order a size smaller and it fits perfect.


Beautiful dress. Just a smidge large at the bust. I'm a B cup.


It fits great and is very comfortable to wear all day. I will be back.


Fits like a glove! I look amazing!!
