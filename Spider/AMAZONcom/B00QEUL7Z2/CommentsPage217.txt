I love this dress! I thought it would be too small but it ended up complimenting my figure. With a choker, it looks absolutely fantastic and modernly dark.


I was worried at first about the size but when I tried it on it fit perfectly. I love the feel of it. I'm very happy with this dress.


This dress is great. Quality material. Makes you feel pretty and want to twirl and twirl.


Love it! Fits perfectly, color is gorgeous


I love the dress it worked perfectly for my sisters wedding


This dress was perfect! It fit my body perfectly and everyone was complimenting me a night! Will purchase again in a different color!


I was surprised how heavy the dress was showing good quality.


Love this dress!!!!!!! The fabric is thicker than what I expected, but it lays wonderfully!


very nice!


Way too big, i ordered a medium and am usually a medium to large in most clothes.
