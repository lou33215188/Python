Love this dress and style


Love this dress. The stretchy material was so comfortable. I'm about 140 pounds and 5'6 and ordered a medium. The blue is georgious. Dry cleaning is recommended. Received lots of compliments.


I got so many complements in this dress, even though I always feel like I don't look good in anything. I'm going to get it again in more colors! I always wear a petticoat with it, though, because it makes it look floofy and amazing <3


Love this dress, fits like a dream! Has a beautiful vintage cut


I love it and looking to purchase in another color. Well made too.


Once we took into account other people's comments about size.  Looks great on my daughter.  She is using it for an interview.


Beautiful dress, as expected, the color, the material, the fit are great.


Dress fit perfectly and I'm in love with it. I feel really comfortable in it and it's great for going to the theatre. It's a dream come true for me, I can't say that about any other dress I've ever owned. It's a must-have especially for curvy chicks like me.


[Wife Posting Review] PERFECT dress for a curvy figure! I added a high waist belt and shrug  which made the perfect Christmas dress. I will be ordering more of these dresses!


The size fit as expected and the color was as expected. The fabric is wonderfully comfortable. My only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily and it is hard to iron the folds in the bodice. Love it though!
