Omg do I love this dress. I'm borderline between misses and plus, it depends on the cut. Xl fit prefectly. It fits just right in the bust and middle. I'm buying as many more as I can afford. Sea foam green is darker in person though :/


Good


There was NO invoice with this dress.


I want to retutn it to exchange for a size 14 and a different color.


It's not white, it's beige


This dress is seriously awesome.  I was browsing around, looking for a dress for an upcoming event.  I'm heavier right now than I'd like to be, so I was looking for something that would be forgiving while still looking great.


This dress is it!


The fabric is sturdy yet stretchy; it's comfortable but supportive in the right places; the overall effect is slimming and flattering.  The bustline is a nice happy medium as well-  modest enough and well structured.  I didn't feel like I was going to fall out- and I can wear a regular bra with it, and just pin the straps under a bit if needed.  (BTW, I'm 5' 7", 38D, 36 in waist, 43 in hips at the moment.)


The dress looks nice without a petticoat, so I can wear it for everday/date nights.  I did order a 26" petti to fluff out the skirt for my event.  (The skirt is full enough that I felt like twirling like a little girl...  hehee)


It fits perfectly, but it doesn't accentuate my torso. I love the chest area and length of the dress.


This is a great looking dress and very well made. My only problem was the waistline was too high and I had to return it.


Love this dress, material feels great, ordered in a large and it fits perfect, I wear a 36 dd bra, and size 10 pants. Beautiful! Better quality than I expected.


Terrible fit.


Looooove it!!!! Love the fabric, the weight of the dress, the hidden zipper, the swing of the dress. EVERYTHING.


Can't wait to order more!
