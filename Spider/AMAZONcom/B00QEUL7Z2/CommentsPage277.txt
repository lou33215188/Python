I ordered the deep emerald green color is this dress. I normally wear a 10/12 and ordered the large. I've worn it without, but prefer to pair it with a petticoat. The over fit, fabric and style is great. I've worn this dress multiple times and gotten compliments on it. It's the first MUXN dress I've bought and I've purchased for more since!


Fits great


Wrong size


5'9", 135 lbs, 34b bust. Ordered a medium.  Overall fit well, snug around torso, flared skirt. Looked great if I sat still, but chest concave when I moved. Need boobs to hold up thir dress. Returning.
