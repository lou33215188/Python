It was somewhat large in the chest and back area. Fits wonderfully otherwise. The dress was slightly lighter in color than picture shows.


I love this dress, very impressed with the quality


Well-cut, quality fabric-beautiful dress.


Love it!


I decided to take a chance on this dress even after reading a few negative reviews but I hope I can prevent someone else from wasting their money.


When it first arrived I noticed that the top  "pattern" or whatever you call it, was loose, not completely stitched down but it looked okay and the dress was comfortable so I decided to keep it since my husband loved the dress on me. After only a few times wearing it the one panel completely came apart. Now it looks so soupy sloppy that it is unwearable. I don't have the sewing skills to fix it myself and don't think it's worth spending another $30 on it to have it fixed by a seamstress, especially since I also hate the seams down the middle that can't be "fixed".


Save yourself the money and buy elsewhere


Its a little tight around the breast area ( but I do have large boobs)... love  the dress


The dress just looked poorly made as it was WAY too big.


Great dress! I usually wear a 14-16 and the 2XL was a loose.  Not too loose but I bet 2XL is closer to a US size 18 equivalent.  Will buy again! Love the fabric and the cut!


I just LOVE this dress. The fabric is stretchy and heavy that makes it seem much more expensive than what it was. It is also a very flattering cut and hides all the rolls and bulges very well. I just want to keep twirling!


Very nice and comfortable dress
