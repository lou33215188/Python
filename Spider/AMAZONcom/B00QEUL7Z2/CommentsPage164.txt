The dress itself is meh, it's ok for the price. There's really no shape to it like the picture, plus it's really long. It falls mid-calf on me, either that or I'm just short.


Great dress!! Will be wearing it officially on Saturday for a wedding but Iâ€™ve tried it on a couple times and I love it!


I really like it overall, and the fit is nice, but I was hoping for a little more coverage at the shoulder. The neck line was a little too wide for my taste, and I wish there was a little more to the cap sleeve.


I returned this because it was much too big and way too long. I followed the size chart that was give and still had an issue, sadly. Quality of fabric was nice but way too big.


I was really happy to find such a lovely dress in my mail yesterday.


I absolutely love it! It it very flattering.


I plan to buy a few more in different colors.


Just got my dress today and it fit just perfect! I am so excited to try it when I get married, just waiting for my black pettycoat which I know that I will look amazing! It is most definitely a beautiful dress!


Excellent dress! It fit perfectly. The fabric has a little stretch to it, so I would recommend ordering the size you think you need.


Fit beautifully. I'm 5'3, 38DD and bought a medium. The material does stretch and fits nicely around your curves. I received many compliments.


LOVE THIA DRESS! It's perfect. I typically wear a size 4 and this dress is great. It fits properly everywhere and I love the color. I'm in love with it.


Love the dress. Sizing was accurate.
