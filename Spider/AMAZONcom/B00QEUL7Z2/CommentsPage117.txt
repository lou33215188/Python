Great dress!!! Fabric is stretchy, great for women with curves. :-)


Nice material. Nicely made. I'm very happy with it


It's beautiful. I chose the "beige" option because it looked pink. When the dress came, it is like a coral pink. I was happy because that was exactly what I wanted! I'm 5'10" and roughly 125lbs and I hit a small. It fits perfect. The length goes just a few inches past my knees.


Love it!  Great fit for an inexpensive dress.  Fabric is what you would expect at this price point (clearly not a fine fabric!), but it's thick and comfortable, and very forgiving ğŸ˜‰


Cute dress but it fades and gets extremely wrinkled.  I went dancing in it and it faded on my undergarments.


Adore this dress! Wore it as a bridesmaid's dress for my friend's wedding and got so many compliments, it's extremely flattering, especially on pear shaped women like me


Cute dress. Good price. Fit as expected. Only aspect of the dress for which I don't care is that the zipper is not great; it has a tendency to get stuck between the bodice and the skirt. Other than that, I love the dress.


I ordered the size based on my waist size.  I loved the way it fit and received lots of compliments on it, but the zipper messed up when I washed it.


I love this dress!! It is extremely well made, fit exactly as I had anticipated, and it looks beautiful on. the material that it's made out of is slightly stretchy so even if its a little small it's still going to fit you fine. it's the perfect vintage dress. I bought it and green, I plan to go back for other colors.


A little darker than I expected but it fits well. The material is less soft than I wanted and feels like it'll need to be ironed. Despite this its very classy and not too formal.
