I love this dress, I also have it in green! It looks wonderful especially after I add one of my favorite petticoats.


I didn't like the quality of the dress


The material is great, but the only problem was the size. Order 1 size less.


The bust was way too small, but everything else, including the waist, fit fine.


We purchased the purple dress. The color is great and the fit is perfect!  The fabric is slightly stretchy so it fits exactly right. So many compliments when wearing!


Unfortunately, the dress did not fit ~ too large. The front top pleats do not stay flat.


Very cute and comfy. However


 Its a little too long for my style but can make it shorter with a dress belt.


Fit well and looked great. Needed a lot of steaming to keep its shape.


Love this dress!  Fits great!


Love this dress! Fir, colour, all better than I expected. If you're a hippy girl, this for you.
