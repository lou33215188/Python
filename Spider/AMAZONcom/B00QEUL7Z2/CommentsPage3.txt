I'm in love with this dress! I bought this dress to wear to a friends wedding. It was my first time buying any clothing online! I read many of the reviews before ordering, and I agree that you need to use the sellers fitting guide and not amazon's. Package arrived in a padded envelope with the dress in a plastic bag. I found the dress to be very light weight, stretchy and comfortable. I'm 5ft2, 198 lbs and I got a 2X. Length wise it hit me about mid calf. I would highly recommend this dress to anyone. From the minute I got out of my car I got compliments about this dress! I did order a separate petty coat to wear under this. It really makes the difference and gives you that perfect twirl! For those wonder the dress IS dry clean only. I took 2 pictures to show how lighting makes the dress looks.


Loved this dress! Got a ton of compliments on it! Had a black and white themed wedding so I got the white petticoat to go underneath and I'm glad I did, as I was unsure if it would look silly. Paired with a white belt and pearls couldn't go wrong.


Was really excited about this dress and the beautiful green color green on screen I looked at it for about a week waiting to see a review on the green color finally one posted and said it was this color and not olive as another had said, and I'd say it's more of a tree green, I was really hoping this would be emerald green like the picture and it took quite a few pictures to capture the true color even in the same room the color changes in the camera lens. It does fit really well and I could have actually fit a large with the amount of stretch but I figured be safe with the measurements as some said it fit exact. I measure, 43/36/48 I'm the brunette in the pictures, my mother is 46/38/42 and it fit her as well. I'm still debating on returning hoping the green will grow on me if not I'm thinking maybe replacing it with the black even though I really didn't want another black dress honestly it seems like that's all I buy. Also something I may have missed in other reviews the seller stated free shipping but I was charged shipping not a deal breaker but just be honest about it.


I ordered this dress for our 50s inspired batman villains costumes. The dress is a perfect green for Poison Ivy. The dress is well made and ill definitely be wearing it to other places. Maybe even to work. I love it! I am 5'9" and a size 14 in most clothes. I ordered the large and it fits wonderfully. I'm also a 34G bra size and top is very flattering.


This fits great!! I am a busty girl (34DD) ..and have alot of curves(thick thighs,big butt). I am also 5'9" so usually dresses are way too short on me. This dress however, is a perfect length. But i do feel if someone is below 5'4" it would look kinda too long. The material is stretchy! I ordered a medium which is my true dress size...and was happy to see it fit great and stretches. Very pretty colors..all around would suggest to buy without a doubt!


I love this dress. I attended a gala with a 50's theme, and this was perfect. I ordered a medium...it said it was a 6- I'm a solid 8...but this was a little bigger than I thought it would be. Still fit- but could have been snugger. It also would have fit better if I'd had the chest to fill it in. ğŸ˜‰ Also- get the pedi coat- way cuter with one!


I would have loved to give this 5 stars, however, there was one minor seam imperfection. It's as if the thread wasn't long enough and it was just left as is. I'll have a pic to show. Other than that minor thing, the dress is great and I can fix the seam myself Super cute and I love how stretchy the fabric is. A little more casual than the picture actually looks, but still really cute. I can't wait to top it off with a petticoat underneath.


Update. The dress worked out fabulously after I fixed that seam issue. I decided against the petticoat. All in all the dress was wonderful. Loved it.


I was looking for a dress to wear to an upcoming wedding.  I checked all the big department stores and pretty much hated everything I saw.  So, I turned to Amazon figuring...why not?!  This dress popped up and I poured through almost all of the reviews. I was skeptical but figured it was worth a shot, worst case scenario would be that I returned it or gave it away.  I LOVE this dress! After consulting the reviews and the size guide in the description I went with an XL.  I'm somewhere between a 12-14.  The XL fits almost perfectly! Now, it is stretchy as some other reviews say, but I was worried that if I did order I size down that it would be just a little too tight for my liking. Also, if there are any other tall women out there looking at this, I'm 6'3 and this hits just above my knee.  So, I can wear it out in public without any wardrobe gaffes.  My only complaint is that the Light Sea Green color is a little darker than I expected, but it's not enough of an issue to justify a return.


I've included a picture. Now, it is a bit wrinkly, but I had just taken it out of the packaging.  The tag also says hand wash(loooolz) or dry clean, so I'm pretty sure once that's done it'll look even better. Also, the lighting in my bathroom is terrible, I said the Light Sea Green is darker than I expected, but it's not as dark as the picture.


Update: I'm so crazy about this dress I bought another one.  This time, I bought the "Beige" which is really more of a Peach or Coral. It fits just like the first one. So, I have no complaints! I just need to get it to the dry cleaners.


It is a beautiful dress, I love it!
