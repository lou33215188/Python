Oh man, i didn't expect the quality of fabric to be so good npr it to fit so perfectly.  For this price I expected much less.  I think i found my new favorite party dress!  Need to order a few more colors.


I am 5/7 about 190 pounds and the 14-26 fit perfectly!  Love it!


I love this dress! Exactly how it was described, photographs beautifully!


Beautiful dress, fits as expected. Fabric is not my favorite but looks great! Will buy from seller again.


Wow! Super impressed with this dress, nice lightweight material. Soft and not itchy, love that it has some stretch. I am a 10/12 with a 40" bust and ordered the L and this fit like a glove. Love it, I am ordering it in different colors!


super cute, didn't fit.


Great buy, beautiful. Well made dress.


The same as i rateIHOT the fitting is ferfict


The fit was perfect as was the color.  It's a great dress to dance in!


Very pretty! The material isn't very heavy, so it will be good to wear in the summer. Be cautious about pulling the dress into place, though. A seam pulled when I was adjusting it.


The dress was delivered very fast, which was great!
