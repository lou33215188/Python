I loved this dress. Came write on time for my college graduation! I order a 2xl just to be on the safe side but very happy with my purchase. I felt like the bell of the ball lol


fit great! the size chart was perfect and the yellow is beautiful! Arrived fast very thick and sturdy material.


Gorgeous dress and great quality; fits as expected. Reason for 4 stars is that it arrived with the pleats across the chest area completely messed up, such as unaligned with each other and folded incorrectly in some areas. Had to take it to a dry cleaner to get them re-iron the pleats. Other than that, the dress is stunning.


This dress is perfect. I followed the sizing chat listed and got a 2XL even though I wear size 14US. I was a little worried about the bust size since I'm 42" and the 2XL was listed as 41.5" butt the fabric is very forgiving and stretches. It isn't too tight and looks amazing. I may have to buy other colors.


Beautiful dress!


The dress is lovely and fits perfectly.  I wear a 34 DDD and am a size 10, normally, so I ordered a large and it was exactly the right size.


Was a little disappointed that it shrank a little in the cleaning process. Hand wash in cold water and line dry. Material shrank. So be careful. Tag on dress gave those instructions. So be careful!


My wife loves this dress, fits like a glove, looks great anywhere, timeless design.
