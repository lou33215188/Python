I love this dress and get a lot of compliments anytime I wear it. Fits great.


Dress looked great but it didn't fit Amazon returns are the best.


Dress is not white as shown in picture. Is a very yellow cream colored dress!


I loved this dress but it was too big for me and I am too short to wear something like this. sadly, I had to return it.


I bought this dress in black to wear to a Christmas Party.  It fit great and I felt great wearing it.  I plan to buy this dress in other colors.


It's an okay dress. Not as pretty as the picture. Size runs true. Color is same. But it ripped as soon as I put it on and tugged at it. Seems cheaply made compared to what I paid for it.


Beautiful...always receive so many compliments!!!


LOVE the quality and fit! Would be more in different colors


Fits good , nice dress


I love this dress! I'm 5'7", 34in waist and DD bra and got an XL. It fits pretty much perfectly, but I probably could have gotten a large. The fabric is sturdy but pretty stretchy so if you are big chested like me no worries.
