looks a lot less nice in real life then online


Love the quality and fit! It's the perfect dress for Dapper Day! Will be ordering from this company again!


Love it!!!  I've paired it with a hot pink patent leather belt and hot pink pumps - AWESOME!  :)


Beautiful dress.  Nice heavy, stretchy fabric.


Loved it!


Nice dress.


I love the dress and the fabric but I should have ordered small. I also love the length and color. Will return for a smaller size.  The bust construction is great.


The fabric was great. It's a lovely dress.


It fits wonderfully! I was a little nervous at first but when I wore the proper shape wear under it, it looked amazing!


You need to be at least 6 feet tall for this dress to not look ridiculous.  Otherwise very cute.  Not worth paying for alterations on such an inexpensive item.
