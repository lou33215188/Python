quality is so bad, fit is not as indicated


diappointed


Exactly what I was looking for.  Fits as their sizing chart says.  Nice material, fast shipping.


Gorgeous dress, sturdy, and even better in person. It is sexy yet classy.


LOVE LOVE LOVE.


This is just lovely. Very retro and very comfortable, stretchy fabric. I just love it. Feels quality-made.


Nice dress. Looks phenomenal.


I love this dress and it fits like I thought it would. The color is noted as beige but it's more peach which worked perfect for me.


Great dress for a great price!


I figured it would fit a little small, so I ordered a size larger than I normally do.  It fit well. I love the style and color. Very fun.


Very comfortable dress


color was much darker then the picture. the fit was good.
