Beautiful, looks great on. Make sure to look at MUXXN sizing, not Amazon. 5'8", 36C, 175 lbs, I ordered the XL and it fits great.


Love it! I bought these for my bridesmaids' dresses because I wanted something with a vintage feel. It was so pretty that I ended up buying on for myself to wear! It needs a petticoat to make the skirt stand out, and I think adding a belt would be a nice touch.


I really love this dress.  The quality of material is better than what I thought it would be.  I'm 5'3  163lbs.  I ordered an XL it fits perfect.


The color and fit would have been beautiful on someone a size smaller. I typically wear a 16 and ordered the XL. Will switch to the XXL.


I love this dress!!  The material is a stretchy material so you cannot iron it and mine came very wrinkly.  Bit it was comfortable, super cute, and I think I want it in every color.


I love this dress. Most of the reviews say to go up a size. Don't. I did and it is somewhat too big. I have to get it hemmed, but that was my fault. The dress is well made and I want every color!


Got so many compliments on this dress I lost count!


This dress was just as I expected it to be. I got a small and when it came it looked super small but when I put it on it fit just right. I will most definitely wear this dress a whole bunch.


Nice dress. Haven't worn it yet but love the vintage look.


Beautiful looking. Got so many complements
