The dress fits and feels nice! I received a kind of salmon color instead of beige which is great.


This dress was awesome, good quality fabric & a great comfortable fit.


Wrinkles came out easily with a handheld steamer.


Pretty dress, size medium runs large. Had to return. Did not fit. The return was easy and painless.
