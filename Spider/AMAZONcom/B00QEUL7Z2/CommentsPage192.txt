Love the dress . I ordered a larger size than normal based on other reviews now actually wish I had ordered smaller. The material is stretchy which makes it very comfortable and fun to wear. I might order another one in a different color and smaller


I took a chance and bought this for my wife, it fitted her perfectly.


Excellent buy, quick delivery. Exactly as described, fits nicely (true to size). Would buy from seller again. Recommend to friends and family


Fit great!! Heavy material. Would buy again


This was a great choice for Thanksgiving dinner.  I wish I had bought a petticoat along with it.  Material is beautiful as well.  Thanks!


Love it. Fits well and is gorgeous.


I like the material, it wasn't cotton. It was a stretchy material. The zipper did stick but if you pull gently it will work. The waist if a little higher than expected.


I bought this for my girlfriend, and she looks absolutely amazing in this beautiful dress ! Soft, flowing fabric, and twirls so cute ! Def looking into buying more in different colors !


Beautiful dress love it fit perfect very true to size


Dress is gorgeous - well made.  Ran smaller than expected.  Returned and waiting for a size larger to arrive!
