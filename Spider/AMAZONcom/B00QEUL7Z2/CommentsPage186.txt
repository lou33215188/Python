This fit our daughter exactly and she loved it.  It was exactly what she was looking for a formal dance.


This dress is so lovely. It has some twirl, so it's extra fun for dancing. I can't wait to wear it to multiple events and play with accessories.


This is a great dress!!  Very pretty and a perfect fit.  I got compliments on this dress when I wore it.


I read reviews that said order a size smaller, and I'm so glad I listened!  I ordered a large, and I'm 5'7" large frame, and it fits BEAUTIFULLY!!  I am so very thrilled at the quality and fit that I am going to order a few more!  I also ordered a petticoat for underneath to make it fuller, and I can't believe how feminine and lovely I feel!  I highly recommend this dress.  I can zip it myself no problem.


Beautiful


It fit perfectly and am very satisfied.


Overall I am very happy with this dress I only wish it had a built in slip to make the full skirt effect. But it is a beautiful dress.


Wore this to a Go Red for Women event, and got a million compliments! Great find and the price was amazingly reasonable!


I was expecting to have to send it back but pleasantly surprised how good it fit.  It's ability to stretch added to the nice fit.  Checking out other reviews also was a big help in what size to order.


Nice thick material. The bodice ran long, I would have needed a petit
