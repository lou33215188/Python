Love the dress, but I need to return and get a smaller size though.

My wife loves this dress!


I love the dress fits and looks great. the sleeves are too short but not a big deal.


Great looking dress, fits good.


I am absolutely glad that I ordered this dress. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the material. Its kind of stretchy, but not that crappy stretch material. I am glad I read the reviews first, as you definitely want to order down a size. I am a 14-16, and the large was just right. I also ordered a petticoat, and it really added that extra touch to the dress. There is a seam that almost runs down the center of the dress skirt, but it gets hidden for the most part in the folds. There are also a seam around where the top and skirt meet, but again it looked fine. Per the reviews I did order a belt just in case. I was worried because the belt was not going to make it in time for me to wear it to my event. My friends said it looked fine, and it did. The seam wasn't as noticeable, but then again I got the black one. This dress is very flattering to all body types. I will definitely order more from this designer.


Was surprised how well it fit! Very happy :)


It fits perfectly. Love the dress style
