Luv this dress fit perfect for my event


The color didn't match that is on the web site. Just a little disappointed in that.


Love, love, love this dress! I now own it in two colors!


Perfect


The dress is a lot longer than expected; it works on me, since I am 5'10" and can pull it off. My sister, who is considerably shorter than I, ordered the same dress and it did not work on her.


I like this dress and the way it fit.


Fits as Expected. I am a busty girl, so I had to get a larger size. But everywhere else on me I was a smaller one. The stretching as of the dress forms fits and I look fabulous!


Perfect!! Didn't expect much, since I've been disappointed by buying clothes online before, but this dress fits as if it were MADE for me! I'll DEFINITELY buy from this dressmaker again!


Gorgeous dress love it I have worn this dress to weddings and nights out, it is my go to dress for any occasion!


Loved it, looked great for a wedding!
