Great dreess!


Absolutely beautiful dress. Everything I was hoping for.


It fit me a bit too large, but it is great quality! Luv it!


I hope my boyfriend likes it as much as I do :)


Fits great.


Fits good looks nice


Perfect for me.


I am 5'7, 129 lbs. 34C. 27 waist. I got the size small. It fit, but because its stretchy, it has a little bit of give. It definitely hid my figure. It's a beautiful dress, but I felt like a little girl playing dress up in mom's clothes. If they offered an XS, I think it would have fit much better! I really wanted to love it! And I think it would be great for those that are just a bit bigger, or have bigger chests! It's a lovely dress. Just not for me.


Fits perfect but smelled like cigarets when I took it out of packaging...


It fits great!
