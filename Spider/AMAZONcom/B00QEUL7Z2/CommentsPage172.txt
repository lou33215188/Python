Beautiful, got lots of compliments.  I ordered a petticoat to get the full effect.  Fabric has a slight stretch and is very comfortable.


One of my favorite dress purchases on Amazon! Color was correct to image and fit really nicely.


Loved the fabric.


I love love this dress. I bought the yellow and purple. They are true to the color. The fabric is a little strechy. It is also long,it goes below my knees which I love because now a days you cannot find a decent dress. I  am 5'6 and I weigh between 142-145.


The 2xl fits my size 20 self wonderfully. Very comfortable as well.


Love this dress. I'm a 36DD with big hips and an average sized waist and I feel a Large rather than XL would fit more comfortably. The fabric is forgiving and stretches a little.


This dress is made of a heavy cotton fabric. It was a bit too long for me and the chest area was not flattering for me. I felt like the dress was heavier than I expected so I will be returning it.


Really great fit and vibrant color!


I love this dress! It is so cute and it's slightly stretchy so it's really comfortable!


Beautiful dress with a made-for-me look. I did order a small even though I normally wear a medium, after reading the reviews about size.
