It looked cute in the picture, But when I tired it one I left like I was wearing a bag or a moo-moo!!!


Runs big. Trying to shrink it by placing in washer.


It fit perfectly. I love it so much.


Very comfortable


It fits as expected thought it would be lighter material but it's nice


Fits great. A little long for current styles but perfect for a 50's era dress.


I love it, but the fabric is pretty thick, not what I was expecting from a 'summer' dress!


This dress is BEAUTIFUL! The fit is right on! I want to buy one in every color!


It was as decribed


The dress has a lovely flow to it and stretches in all the right places.
