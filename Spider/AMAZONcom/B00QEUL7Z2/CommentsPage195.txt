Great dress. fits as expected.  It looks better with a petticoat!


Dress is great but the pleats across the bust don't lay flat.  They stick out, so this dress is going to be returned.


Great Dress will buy again....


Great dress! Came well packaged. The  color is spot on and the dress is comfy! It's stretchy too. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly. I normally wear a 4-6. Going to be buying more for my bridesmaids!!


I love the style. I love the fit. I love material. I love everything about this dress!


Showed up on time, color is true to picture online, fits great! Does not feel cheap. Greatly looking forward to wearing this to my cousins wedding and to other occasions in the future!


The dress is great but the fabric is a little cheaper than I would have expected. The fit is too large and wide.


Good quality fabric and weight. Super flattering cut. And very cute!


perfect


The dress is too small and since it's for a wedding, I didn't want to take a chance on another one.  Sent it back for a refund.
