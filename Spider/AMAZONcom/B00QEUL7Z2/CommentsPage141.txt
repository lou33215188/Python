Color and quality is great.  Definitely worth $30!


Fits great, love it! Im a size 4 and ordered the small, fits great!


Love the dress, just a bit small in bust area. Returned and ordered in next size. Looking fowsrd to wearing it.


LOVED the dress!!!! the fit was Fabulous!! However, the zipper was broken/or broke when trying on. So disappointing. There was no way for me exchange it either. Was able to return it without any problem for full refund. Hoping the zipper was a fluke, because the dress itself was wonderful. Not willing to reorder to see.


Absolutely gorgeous dress!


I was so excited when my dress came in and I was not disappointed when I opened it and tried it on! It fit great and I love that the material is a bit stretchy. I most definitely recommend getting a petticoat, it makes the dress look 10 times better. You won't regret this dress, I don't.


Beautiful dress.


It's georgeous.  I feel very pretty in it.  It accentuates the curves very nicely.


I love this dress very pretty I am 5 foot 5 170 so I bought a medium, following other reveiws. It's a little big but I am busty and hippy with a small waist, I think the small would fit better but over all love this dress


It fits exactly as expected.


Material is stretchy as well


I love this dress. Will be ordering additional colors.
