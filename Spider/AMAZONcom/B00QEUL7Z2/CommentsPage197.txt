Great dress for a great price


Love the dress! Now, just need to find a sweater to go with.


it was too large I ended up giving it to my friend and it fits her perfect


This dress is adorable. The fabric is stretchy so it seems to run a little big, but love it.


Buy a size smaller. I wear medium but I got the small and the fit is a little bit snug but perfect. I'm 136 lbs. 5'2" tall. Fabric is not bad for the price. Can be worn as cocktail dress too.


Nice dress, came very wrinkled but otherwise nice.  Good fit.


This was a beautiful dress.  The material was of high quality and stretchable.  Had to return this dress because it was somewhat large and the dark green didn't go well with my skin tone.


Love, love, love this dress! Have gotten many compliments. Washes well.


If youâ€™re big busted, not a good fit.


nice
