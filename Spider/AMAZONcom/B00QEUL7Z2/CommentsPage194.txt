Nothing but compliments for this dress!  As others have said it's pretty stretchy so you can get away with the smaller size if you're in between.


This was a beautiful dress and fit perfectly.  The dress was purchased to wear to a wedding.  I was embarrassed when the trim came apart from the sleeve.  I wish it was made better because I really loved the dress.


Absolutely beautiful! Fits well and is very flattering. It's made well and is good quality! Based on other reviews I got a size smaller than I originally planned to order and it fit perfectly.


Sizing is off. They are beautiful but keep that in mind. Also they have a lot of stretch. I was able to fit 3 different size girls all into size smalls.


This was such an excellent buy. It is of high quality, fits perfectly to size, elegant, cute gorgeous. Amazon Prime is also excellent I received the dress three day in the Caribbean after it was shipped. Excellent


My 14 year old daughter picked this as her 8th grade graduation dress.  When it arrived she couldn't wait to try it on.  She looks beautiful in this dress! Fits perfect and the material is very nice.


I got more compliments on this dress than any I've ever had!  Love love love!


Dress was beautiful.  More than I expected. I'm top heavy so the stretch  of the fabric made it fit prefect.


I wore this dress in yellow for Easter Sunday and I have never had so many people stop me an compliment my outfit before. I bought a full petticoat slip to wear under it and it was so fun.


It is not for someone with big boobs and a smaller waist. Sadly I had to buy it for my bust size and it looked enormous at my waist. If you are a hour glass figure stay away!
