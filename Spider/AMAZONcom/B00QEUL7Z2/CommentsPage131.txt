The material is nice and stretchy, but thick enough to cover any lines.  The front of the top has pleats that need to be tacked into place.  The dress looks really nice on and is extremely comfortable!


This dress is nice, it's just disproportionate for my style, almost perfect at the shoulders and bust but too big around my waist by about two inches. In my opinion, this would be killer cute if it had a tighter waist for me.


Very flattering. The color and shape of the dress was beautiful. I've worn it several times and always received compliments.


Fits perfectly and so comfortable!


I ordered for my granddaughter and she loves it


Loved this dress! Bought it for me and my fianc√©'s date night. Great length (just below the knee) and good material. Wasn't scratchy or anything. The material is a little stretchy and kind of a heavy material so there was room to fit in. I got a lot of compliments on it.


pretty small


Lovely dress. Fits as expected.


It's a great dress, I love the fabric, but definitely needs a tulle if you want to give it the retro 50s look.


Favorite dress I own! Going to mystery themed dinner that is 50s glamour in October... This dress not only is extremely flaterig it has quality material. Going to wear it to a few wedding this August too because it looks so nice
