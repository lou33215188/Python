The dress was really pretty, but I had to return it as it was somewhat large (I ordered the smallest size).


Thank you! It was perfect!


Super cute. It's a little big but still wearable.  Will be ordering more!


Beautiful dress but it runs very small.  High quality material with a back zipper.  I had do return it


It is a beautiful dress and it fits really well-I got an XL and Im a size 16 and DD. I haven't worn it out yet, but the material is think and feels well made!


Good quality, fit perfectly.


This dress is a stunner. I'm 5'8" 150 lbs and Medium fits beautifully. Black is a little smaller than the white with dots, but both fit like a glove. It's definitely stretchy and forgiving-- not as tight as Spanx, more like stretchy jeans. The fabric is substantial.


I must admit in the photo the dress looks so chic I was anxiously waiting for its arrival. When I got the dress it fit okay but the material was cheap. You can see through the dress.


I was happy in every way. The color the fit the compliments! I'm 5'10 and wear a size 8 in a dress. I ordered the medium and am very happy with the fit.


This dress just arrived - it's great! Fits perfect, material is high quality. I'm 5'9" - 135 lbs - got the medium.
