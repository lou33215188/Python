The dress fits perfectly! True to size and cut/fabric very forgiving. Very flattering and feel like I've stepped out of a Mad Men episode. Totally worth the purchase!


Great dress!  I got so many compliments.  I had to return the XL and get a size L (but is that really a bad thing?) I am buying another color soon!


As a 40DD I thought the XL would fit, sadly the bust of the dress was being stretched against chest. If you have a large bust I recommend going a size up.


Beautiful dress, fits as expected.


Loved this dress. I am short and it was very elegant. I received numerous compliments. Great buy


Very happy with this purchase! Dress fits like a glove. Excellent quality and very fast shipping. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a simple 50s style dress.


Small was too big I m 5'4 130lb so I had to return it . Great style awsome fabric. Nice deep red.


Looks gorgeous on.  With or without a petticoat.


Awesome dress and made great !! A little long but still perfect !


I really liked this dress. The material is stretchy which is nice. I would recommend buying the petticoat to go under. The dress arrived a day late. Other than that i love this dress.
