Love this dress. I got the burgandy and its gorgeous. I was so scared ordering it online. Shipped fast, fit perfect. I'm a 14/16 and ordered a large. One of my favorite purchases from amazon!


looks and fits good a little low we will have to add a lace insert to prevent falling out of it but a great dress


It's thick great material. Little longer than what I wanted but very conservative and perfect for church and a tea party!


Adorable, quality made, I have this in black too, fits perfectly, adorable 50's style dress...you'll need to iron it though!


I have ordered this dress twice. The first time, the zipper broke after only wearing it a few hours. When I ordered it again, the dress arrived with a broken zipper. Not good quality.


This dress was perfect. I got a 25  inch petticoat to wear under it for extra floof. Easily my favorite dress.


Good dress, good color. It did come a little wrinkled, and will need some ironing before my wife wears it. The sleeves are not as wide as we originally thought they would be. Overall, a good dress.


I have received so many compliments on this dress!


This dress is a great dress. Would probably look better with a petticoat, but I haven't tried that yet. I am 5 feet, 140 lbs, 36b. The dress is a little big in the boobs area, but fits wonderfully in the waist and everywhere else. It's tea length with no petticoat. Arrived in great condition, not wrinkled like other posters have suggested. I can't wait to wear it out.


I ordered a size up as a just in case. It was a little loose in some spots, but fit my bust perfectly. I always prefer a more comfortable fit to a loose one. But the fabric is super stretchy and very comfortable. The trim on the end of the dress is a nice touch. Enjoyed this purchase!
