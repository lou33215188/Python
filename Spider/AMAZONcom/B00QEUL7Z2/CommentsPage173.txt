I absolutely love this dress. Quality fabric and good design. It looks very high end designer wear. I can't believe I only Paid $40 for it.


Love it.


This dress so so comfortable and beautiful! So happy! Thank you! Turned out great for our Christmas festivities.


This dress lived up to the reviews!  The price is unbeatable and my sister and I wore this same dress to a wedding and got tons of compliments!  Very comfortable and I will wear this again for sure!!!


My daughter loved this dress and wore it for her graduation.  The color was perfect.  We were concerned because the color is listed as beige but in reality it is exactly as it is shown more peach color and that is what we wanted.


The dress fits perfectly!!! I purchased a size small/ 4 US. I am between sizes 4 -8 depending on the brand. I have a small waist and I'm curvy on the bottom. This style and cut was a great match for my dimensions plus I got many compliments.


A great fit, and cut. Cant wait to wear it outside!


Bought for my daughter's school dress. Absolutely stunning. Very classy. Excellent quality. Highly recommend.


Asked for white got off white. Like the way it's made. The material not so much. Better suited for cooler climates


I love this dress so much. It is very flattering, and the best type of dress for my figure. The circle skirt is absolutely perfect for twirling and dancing (just make sure you have full coverage underwear).
