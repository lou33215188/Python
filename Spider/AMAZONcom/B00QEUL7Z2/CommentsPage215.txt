Really nice, unique material. Stretchy and super comfy. The green color is a nice deep green, not too bright. Love the flare of the skirt. Will probably order in another color sometime soon.


I'm between a size 2-4. This dress is so cute! It fits great and is comfortable. The fabric is a little stretchy which is nice. Great dress for the dollar.
