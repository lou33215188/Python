Perfect dress! Lovely color and fit great. Only wish I had picked up a petticoat, but that was my forgetfulness!


I bought this for my daughter, who is 5'4" and 110 lbs and usually wears a size 6.  I got an 8 and it fit perfectly.  So, I'd order one size larger than you normally wear in order for it to fit properly.


It fit me perfect and I followed the size chart they provided. It's stretchy so it's not to tight and it flows really nicely. It's adorable while still being modest.


We got this for a play my daughter is in and it is perfect.  The sizing was exactly as the chart stated.  The price is right.  The quality is fantastic.  I will definitely buy from this vendor again.


great fit, this is a second purchase in a second color.  This red a a deep, rich, classy color.


Fits perfect! Drapes very well and beautiful color!


Nice material, well made, very pretty color. Overall lovely dress. Unfortunately size small was too big for me. Im 5'9" and about 145 lbs (fit) 34 bust and 26 inch waist. Due to the fact it looks perfect on my mother I am still very happy with the purchase!


I bought this dress and the second time I tried it on the zipper broke. Very disappointed that I had to take the dress somewhere to have the zipper fixed


Beautiful dress, with high quality fabric. I ordered my standard size, but the dress was too large. I ended up taking in the bodice to make it fit better, but for the price I am very pleased with this purchase.


Purchased as a  bridesmaids dress and it is perfect. I added a black sash and a black petticoat to give it a more finished look and it is beautiful!
