Cute and very flattering.


Color not as advertised and material not good.


Looks great but the stitching was a bit poor in some areas and needed work before it could even be worn the first time. Looks classy on and makes a nice impression.


Not white as selected. Is a off-white color


The dress is absolutely gorgeous. It ran a tad to big. I'm 5 foot 4 185lbs and the xxl just didn't fit right. I returned it and got a smaller size. I'll update my review when I get the other dress later on today.


Update: The smaller size fit perfect. There is a little stretch to the dress and so it was perfect. The only suck is that there was a hole in the dress. Very, very small but it was where the zipper zipped up and every time I tried to zip it up the zipper would get stuck in the hole. I ended up taking the dress off and zipping it up just past the hole and then putting the dress back on. But all in all I absolutely loved the dres.


Great quality and is true to size. I bought to wear as a costume, but nice enough to wear out. Very pleased with cost and quality . Previous reviews were on point.


I love this dress! It is so versatile! It can be dressed up or down and looks good for any occasion. I wore it for a country style wedding with a belt, boots and a hat and it was super cute! Great buy for the price!


I am using this dress for a theatre production of West Side Story. It is PERFECT. The lycra in the fabric is great the cut is flattering. I would order this dress again.


The material was a lot thicket and heavier that I was expecting


can't wait to wear this dress.
