Love this dress!! I ordered according to the sizing guidelines, and it fits as if it were made just for me!! Looking forward to wearing it on my upcoming cruise.


Stretchy material that feels heavenly, but for enough to show my curves!! Hubby loves it!


Never sure if sizes when ordering online, I ordered 2 of these. A M and a L. They both fit as expected, but I opted for the L.


This is such a lovely, lovely dress! Fits beautifully and is flattering all over!


This dress what GORGEOUS. I received many compliments on it. Very flattering.


The quality of the fabric, the color is gorgeous(teal).  It appeared a dark green in the photo, but I love the actual better!


LOVE IT! I cut the stuff off the bottom which was quick and easy...than it was much more me. I wore it to chaperone the prom. I've had 3 babies in 4 years...made me feel great!


Love this dress!! Nice amount of stretch to make it comfortable, fits perfectly, and the color matches the photos rather than color listed ( peach rather than beige), which suits me well.


dress is very nice but xl is too big , I followed the size chart and ordered the size it recommended and the dress is too big. will return and get smaller size. My measurements are 38.5/31/42


The quality of the dress is very well made. However I am normally an XS and this dress was too big in the bust area. I am normally a 32A. The front of the dress is WAY short but the cut is really cute so long as it fits your body style.


It fits perfect! I would normally order an L/XL but when ordering this I ordered a XXL. I would suggest checking the measurements and going with what you think might work best. I think I could fit better in an XL but I'm still extremely happy with what I chose and the size I picked.


Also when I placed the order I did the two day shipping, I had no problems and arrived at the expected day.
