This is a beautiful dress. I wore it for my graduation today and it was a big hit. It fit me perfectly, hugged my curves in all the right places and was well worth the investment. It also shipped on time and I had no problems whatsoever with this dress.


We used this dress on stage.  It was lovely heavy flowing fabric and a great deal for the price


Love! Super cute wore it for Halloween but will be wearing again.


Wore to a holiday party, very flattering 50's feel. I'm 185-195 5'10 and a large fit me.


Absolutely beautiful. I love this dress a lot,. I will order another color. The fit and feel of the fabric is very nice. I love it and highly recommend it. This is good quality fabric, fit and style,


So cute and I get many compliments on this dress.  The fit is perfect.


I ordered an XL at first because I'm used to things running small, but exchanged it for a medium and it fits great! It's super stretchy and good heavy material.  I'm actually using it as a bridesmaids dress.


Fits perfectly


This dress is made well! I ordered medium after reading reviews on how material stretchy. It's perfect fit. I'm 37, 29,39. Double DD and fits amazing.


I was reluctant to buy a dress online because it seemed to good to be true but I must say I love the dress and will be buying more!!!!
