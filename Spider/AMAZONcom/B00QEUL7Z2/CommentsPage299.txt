I love It!


Great dress, used for 50s party with a petticoat also purchased here.  Not sure I would wear it anywhere else as the material is a stretchy, sort of cheaper looking knit.  But great for a theme party.


fit me perfectly -- based on the other reviews I got the Small (usually I wear an 8 or 10)-- and since it's on the stretchy side worth getting smaller rather than larger. The green is a hunter green, not emerald. If you are bigger busted, it will work also as there's a lot of fabric in the bodice.


The breast area looks funny. The material is a good stretch; however, it is too big and long. I'm 5'0". This dress is definitely made for tall and chubby women and not for the petites. I am returning this.


Its a nice dress.  I love the color (navy blue).  I runs super big because it has a lot of stretch in it.  Also one thing that I didn't care for was in the bust area.  It seemed like it was pushed them down like towards my stomach (maybe flattening), not exactly how to explain exactly, but it definitely wasn't flattering.


Quality sewing, purchased w/petticoat. Very satisfied. Only thing is I'm 5'3 so it's little long (very minor). Will purchase from vendor again


looked awful


Fit me a bit big in the waist, but still....I loved this dress. Can't wait to wear it again!


This dress is great! I'm 5'10 and 160, slender and  the dress was slightly large but not uncomfortably or noticeably so. When O order this dress again, I'll go down a size.


I paired it with a cerulean blue petticoat, a blue belt and accessories and the colors complimented each other quite well.


The material is legit; doesn't look or feel cheap. This is one of my most beautiful dresses yet.


Had to return it
