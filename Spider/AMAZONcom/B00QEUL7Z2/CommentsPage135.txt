This dress is so flattering, hangs nicely and is just a great dress!! If you are considering this, you should go ahead and get it cause you will love it!!!


Love the dress, the cut is very flattering, nice thick material and every thing seems to be stitched together well. I'll probably order a second dress in another color.


great dress - lovely fit - even if a bit big - but hey who doesn't want a little big ;) the colors however in appearance and description are very different - i.e the peach dress pictured is labeled beige but is indeed peach - and the turquoise is that light blue as pictured - I would go by the pic not the description


Too big and didn't look like what it does on here


This dress doesn't fit me perfectly.  And, I am 5'1, the skirt is too long for me.


Love the style, fit, color and quality of this dress. Planning to wear on Easter.


I wore this to my senior prom and felt very vintage! Absolutely loved it :) It was comfortable and fit very well. I was worried about the length because I'm very short (5'1"), but it was perfect.


Great stretchy fabric. Doesn't feel cheap. The pleats overs the cheast were not seen flat so some minor adjustments have to be done. A bit longer than I expected but still an amazing deal for a nice dress!


I wore this dress to my grandson's wedding. It is the right color, the right style, and it fits perfectly I took lots of pictures and got lots of compliments on this dress.


Absolutely love it!  Did go back and buy a petticoat and now it looks perfect. Love the color love the style
