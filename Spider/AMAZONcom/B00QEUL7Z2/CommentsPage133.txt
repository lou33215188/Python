This dress would have been perfect for my friends wedding but I fell in love with another style more. It's great quality and is just snug enough for it to give form.


I 'm absolutely disappointed.. I'm Bust 34 DD . Waist 32 . Hips 43. And Height 5'2 So I ordered XL .


Because it was closest to the measurement chart.. I confuse , but I will get it fixed by my local seamstress.


Cute dress.  The size two was a little big as I am 5'9", 125#, 27"waist.  There is a lot of stretch so a size smaller (if they made it :( ) would have been perfect.  There is a gap across the top as I don't fill out the top.  Definitely a dress made to complement curvier figures.  I am keeping it anyway.


Beautiful dress. Can't wait to dance with my handsome husband on our upcoming cruise!


The material is comfortable and stretchy. But my biggest problem is that I ordered WHITE, but it is a cream color.  I needed WHITE! So I will most likely return it. Very pretty dress though.


The dress runs a little larger compared to other brands and I was able to buy a size smaller than usual.  It has a great fit and very nice fabric that has stretch to it, but holds its shape well.


I bought it for my daughter's wedding and got tons of compliments and lots of questions as to where I bought it.  It is a beautiful dress and I am going to buy it in other colors.


Love this dress! Get a lot of compliments on it when I wear it. Material is sturdy and shipping was quick!


I am a size 6, with 37-27-36 measurements. The dress fits horridly on me, and reaches my lower calf, even though im 5'6". I'm very disappointed as I bought the dress in a large, and it fit wretchedly,


I loved this dress! The material was so comfortable and the dress was really pretty! I received a lot of compliments on it. It fit perfect.


The bust was too small.
