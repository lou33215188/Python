I wanted to say that you get what you pay for, but I have much better dresses for cheaper. The material is too stretchy for this kind of dress. It is cheap, the color is boooring (dark blue), the zipper was broken upon arrival, will be going back ASAP. Probably would fir as expected, if I was able to close the zipper.


I want one in EVERY COLOR!!!


Love this dress! Got so many compliments.


Loved this dress its cute and classy not revealing at all.

I absolutely love, love, love this dress! It fit perfect. Totally better than I expected for the price. Great buy!!

I'm amazed at the quality and fit.  I LOVE it.  I'm going to get it in a few more colors.


I liked it a lot


I wore this to my prom and it was a big hit! I wear it all the time; it's a very well liked dress and I imagine it would work for most figures.
