way to big but loved the dress


A little bigger and longer than expected but very nice.

I love this dress! I'm usually a size 12 and the Large fit perfectly.


The dress fits perfectly. The color is beautiful.


very much beautiful! I like so much


I'm using this dress for a Disney wedding. I think it's cute and fun. Not sure I would wear it other than that.


This is perfect! Comes just below the knees on me.. Also very stretchy material. Fits like a glove and very comfy!


Dress is even better than expected in person.


very nice
