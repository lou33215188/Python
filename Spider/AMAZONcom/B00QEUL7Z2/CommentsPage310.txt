Fits like a glove the material is very conforming and flattering.  Very feminine and washes up nice.  This is my second purchase of this dress.  I also have it in black.  Love it!!!


Nice but 1 size  too small


The dress fit perfectly! And the color was what I wanted.


Fits great. Had to go down a site from what I normally wear. My mom loves it. It will be for her wedding in March


sturdy material and a good fit.


Darling dress and well-made, especially for the price.  Would purchase again!


simplicity of this dress dominates any kind of party or gatherings I attend to, this is really amazing


I ordered blue and it is a lively shade of blue in person. I wore this during a family gathering and I got compliments on it. Really, really nice.


Size was spot on! Quick delivery and was exactly what the ad advertised


Love the fit of this. The color is so pretty and the fabric is so comfy
