Lovely and the fit is perfect for someone who doesn't stay the same size because of swelling or gains and looses weight easily!


I absolutely love this dress...It fits comfortably and makes you just feel great.  I have bought three dresses in this style now different colours and plan to buy more.


Gorgeous quality but wickedly too small. Very sad.


As soon as I tried on this dress I fell in love it is comfortable and makes me feel good I'm my skin. It highlights the body parts you want to show and hides the ones you wanna hide.


Fell apart and the fabric pilled after only a few wears. It fit great and had nice a stretch to the fabric.


I am 5'5" and 150 lbs. I purchase this dress in a medium and it fits very well. Also the fabric of the dress feels nice. I think this dress is better suited for someone with a large chest, though I am small chested and the dress still looked pretty good.


The dress fits me perfectly except that it is a little long on my legs and I will have to have it tailored a little bit but because it came in super fast and I have plenty of time for that now!


I think I will be able to dance all night in it since it is so comfortable.


The dress is nice, but you do need the right bra for it. I could not fill the chest area as it needed. If you are smaller chested, like me, you may need the right under garments to make it work.


Really nice dress.  Prettier than pictured.  Ran a tiny bit on the larger size but not so much that we couldn't wear it.  Better a bit large than too small.  Great buy!


Very pretty.
