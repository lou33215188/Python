Was perfect for what I needed it for - a bit more flared/full than I expected but nonetheless, still a great buy.


Love this dress! Color was as expected,  fit and quality are great. The zipper had a bit of an issue  going up and down (on me and when hanging it up)..had that "stuck" feeling.  Would recommend this dress to all!


This is a super cute dress. I'm in between a lg and xl. I took a chance and got the lg. Would have fit perfectly if material had give in it. The bust area was way to small. I wear a 38 DD


Nice dress!


For the exception of the dress being a little big on me and the waist that seems to be sewn a little too high the dress material is nice the look of it is great will take up the dress in sides where it's running large get a wide enough belt to cover waist seam.I like this dress thinking about buying another this time a 2x instead of a 3x


Beautiful


Very pretty dress BUT my daughter had it on 5 minutes and we noticed that where the zipper is sewn to the dress is already pulling apart. The dress is not tight on her in any way so it isn't due to that at all.

I ordered this dress for a Kentucky Derby themed bridal shower. I received so many compliments. I wore a 50s vintage a-line petty coat under it to give it a flare.


I loved this dress!  My sister and I dressed the same, and it was a big hit.  It was fun to wear, looked nice, and with the petticoat on, we sashayed around all night.
