Gorgeous. Sizes said to buy an XXL but that was too big. XL is perf.


I'm 5 ft 2'; this dress was a medium and the length was passed the knee which I'd hoped for. The color and pattern was very eye catching. I wore it for New Year's and received very nice compliments:)


it's gorgeous!  the color pops.  only complaint is the belt has no loop so it kind of flaps ones tightened.  otherwise the dress is perfect and looks great


This dress is even more beautiful in person! It's super comfy, but it looks really nice. I opted to not wear the belt bc it was for Easter Sunday, but I might add it the next time I wear it.


Absolutely love this dress! I took the chance and ordered it and got it 2 days before my wedding I was so happy that it fit. I went by the size chart that was provided not amazons size chart


I'm a US size 22/24 and the 3x fits perfect. It's a good length for me (5'10" and hits right below the knee). Great quality, well made, very flattering. I will be buying more in different patterns!


Got this dress for my engagement party. Everyone complimented me on this dress, it fit perfectly, and was very comfortable. I do recommend buying a petticoat for this dress.


Beautiful dress, i wore it for my birthday party and got tons of compliments. Fit perfectly and of good quality


Pretty dress, I'm 5' 6.5", 120 pounds and the small fit nicely. Unfortunately, it did not drop below my knees which for my purpose, I needed it to do. So, I opted to return it. I really wish it was longer because it is a nice dress, good material too!


Beautiful dress. Great quality. Absolutely recommend!


Bought for my 13 year old, would be great on any age. The belt is super long so you can cut as needed. Perfect length.
