Great price and fit. Wish I had more places to wear it.


Fits just as expected. the material is thick enough for the fabric to fall and have volume without wearing a petticoat under it. got this floral print and the black. will be wearing it soon and will post pictures and update once I wear them. will buy more prints and will recommend this dress and seller.


Hi everyone,


I absolutely love this dress, it's beautiful and timeless. I received many compliments. I'm 5'3 & 190lbs and usually wear size 12-14. I ordered a 1X after reading reviews. The dress is somewhat large. I will order the same dress in a different color, next time size 0X.


Thanks


It's ok... material feels like a curtain honestly and a little bit unflattering because makes the waist look bigger than actually is.


Very pretty and fits well.


Looks and feels beautiful.


Fits Levi's size 8 waist. I'm a little big in the chest, so the waist rides high. Might try it with a  sports bra.


Beautiful dress! I wore it for my son's Christening and it looked even better than the stock photos. Very easy to wash and iron.


Wonderful dress!!!


This was a little smaller than I expected, but I really like the style and material.  It's a beautiful dress.
