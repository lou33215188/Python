I love this little classy dress. The fit is perfect and fabric is nice and soft. My only complaint would be that it is a little longer than I expected but overall it looks so stunning that I can ignore the length. Worth buying!


Must be a child's XLarge


LOVED the dress! Is very comfortable and pretty. I received tons of compliments when I wore it on Easter. ğŸ‘� I did not wear the black belt because I felt it looked better without.


There is nothing cheap about this dress except the price!  It fit like a glove, was comfortable and fun.  I did wear a petticoat underneath but Iâ€™m sure it looks great either way.


I am 5'5" and weigh 115 pounds. I ordered the XS and it fits perfect! Love the dress and the way it flows. I will buy more in different colors.


Wore this to a 50s themed 50th birthday party!  It was a hit!!


This dress is a must have, in all patterns!! You donâ€™t need a pettiskirt! Gorgeous!


Lovely


Beautiful!! Small bust area . Order at least one size up


I love this dress. I followed the sizing guide and got the XXL. It's a little bit big but it totally works. It's really nice fabric and well made for the price.
