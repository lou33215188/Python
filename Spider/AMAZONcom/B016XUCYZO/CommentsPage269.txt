This dress is just gorgeous! I added a tutu skirt under to give it an extra poof and bounce and got so many compliments at an Art Show that I was showing my work. You can dress it up with fancy shoes or if you'd like to wear flip flops. Can't wait to wear again!


I love this dress.  I got it for a bridal shower and got some many compliments.  I got the petticoat to go with it.  I normally wear a 6 or 8, but bought a large because the measurements looked right.  It fit perfectly!  I will be buying more dresses from Grace Karin.


LOVED THIS DRESS!! Wore this for my engagement pictures & got lots of good feedback. Love the style, it's very flattering. Fits true to size. Would recommend! (I wore a petticoat under mine to make it more fun).


This dress was too snug for comfort -- I will be reordering the next size up.  I wish it were lined properly!!!


I got it for a mystery party. It worked great!


Perfect fit based on size chart. Very fun dress. We got the XS for my 11 year old school choice concert.


I ordered an XL because ordering off the internet is tricky. I usually wear an 8-10 but this dress fits perfectly as an XL. It's very light and fun to wear, I'll be wearing it to my daughters rehearsal dinner


I’m 5’3 180lbs and the large fit me perfect. Highly recommend getting the crinoline. This is out of the pancaking, so the dress was a bit wrinkly, but nothing an iron can’t fix! The belt is my own- but it did come with a little black one.


This has become one of my favorite dresses!  I got complements on it as I walked down the street.


It was slightly tight on the chest which was fine for me since I don't have a bigger chest, but I could see that as being a problem for other ladies who order larger sizes. Ordered a 16 and fit perfectly, but I am a size B in bras.
