The dress came when expected, in only 2 days on Prime.  I am 5'7 and 130# and the medium fit great.  For the price it is well made and looks great.  I bought the 25" rockabilly petticoat to go under it, and it looks perfect.


Love way looks on my daughter got size bigger thanks to. Comments.


just a bit shorter in skirt length than expected -- but the perfect Salsa dress for Evita


Arrived on time.  Pattern not as expected.  Will be returning.


This product looks amazing on! It covers everything without being too tight. It is a bit thick for summer, but it is absolutely the loveliest summer dress.


Item arrived defective. Tear in the side along seam. Will be sending it back as soon as possible. Materials also seemed extremely thin.


Lovely fabric, stretch cotton. XS fits size 0 daughter perfectly. Waist falls slightly above natural waist. Well constructed. Planning to buy a couple more.


Love the dress, fits loose around ribs but put a thick waist belt on it and fixed he problem. The belt it came with was huge and wrapped around me almost twice but I didn't buy it for the belt I bought it for the lovely colors and the LOADS of complements!


After reading the reviews I decided to order for 2 sizes up and it fits like a glove. I have 3 different colors already and am ordering for more I love the style so much


I like the dress but it arrived with dirty black lines on the back of it. marks on it.
