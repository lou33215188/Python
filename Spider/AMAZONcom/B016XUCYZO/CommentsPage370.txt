Wonderful dress.  Wore it Easter (and Good Friday) and received so many compliments.


I like the dress overall but it was way to big. I looked at the comments and the size chart and opted to go up a size. That was a bad idea. I'm going to send it back and try again with a smaller size.


A very beautiful and well made dress.  My sister loves it and when she wore it, it fit her as expected, perfectly.  The colours were very nice and was as seen in the photo.


This dress is amazing! The fabric breathes and has a little stretch.


It fit great and looked amazing with a TidetellÂ® Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt 26" Length Petticoat under it.


I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments.


No amount of words can tell how much i love this dress. It looked soo good on me even though I'm 5 months pregnant. I can't count the number of compliments i got


Love the fit, super cute!


The dress was perfect! I'll be ordering a few more colors! The size up helped! I'm 5"1 180 lbs and 36 DDD! I like this one even better than the black one I bought! I'll probably buy 1-2 more colors! BUY IT!


Amazing dress. Great fit, style, and comfortable!!


Fit great in the bust. 38D. Little loose on the waist, but the belt helps. Im a size 12/14 and ordered the XL. Neck line was a little too high for my taste, but still cute over all. Good quality material.


Love it!
