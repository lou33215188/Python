I love this dress. It fits perfectly.  Now that I know it's beautifully made, I'll buy others in different colors.


Love love love this dress it was the perfect fit and looks great on!

I love this dress..fits great


Great fit


I wear this dress to work at weddings all the time. The major issue is that this dress collects fuzz and cat hair ( and I don't own a cat) every time I wear it. So if you get this dress be prepared to have lint rollers on hand.


This is a really cute dress


Love this dress everyone ask me how much I paid for it they can't believe the price


This dress was well made, comfortable and fit as expected. There is not enough fabric to support a large bust, so the waistline was a bit higher, but still looked good. When I tired on the dress, it looked more costume-y than I wanted so I returned it.


Still love this but after reading previous posts I got a size larger and I'm glad I did. Love it but the zipper doesn't want to zip good. Something wrong with the zipper itself.
