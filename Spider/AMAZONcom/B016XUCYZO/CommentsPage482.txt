Beautiful dress... Love it!  It is somewhat small and short-waisted, so you may need to select size carefully.


I adore this dress! Very comfortable and looks amazing.


i love my dress it feel good and looked good on me i was the hit of the night thank u very much


The fit was roomy. I am sending it back for a smaller size.


I loved it but I need a larger size I am returning it today


It does crease easily, but it fits very well.


My daughter LOVED IT! Thank you


It's super cute just wish the belt was different. It's way too long.


Fits great, material is nice - I have a hard time shopping for clothes without trying them on so I am very happy with this purchase.


This dress is perfect. I absolutely love it and the way my body looks in it. And with the right shoes it looks amazing. But can youbplease send ne the belt. I thought it came with a belt?
