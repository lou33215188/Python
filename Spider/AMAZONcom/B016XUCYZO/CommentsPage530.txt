Beautiful. I got lots of compliments.


Great quality! Love the belt


I usually wear a Medium and I bought a Large just in case and the top is tight.


Oh my, I LOVE this dress!  The fit was just perfect!!


The dress looks absolutely beautiful on my 14yr old Granddaughter!!! She is wearing it to her Graduation ceremony from Middle School. Can't wait!!!


Very beautiful dres


Dress fitted portly and looked horrible on.


Beautiful dress, I loved it!!!


I loved the dress got a ton of compliments. But i could have ordered a size smaller.


The dress fits well.  I am ordering the petticoat, as I think it will make it even better.
