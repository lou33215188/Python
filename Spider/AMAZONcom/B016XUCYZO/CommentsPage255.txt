Dress exactly as pictured, except I didn't get the belt that the description says comes with it. Fits according to size chart. I'm a size 6 and wore a medium size in this dress. I would have given a 5 ⭐️ rating if it had the belt.


Very cute. This is my 3rd dress by Grace.


Love it...


Oh I wear a large but I bought a XL


Still a little tight around the chest. (38DD)


Beautiful dress!  Awesome price for the quality of the material.  Will order again.


Very pretty dress. Comfortable. My daughter loves it!


Beautiful design. Fabric wrinkles easily though.


I ordered the wrong size. Very nice dress for the price though!


I am 5'6" and around 150lbs. I am more top heavy so I had to get the large. I've never received so many compliments on a dress. Random people at The Rolling Stones were just coming up to me and saying how on point and classic the look was for me. I love Grace Karin dresses. The quality for the price can't be beat.


The dress arrive on time and was worn to a wedding. It was a great fit and the fabric was stretchy enough but still very comfortable. However, when I took the belt out of the package it was broken and missing a piece. Additionally, the holes for the belt were in the middle of the entire belt and not the side. Weird. I wear a usual size 14, 5'5" and about 180lbs with a short torso and longer legs. It fit great.


I bought this dress for my college graduation. Fit great! Super cute and a great price!! I am 5' 6" and 128 lbs and I ordered a small.


Bought to wear to a wedding - fit like a glove! Very fluffy even without tulle underneath.
