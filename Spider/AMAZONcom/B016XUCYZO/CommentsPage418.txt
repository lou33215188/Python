Fits great! Really pleased with this purchase.


I love this dress. Make sure to use the size chart, not the generic Amazon one but the one listed in the pictures. It's super cute with or without the petticoat.

I wore this dress as a chaperone to our school's mother daughter senior tea to celebrate graduating seniors. Both girls and mother loved it and I received many compliments!


Really love this dress. The belt was missing with it but I was refunded 20% they were very apologetic. Anyway...it's beautiful and it came when I expected it to. I would definitely order again.

The size is perfect and the colors are beautiful. I couldn't have wished for a better dressed and is already my favorite in the closet!


Loved this dress! Super durable and super cute. Plan on wearing it underneath my graduation robe for my reception. ğŸ˜�


Dress was what I wanted. Disappointed dress arrived with out belt. Fit well. Had small mildew on wrong side of skirt.


Good flare and decent material for price.
