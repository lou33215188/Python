Terrible product. Not worth the time or money.


Iâ€™m in love with this dress.


LOVE it! Fit's perfect


It's much longer than I would have liked. I also got a Large, because I read some previous comments and it's a bit too big. My dress size was in the medium column on the chart, but I listened to reviews over the chart. Wish I would have gotten a medium! A little big in the top area.


It's a beautiful dress, definitely needs a petticoat.


Just lovely everything about it works, and you will love it!!


I found the dress a little tight in the bust, but I can lose 5 lbs. I should have bumped up a size.


Great Quality! Fit as advertised! Got rave reviews when I wore it out the other day! Love the dress!


Fits as expected.  Great value.


I wore this to a spring wedding! It was very cute and comfortable!
