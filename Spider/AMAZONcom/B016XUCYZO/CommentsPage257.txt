I really like it, but it runs too small. I would have given it a 5 if it wouldn't't for the fit. Also I'm still waiting for the return label.


Great quality. It fit me as expected. True to size. The color is great too. It definitely looks like it came form a high end store. I will be buying a couple more.


I love this designer. I have purchased 4 skirts, which are fabulous and now this dress. The material and stitching are beautiful. I am 127lbs 5'7".  I purchased a small. It fits perfectly. I highly recommend. You won't be disappointed.


This dress is gorgeous!  Bought it for a party my daughter had to attend.  She absolutely loves it.


Love, love, love this dress! So classic and gorgeous! I can’t wait to wear this at my son’s graduation from Marine Corp boot camp!


I had ordered the 1950s vintage style floral dress. And received a pink polkadotted skirt instead.


The waist rides higher than I expected. Nice fabric.


Perfect. I bought 2 and am considering more!


I'm 5'6 165 and 6mos pregnant! I still looked super cute in this dress. Nice weight to material Received a lot of compliments.


Love it. I will buy more
