This is the most beautiful dress I've tried on in a long time.  I feel like Audrey Hepburn when I put it on.  I ordered three dresses for a tap costume, I promised myself I would only keep one.  The dress I chose for the costume is not this one, but I have to keep this one for myself as well.  I hope I have an event to wear it too this Spring.  It is made really well and has great fabric.


Very satisfied.  Received within two days.  Well packaged.  Very good quality fabric and workmanship.  This dress will last many years.  I  am 5'11, large chested (DD), 14-16.  XL is just right.


This is no where near true to size! I wear a 16 and ordered a 2 XL. The zipper does not even meet to zip! I literally would need a 5xl to zip it! I'm very disappointed.


Everything was great, except that the belt seemed like it was made for a size XL instead of a small. There wasn't a hole in the belt that matched the waist size, but I was able to just create a new hole in it.


Cute dress but too large for me.


For the price, this dress is great! Unfortunately, it's too large, and I will have to return. I typically wear a small, but I am about six months pregnant, (5'8", 140 lbs), so I ordered a size up. Also, I worried the fabric would be too thin, but it was not see through when I tried it on.


Love it! Super cute!! I love the high neck and the silhouette of it! Very classy! The sizing is a little off- chose the size I normally am and it's slightly too large but it works. Also the hem is sewn pretty crookedly. Like the stitching is straight is some places and zig zag in other but it isn't too noticeable. Overall it's great for the price!


This feels amazing on- very comfortable and quality fabric, more satiny than a sheen cotton as I thought. The zipper operation was very smooth and it all looks and feels well-made! I will enjoy wearing this to weddings and graduations. Only one note - if your bustline is big, the XL was just big enough, and the waist becomes a little short then.


(Should be fixed by wearing an extra supportive or minimizer bra!)


While the dress is made well, the waistline (if you want to call it that) is in the worst place. Itâ€™s not an A line. Itâ€™s not at the waistline. Itâ€™s in the middle of your gut. So disappointed with this dress because it was apparently constructed with shorter people in mind. ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


Not Grace Karin as advertised. It says Junjifashion. The pattern is clearly not as advertised and I'm rather skeptical as to it being 96% cotton. Took forever to ship so I couldn't use it for the intended purpose.


It fits well though, I'll give them that much


My daughter bought this dress and she usually wears a medium and we ordered this in medium and it's a little bigger than we thought it would but fits good and she's not done growing yet. We love the colors and how modest it is!
