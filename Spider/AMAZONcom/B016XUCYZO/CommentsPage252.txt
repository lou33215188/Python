Great dress!! Size fit true; I am 5ft 11 and the dress falls just a little above the knee...perfect with a petticoat! Belt feels cheap but that's an easy fix. Can't wait for my 60's themed party!


This would be a great dress for someone more broad shouldered or bigger chested than me. I was sad to return it. It really is a beautiful dress and a beautiful fit.


Read the reviews and ordered a size up, the material is stretchy and looks amazing on. Very nice material and design.


the only thing i don't like is the plastic zipper other than that ver nice.


I love this dress. I went with the XL because I was thinking maybe it runs small. It doesn't.  In fact it was too big in my waist, but a little snug in my chest, but I do carry my weight in my chest and legs, so all in all it's a great dress.


I love this dress and I received so many compliments.  The only issue I had was the separate petticoat was not long enough, but the dress was beyond fantastic!!! I recommend this and I will be placing an order for another color.


Love this dress. It fits perfectly with a Petticoat. Super cute.


Read all the reviews plus size guidelines and I swear someoneâ€™s lying! Purchased a medium and needed a small. Small tear in dress. Whomp.


I'm 5'5" and typically wear a 26/28. The 4X fit great. The dress was perfect for a Havana Nights themed fundraiser, I got a lot of compliments on it, and this shipped SO FAST! So grateful for it. I'm on the right in this picture.


My sweetheart looks adorable in this.
