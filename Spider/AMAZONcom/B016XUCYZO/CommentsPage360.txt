I loved this dress I got so many compliments!! I ordered an xl I'm 5'6 38DD so my boobs were pushed in a little but overall beautiful dress I was very satisfied! I wore it to my dad's wedding. If I got larger would have been too big. The other reviews really helped me

Cute dress flowy and nice fitted .. It hide the imperfection in your tummy ğŸ˜�


The material is a little thinner than I expected but it is pretty cute.  The size matches the chart.  I am normally a size 4 dress and size small fits me perfect.
