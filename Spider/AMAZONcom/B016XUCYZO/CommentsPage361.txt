Beautiful dress. I received many compliments. It was a tiny bit large under the arms, but looked great with a small sequined cardigan.  Super fast shipping. It arrived before expected, even though it was close to Christmas. Would recommend this dress and this seller.


SO GORGEOUS!!!!


Love It! The fit is great and is very flattering. Can be worn with or without the petticoat, but I love wearing it with!


Such a cute dress! It fit well with a little room. But it is well made and very cute on.


I love this dress. The size comparison that it had for a US size was perfect. I will continue to order from this company.


Beautiful dress. The not if stretch makes it fit perfectly.


Beautiful dress


I loved this dress and the fit and style was perfect.  I will definately buy a few more of these dresses and I will certainly look at other styles from Grace Karen.


Beautiful dress but small around the bust area and waist.


I feel like Alice in Wonderland in this gorgeous dress.
