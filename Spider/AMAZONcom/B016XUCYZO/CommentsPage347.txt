This is my third of this dress I have purchased. Fits like a glove and I love the smaller chest as not all plus size girls are busty


Im asian 4" 11 heights and 113lbs fit as expected but has an extra gap on my breast area  as Im wearing cap A . Other than that product and quality of material is good.  From Bermuda


This is adorable! Well made, nice fabric. I unfortunately have to return as I'm in between sizes and neither dress that I ordered fit but it's not a problem with the dress. The dress is very nice!


I wish they had more styles/patterns to pick from. I would buy them all. Great fit and they wash well.


Bought this dress along with a black petticoat for a 1950 party. I usually wear a size 12-14 but mostly 14 in a dress so I bought a size up(XL). Fits like a glove!  The dress is cotton but seems to have a bit of give. Material is a good weight and with the petticoat it hangs and twirls beautifully. Very pleased with this purchase.


I love the dress but I thought it fits tight through the chest.  I am 5'5" and weigh 167 lbs.  I normally wear a 12/14 dress size.  I'm keeping it as I hope I lose weight and it might work out fine.???
