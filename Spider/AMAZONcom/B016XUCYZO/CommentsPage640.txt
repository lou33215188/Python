Dress was my size,  but came above knee did not look like the height on pictures provided by customer so wanted to wear this dress.


I bought this item off ebay and I'm going to purchase another one here. It is so beautiful and the quality is really good. Definitely recommended!


It was too large. Gave it to my younger sister. Who loves it and fits her well.


I absolutely love this dress, it fits perfectly!  The quality of the fabric and the construction are greater than expected! I will definitely purchase from this site again!


Dress fit nicely.....loved it.


The dress was so small I could barely get it on.  The waist was very high, and the arm opening was very tight.


Sizes bear no resemplance to reality


I want my money back.


This dress is really nice!!! I received a lot of compliments. I wore it to a wedding.it just made me feel very classy and I paired it with pearls. The only thing is it's made of cotton/cotton blend so it wrinkles easily after sitting. But this dress is a must and will be ordering more!


Somewhat small
