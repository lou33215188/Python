This dress fits me better than anything that I have purchased in a few years.


Beautiful dress but didn't fit me. :(


My wife is plus size and its so hard to find a dress she loves and fits in that being said she loves this one it fits great and shes gorgeous in it. Worth the buy.follow the size chart.


Great dress, nice material. Doesn't look cheap. Fit great except it is a little snug under the arms. I'm 5'5 150lbs curvy and ordered a medium, I'm normally an 8 in dresses. I plan to order this dress again but in black. I ordered the royal blue dress, true too color in the picture.


fits great, slightly stretchy fabric. I wore this for an outdoor wedding shower and included the white petticoat - very fun and very comfortable.


This looks great I bought it for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it. It does have a bit of room in the chest area. Not so much that it takes away from the over all look but it is there.


I bought this as a last minute Halloween costume, my husband and I went as Johnny Cash and June Carter. My husband loved me in this dress and it fit great. Halloween or not I'd wear it again.


Order a larger size if you have large breasts.


Excellent. I haven't worn it all day but trying it on it fits exactly as expected, the hips are in a natural place and the zipper is good quality. The material is perfectly soft and the colors of the flowers are vibrant and beautiful. Highly recommend. I'm planning to wear it as a costume for Halloween (Betty Draper from Mad Men) but this dress will be perfect for church too


The belt was not in the bag on the dress I did not receive a belt I would like a belt for 3x please
