The material is very good, but a little bit small for me, still love it


Dress was nice but not what I expected. It sits really high and not anywhere near my waste. shipping took a long time.

So cute! Loved the fabric. Itâ€™s got just enough stretch to be comfy.


I bought this dress for my mom I loved the quality the size is exactly what I ordered!


A stand out dress, I paired it with a vintage net slip and it is adorable.


Cute. Came a little wrinkly but once I iron it, I think it'll look great.


I am very happy with this purchase. It was perfect.


I love this dress. Fit as expected. Belt was too long, but I just tucked it into itself. Great for formal occasions, just do NOT let the wind catch this dress outside or you will give everyone a show!


This is the cutest dress. I got it for my daughter. She is 5'7" and 115 lbs and the small fit her just perfectly.
