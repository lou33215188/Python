Material and cut are so much betyer than I expected.  Fits exactly as the size chart said.

Love this dress and received so many compliments at work.  Very flowy...and wore without a petticoat, just the dress itself.  Received very wrinkled and ironed the mess out of it...and was very wrinkled by end of day.  But, I still love it and can't wait to order more.


Got the yellow and it was not gold at all....very pretty yellow!!


Got this dress in the blue and the purple roses for bridesmaids dresses. Beautiful and the dresses are comfy and fun with the full skirt!


I always have trouble finding shirts that fit with my small bust despite my size. However, I love the pattern and the brightness!


So beautiful and fits wonderful
