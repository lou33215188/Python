Very beautiful I got lots of complementts


I loved wearing this dress! Everyone else seemed to love me wearing it too! Lol


I was nervous getting this and seeing reviews of others buying a bigger size. But I went by the measurements and it fit perfectly! I love this dress!


So pleased with this dress. Very good quality.  Fits perfect!


Looks like a sac. Went by the measurements, but it was way too big.


Loved this dress! It fits  as expected and you don't really need to wear it with a petticoat underneath. The only thing is the zipper was a little tough to zip and unzip.


I love the dress!! this is the second time I order the same dress. My daughter love it and I gave to her!!


This is a beautiful dress. I was nervous when I ordered it and was hoping it wouldn't be a cheap stiff material! Well it's not. Very soft, ironed easily. Didn't give a 5 star rating because my daughter hasn't tried it on yet.


I love this dress! Fits my curves well! Will purchase more.


I ordered the size the guide stated and it fits great.


It is beautiful and fun to wear.
