Great dress for the price! Looking forward to wearing this to work in the spring


This is a beautiful dress.  The only problem is the bust line fits smaller than advertised.  This was disappointing but plan to return for the next size up.


Fit was great - a little long for my 5' 3" height but made it work.


High quality dress.  Fit as expected.  Very comfortable and cute!


This dress is perfect! Super classy and petticoat totally not necessary but I'm sure would look lovely. You cannot beat the price! The quality is great! Happy happy customer!


This dress is all the style, color, and fit of a throw  back dress. I love it. I bought  two : red with big black dots/black with tiny white dots.


Terrible quality feels like construction paper. The zipper did not work even when it was not on me.


Perfect for the event


Color is great ,but quality is trash..


Zipper broke.


I love this dress.  I received so many compliments the day I wore it.  It fit perfectly on me. Very cute and classy.
