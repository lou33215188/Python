I like the pattern but the cut is kind of frumpy, especially the neckline. Will probably end up tailoring it and it will be perfect.


This dress is excactly what I wanted, and so much better than expected. Sizes are true but more “form fitting”. Great dress great quality, and most importantly it makes me feel great. Highly suggest


Cannot repeat how much I love this dress. I usually wear a 6-8 in dresses but ordered the small based on reviews. It's an absolutely perfect fit!
