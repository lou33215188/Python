Love these tea dresses. Umpire waistline. Material does wrinkle easy. Would be great with a slip that puffs out the skirt a little


Fits well except in the bodice, a little baggy


Fabric and quality is great! Hate that I have to dry clean it, but its beautiful!


Dress fits perfect. I am 5'4" and 150lbs. I normally wear a size 6, I ordered the Medium. I ordered the dress for a Halloween costume but everyone told me it was pretty and I could wear anytime. Love it!


Love dress. Nice material. Washes easy. Got tons of compliments on it. Itâ€™s unique and vibrant. Does wrinkle fast and easy, must iron. Otherwise perfect.


love it


beautiful dress for our performances.


My boyfriend LOVES this dress. So do I. Will be ordering more in different colors. An excellent patten, design and fabric. Thank you.


I love this dress! It is very flattering, and I received many compliments. I'm 5'6" and 145 lbs, a medium fit perfect for me. It lands right at the top of my knee. I layered it with a petticoat and it was very pretty.


It's a great dress but if you have any breasts at all you might want to order a larger size. I had to bring it to a trailer for added sides.
