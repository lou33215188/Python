I absolutely love this dress! The fit is perfect, material is great and pattern is awesome. Overall just wonderful. I'm extremely happy.


Liking this dress


Material is nice though a little see through. Pleasantly surprised.


Looks great on! Very slimming and at first my daughter said I don't know if I like it (wasn't use to the style).  Then she looked into the mirror and said ok LOVE it. Classy and can work for lots of different occasions.

I sent it back, wasn't at all what I was expecting


Very cute.  A little big but still looks cute


disappointed infit


Such a beautiful dress. Great fabric and packaged very well. I am planning on buying another in a different color.


Love, love, love. I get compliments every time I wear this dress.


The only downside is that it wrinkles super easily.
