This dress was too small. I usually wear a 16, but it felt like I needed at least 2 sizes larger. I'm not going to chance it though. Love the style though.


I was so excited to get this! I'm a size 18/20 and the 2x is perfect! The skirt has its own volume so there's no need for crinoline. I felt like a child spinning around in it when it came in the mail. So many compliments too!


Fabulous, fits perfectly! I'm 5'3" and 140 lbs, the large is perfect. Paired with the crinoline it looks terrific!


Pretty dress ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


The skirt of this dress is a bit fuller than I expected it to be. The belt that came with it, however, is huge.  I tightened it to the smallest possible notch, but it still hung lower than expected (I am not "small" either; size 12 typically).  This dress would be beautiful with a sash/ribbon-style belt.


Perfect dress for daddy daughter dance . Everyone liked the dress.


I bought a 2x, it  was slightly small in the waist. That was my fault though, I believe. I havenâ€™t worn it out yet, but I love it.


It fits perfect and looks very cute. Very flattering. The belt was missing, though. But I still give 5 starts, because I wasn't going to use the belt anyway.


I love the idea of the dress but poorly made for fit.  It is substandard quality and I am returning it. Don't purchase poorly sewn


The dress was pretty, but I returned it.  Sometimes I wear a small, and sometimes a medium.  It was too tight in the bust and throughout shoulders and torso in a medium.  I am 5'2" 135 lbs. I am not extremely busty either. The material was pretty.
