She loves this. It fits her nicely.


This dress is perfect!


I was nervous purchasing this dress as I am curvy and a nursing mom. But this dress fit perfect. The only thing is I am 5"3 150lbs and very busty. Fit perfect aside from being a little longer than I'd like


Exactly what I wanted.  This dress is beautiful and the quality is exceptional. I will be ordering others.  The petticoat gave it that extra pizazz !


The dress was larger than I was expecting, especially through the waist. May have to take it in a bit to fit correctly, but I love the skirt on this dress.


The material is thicker than I was expecting (which is a good thing).


This is the first plus sized dress I've bought online that fit comfortably without alterations!  It was a great fit overall.  Will definitely keep this brand in mind for future purchases.


Soft material. Fits very well


I can't believe how awesome this dress is for how inexpensive it is. I got a half dozen compliments the day I wore it. It's comfortable and sturdy, not lined or anything, but exactly as advertised. Great buy!


I love this dress. It's amazing.


Absolutely LOVE this dress! The only problem was that it didn't come with the belt. However, I was refunded 20% for that. The material is awesome ❤️ I wore it to a Bridal Tea Party. Will definitely order more!
