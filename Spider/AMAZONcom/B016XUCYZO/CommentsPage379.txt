i bought this for my wife, it fits her properly and she is very happy


Dress not as long as I thought it would be. Beautiful style and great quality, just not a little shorter than I expected.


I didn't get the belt.


I've had so many compliments I'll be ordering more!  The fit as great though it is a tad bit in the neck but it looks amazing


Beautiful dress. Fits great


This dress fit perfectly. Normally a size twelve with 36ddd, went with XL and fit was spot on. I received many compliments and will be purchasing some other patterns. Great dress!


Absolutely cannot find a better dress for the money. Bought for my daughter for a dance, fit perfect.


The dress was beautiful, and I was very happy with it!  I should have gone a size up and not follow the chart.  I think the XL runs small.  But the dress is great!!  Everyone loved it!


Very rough material,  but durable.  Wash with fabric softener before wearing
