Nice dress for the money.  Bought it for my 13-year-old daughter.  She loves it!  Full skirt "twirls" beautifully!  She looks adorable in it.


Washed up perfect. Kept shape and size. Love it.


I bought this dress for my grand daughter..she totally loves it but your consumer product division needs to have a better check before the item is shipped..the belt loop to hold the excess belt is located on the wrong side..just thought you would like to know


Perfect summer dress, light cotton, flowy skirt, so feminine.  Put it with a lavender shrug and lavender sandals.


I had to order multiple dresses for a choir preformance. They were for my daughter and her friends. The dresses were exactly what they needed and look great on stage. The sizing chart was extremely helpful in making sure each of the girls received a dress that fit correctly.


This looks great with a pettiskirt, without one not as cute, but that's just my style. Great to wear for date night or a Buddy Holly tribute concert. Medium fits me well at 130lbs and 5'4. Belt is not a keeper but I expected that based on other reviews.


I wear this to work a lot, but would love to put a petticoat underneath and wear it somewhere fun too. Sturdy material, fit as expected. Please with this purchase.


Very nice dress, my daughter loved it for Easter and its hard to get her in a dress... let-alone a flowery one. I like the material, just wrinkles easy. You will need a petticoat to get the full and round effect!


Beautiful! I love it! Fits perfectly! I got a xs and I'm 5'4 125 lbs


No alterations needed.  Excellent quality.  Everyone's body type is different, but this is very flattering and unique.  Great shipping.
