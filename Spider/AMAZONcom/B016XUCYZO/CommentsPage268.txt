This is a beautiful dress.  I ordered a medium (I'm 5'6", 135 lbs., 34C bra) and the top was a bit too snug, so I had to return it.  Also, it did not come with a belt as shown and stated in the description.


Would love to be able to wear it....it's so small and short waisted, I believe only a small oriental woman could wear it


Love this for swing dance events


This dress is amazing.  It far exceeded my expectations.  I thought it would be a casual dress but it has a silky somewhat formal look.  Im about 5â€™6 190 lbs with large boobs & it fit so perfectly.


I purchased this dress somewhat hesitant.  I received it today and it is perfect!!!!!!!!!  I got size large, I am 5' 2" and usually a size 12-14, the length is slightly below the knee.  The bodice fits perfectly.


I am going to buy more dresses from this designer.


Beautiful dress but the zipper is not straight. I was really sad about the zipper since this dress is really cute. I will be returning since I cannot get over the zipper.


Pretty dress. Fit perfectly.


i love this dress, nice fit, comfortable and fun.


Cute dress. Fits nicely.


This dress is an amazing buy. One complaint is the top of the dress is unlined. A camisole is needed to prevent your bra from being seen. Second complaint is the lack of pockets but for under $30, it's forgiven. The fit is perfect for my daughter. I generally order garments by waist. The size chart is spot on for her usual size. Will buy more fabric patterns.
