Not recommended. Bad


Loved it it was a gorgeous dress little tight on the neck area but overall good quality and suggest that you get an extra extra  large on the dress if you are busty and very curvy


Very well made for the price.


Beautiful dress. Fits perfectly, but the seam in the back came undone and had to return. But they were Great about taking back item.


The cut is for short waisted peepz not tall or long waisted peepz.


Cute dress, if I could have zipped up the back


Beautiful dress not alot of stretch though. Mine did not come with a belt as shown either.


I washed it in warm water and dried it ( it says dry clean only ) but I wanted it to shrink and it did ... Fits nice now lol


I love it. The full slip makes it even more adorable and fun to wear.


This is a gorgeous dress and is well made. The only problem I had is that it runs large. I purchased a extra large according to the size chart but the dress is gaping all around. I am returning for a medium and hoping it fits better as the material has some stretch. This was purchased on my father's account.
