Very pretty


Loved dress...But thought it would be puffy like pic...have to buy petticoat


fits just right and washes and irons well.


It was a little high waisted for me because I am tall but otherwise the fit was good.


I'm so pleased with this dress. The material is not heavenly, but that's ok, I'm no angel.


Love it! It looks and feels great, I have received many compliments. I'm 5'1" and weigh 127 and the medium was a bit too big, but it still looked great and I'm never very good at guessing my size for online orders.


This was a great dress!!! It was a little snug and that was because of the material blend. I received tons of compliments on this dress.


Beautiful dress!!


If you have broad shoulders perfect dress. My daughter is petite and 5'3 -and 108lbs small was perfect fit. With the petticoat she loves it


It is perfect! Itâ€™s exactly as described and fits according to what the size chart says
