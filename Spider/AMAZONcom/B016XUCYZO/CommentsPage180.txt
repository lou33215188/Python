I adore this dress.  I bought it for my graduation, and I got a ton of compliments on it.  I feel so pretty in it.  It's a great cut, and a modest length without being dowdy.  Very comfortable, too!


I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the dress, the stitching and the "heavy" fabric. At that price I wasn't sure what to expect.


Can't wait to wear it at my friend's 50's party!


This dress is very pretty. It is exactly as described.


I love this dress. Fits perfectly. Ordered a size Extra Small and it fits great. The belt was very long for the dress and needed to be wrapped around almost twice.  The material is perfect more than what I expected. Will be purchasing more from this designer.


So cute and flattering.  The material is slightly stretchy, so it really works for my fuller figure.  With platform shoes, it is terrific. I purchased XL and fit is great.  I am 5'4" and 170lb, very buxom.


This dress fits beautifully!


I love the style


I love the comfort


I love the fit!!!!!


I will be ordering more of this item in different color styles :)


This dress is gorgeous. Bought it for my daughter's  graduation and she looked stunning. Couldn't be happier.


This dress is very colorful and what I expected. The fit is nice and there is stretch to the fabric, so it is comfortable. Have already worn in 3 times and have received many compliments on it. :0)


This dress is bomb and I get complicated every time I wear it. The reds of the roses look really amazing on the white fabric. I thought I'd be disappointed in the quality, thinking it would be a risk to buy something cheap, but the quality is better than expected. The tiny little hoops on the waist to hold the waist belt came loose pretty quickly, but they're not missed.


This dress is too cute. Love it! Nice material and a perfect fit. Will be shopping around for another one soon.
