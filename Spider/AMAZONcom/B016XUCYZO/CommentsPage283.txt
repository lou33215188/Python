If I could rate it higher I would.  It's adorably stylish.  Good quality for price and fits very well. The skirt portion is shorter that I'd expected based a few A line dresses I order earlier.  But I still love it! Get tons of compliments all day!


This dress is amazing! It is so flattering and fits perfectly! I'm 180 and bought the XL. Fits like a glove and I feel beautiful in it!


super cute and fun dress!


This is a high quality dress! Trust all the great reviews. I'm glad I measured myself because it was 100% accurate to the measurements.  I can't wait to wear this to a summer wedding. It will also be perfect for Sunday church services!


AWESOM DRESS and well made and nicely packaged.


Absolutely adore this dress.  Great fit at the bodice.  Fun print.


Very nice fabric and style. Looks very cute with the tutu skirt/petticoat. Very flattering dress!


Very comfortable, runs a bit large but not so much that it isn't flattering. Very cute


The dress is Gorgeous! I love it so much. Buying 3 more.


I really like this dress and actually just ordered it in another pattern. I gave it four stars instead of five because it wrinkles really easily and it fits a little strangely at the top--a little tight around the armpit area but gaps a little bit at the top in the middle. But overall I really do like it! Looks fine with or without belt.
