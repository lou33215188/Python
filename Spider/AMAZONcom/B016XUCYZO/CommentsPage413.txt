Beautiful dress but fit smaller than another one I ordered in a different fabric.


Lovely


I still can't believe this dress fits so well. It looks beautiful and classy and fits as perfectly as I hoped it would. I definitely recommend this!


I bought this in blue earlier this year. I have not worn this one yet. But is well made and I love it


Quality is excellent given the price.


This dress fit ok, it was a little loose in the torso section although I measured to make sure I ordered the right size. I also expected a little better quality for the fabric. It served its purpose so this is why 3 stars.


Beautiful! Lovely material!!! I am a size 6, 32c, 5'8" ordered small and fit perfectly!


Beautiful Material BUT my goodness  Far way too big for me and I did follow the guidline


This dress was great fitting,but I'd u have a stomach get one size bigger if u don't have a stomach get your regular size.


Just a bit in the waist area.
