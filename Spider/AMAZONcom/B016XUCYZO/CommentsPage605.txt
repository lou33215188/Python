Love the dress


Beautiful dress!


It's cute but feels too tight under my arms


I love this dress! I got a crinoline and it's perfect. Every time I wear it I get compliments, thinking of getting another pattern in this same cut. The neckline is great and it's an empire waist, so very flattering. Its made of a good cotton weight, irons well if you need to, and its very comfortable (great in the Texas heat). I may buy a sash or thicker belt to go with this as I'm a larger curvy gal and I think it would look nice.


Nice prints, the dream looks and feels great.
