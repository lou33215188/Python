Love the dress!  Perfect fit!


Love


no room for the girls. made the waistline way too high, and the neckline felt weird


Everwhere I went people told me that they loved this dress on me. Winner!


It came with a super cute belt, was a tiny bit big, but arrived way sooner than expected, so that was a major bonus since I can wear it to work now!!


fitss good, feels good!
