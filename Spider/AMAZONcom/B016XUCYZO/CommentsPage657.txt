I actually ordered the dress on a different account but I am absolutely in love with it!  I purchased the dress for a dance for an organization I am in.  I am a broke college kid so the price of this dress was perfect for me.  The material is pretty thick and of good quality.  I absolutely love how it fits, did change out the belt with one I already had however.  As a short girl with a bigger waist and chest I was a bit worried on how it would fit and look, but it fit me perfectly.


Tight around arms and chest. Moving arms forward was uncomfortable, could be the type of fit, and no stretch to fabric. Overall it was a nice dress and is priced very reasonable.


This is...incredible. hands down my favorite dress, it is beautiful and high quality. I'm 5'7 amd it comes to my knees. I love it!


So cute! I am a size 20/5ft9in and got a 3x and it's a bit tight in the bust but fit everywhere else. I am about a 42dd. Comfortably, it would probably fit a 38dd. Still going to wear it with a cardigan and pray my breasts don't bust out.


Fit very well. I was afraid it'd be too big, but for the most part it fit well. Usually wear a medium, so check the sizing chart.


The fabric feels like a tablecloth, but fits beautifully, flares perfectly, and I got hundreds of compliments. The dress creases and wrinkles very easy, but the fabric itself is thick. By far one of my best buys off Amazon, and would highly suggest.


I love this dress i got it and i love it so much i personally ordered the petticoat as well because it gives it that fluff it needs, and high suggest to order one too. Other than that most definitely would recommend!


Beautiful dress. When I got it home it seemed a little big, but once I put it on it fit perfectly.


I give it five stars!


I love this company! The sizing is normal for the US. Quality made and lovely fabrics.


I liked the picture better....
