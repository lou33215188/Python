Very pretty dress. I would be very interested in more colors.


Very Cute!!! I just got it a few days ago. I'm planning on wearing it to a wedding in a few days!!!! It's guys well the mrasurements on the size chart from the company are very accurate.


I wore this for my birthday to church and I got so many likes for it! I felt beautiful in it and I will be buying more!


My granddaughter loves these dresses!


Beautiful dress, colors are great, returned a little too snug through the ribs, may reorder. I had ordered another style so I had two options for my event.


I @&$%ing LOVE this dress! It fits me perfectly! Such great quality fabric and stitching for such an affordable price! I'm totally buying more with different colors. I'm a top heavy size 18 and was worried it would be too tight up top but, it fits perfectly!


The material has a nice weight to it, not too light and not too heavy. It fits perfectly in the waist and the bust and the length is perfect. This is an AMAZING dress! I bought a petticoat to go with it and canâ€™t wait to wear it to teach in! I plan on buying one in almost every color!


super cute, light, delicate dress, very comfortable. Suitable size in size.


Love it!!!
