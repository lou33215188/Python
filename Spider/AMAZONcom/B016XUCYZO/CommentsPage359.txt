Lovely dress!


The dress fit fine but I had to cinch the belt so tightly there was a lot of extra that kind of hangs there unless I pin it. Love the pattern and design of the dress but the belt could use a little loop on it perhaps to hold the excess against my side.

I ordered this to wear for my son's wedding. It is just lovely.


Beautiful dress! Very comfortable and the belt pulls it together nicely. I'm buying a white petticoat to go under it though, so it doesn't lay as flat.


I love this dress; can't wait to wear it.  Great fit, fabric, etc.


Great dress for the price.  Works best with a tutu skirt underneath.


Wonderful!


Chest area was tight - if you are large chested it will be snug


I bought this for a summer wedding. I was a little worried it would be small, but fits perfect. It's absolutely beautiful.
