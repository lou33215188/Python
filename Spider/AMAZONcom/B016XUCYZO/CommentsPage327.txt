I am 5' 4 and about 110 lbs., I ordered an XS. Fit perfectly. Love the length of it, landed right above the knee. Perfect dress for church and family gatherings.


This is really 5-star-worthy - the only issue being that the purchaser has to punch a hole in the belt herself.


Love this dress!  It fit perfectly and looked beautiful on Easter morning!  The fabric is good quality, the belt worked out perfectly!


Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! You can change the look by changing the belt colors and shoes.


Fabric is great quality and the flare is beautiful. At first, I felt like I looked like a linebacker because of the cut of the top BUT I tried it on backwards and the visual of a v-neck makes it look amazing. One of my best purchases!


Adorable...tons of compliments! Great Derby dress!


I was nervous about the fit, but followed the reviews and took my measurements. I think I probably could have went a size lower, but it was still pretty cute. Iâ€™m normally a 2x, but the 1x would have been a perfect fit.


Great quality!  Fits true to size


Beautiful! Received so many compliments.


I liked the dress but was a little too big and it made me look fatter than what i really am.
