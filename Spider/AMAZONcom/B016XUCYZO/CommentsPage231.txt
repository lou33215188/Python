Lots of extra fabric on the bottom, so I had to get it altered . Very pretty nontheless.


Cute dress. Fit as expected. The belt is Crap. It doesn't have an extra loop to hold the end. You either have to create a loop or cut the end of the belt.


very femine


Perfect fit and beautiful colors.


It was perfect! Exactly what I ordered from the very start! Great job! Expectations met perfectly. Looks great with a petticoat underneath!


I'm using this dress for a 50's party. Will use a full crinoline under the skirt. Normally I wear a size 4 dress and the small feels 'fitted' on me. If you are full figures on top you may want the next size up. Fabric is similar to polished cotton and so will wrinkle , just like dresses did before polyester. But I love this purchase!


The instructions say to follow the sizing that they have listed and not Amazon sizing...I wish I had gone with the Amazon sizes as the dress was WAY TOO big! I am going to need to take it to be altered. Otherwise the quality of the material is great, the design is beautiful. I would order again with a different design and select a smaller size.


Very pleased with this product, fits very well too. The reviews did help alot.


Great dress, though the belt that came with it didn't fit for me, but I have a long torso and large rib cage.


I can't say enough about this dress. It's beautiful and fun and I got a ton of compliments!
