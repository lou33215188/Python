I didn't measure until after I ordered. pretty dress though


Beautiful dress. Wore it to my daughter's wedding reception which was a 50's theme. Have it as facebook profile pictures with all my lovely daughters.


It's a precious dress, but the sizing seems to be inconsistent with the chart.


Follow the measurements and you wont be disappointed.  My daughter loves this dress. Well Pleased


The dress is beautiful!! Just like the picture! It didn't really fit as expected but I just need to lose some pounds to fit in the dress. Satisfied tho.


Classic, elegant look, but unflattering if you have short legs.


It's a beautiful dress, just a little tight in chest. For women with a little more up top, check size chart. Perfect fit everywhere else.


love the color and the price.. but come wrinkle and need to iron before wear


I normally wear between a small and a medium. I order a small and it fits tightly but definitely fits. Looks very cute. The material is a little hot so I would wear it when it gets cooler.


Gorgeous dress! The fit is very lovely and very flattering. I loved this dress so much I bought another one. You really have to buy a petticoat though so the dress will look nicer and the shape of the dress to come out more. The belt that came with it is a bit long but can be cut or adjusted to fit you. Very nice quality dress. Very impressed!
