Wonderful piece, great quality


Lovely dress fit perfect!


If you think sizing up will be to big... It wont


I chose my size according to the measurements and it fit perfectly! I love this dress. It is so cute and I cannot wait to wear it.


exellent!


It was so amazing on, my family ordered me another one with bright pink polka dots


Very cute on my 13 y/o daughter paired with a petticoat slip.


I usually don't write reviews and I'm skeptical about buying dresses through Amazon.  But this dress is AMAZING.  It fit me exactly and I am seriously thinking about buying more!


This dress is good quality, good material, fits perfectly, and is flattering. I'm buying more with different colors!!


Love it
