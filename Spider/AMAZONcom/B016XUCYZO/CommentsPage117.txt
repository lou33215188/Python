The dress is well made for the price, and is a very nice-weight cotton fabric. It is unlined. If it had pockets it would be the most perfect dress ever! I used the sellers' sizing chart and it is accurate. I added a GK Queen petticoat which gives just a bit of flair. If you are a child of the 50's as I am, this dress is not too "young" for you! It is great for many shapes of women, just as this style was back in those days. I bought it to wear to my daughters' outdoor wedding this coming July. It's pretty, comfortable, and summery! I love it and can't wait to wear it!


This dress is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! I got so many compliments & it truly made me feel like a queen! I'm ordering another one soon!


This dress was perfect! I loved the style, cut, color and all the compliments! I'd definitely order from this company again!


This dress is so adorable! ! I wanted it to work so much, but it's very small in the bodice area. I ordered a size up but still too tight across the chest. Also too short from shoulder to waist :(. I'm a 34 D and usually a size small . The material and workmanship are excellent quality . But if you're a little busty or have a long torso this dress will nother fit you well.


Super cute but cheaper quality then I expected. Very thin material and more of a causal dress then I expected. Skirt lacks the flare represented in the picture. More of a baby doll fit which is not what I desired. Cute dress just disappointed that it isn't the quality that I anticipated. Wanted to wear this for a wedding but it's far too casual in the type of material used.


It is true to size. I bought the XXXL & will be returning it since I got too big a size.  My normal size is XXL. Can't wait for the 2 I ordered in xxl.


Better half loves this "old school" dress.  She usually wears small & small in this fits her great!  Well built & very pretty.


I'm in love ğŸ˜�


I'm 5'5 125lb 32" chest and the small size fits me like a glove!


So happy with my purchase!


The fabric is great. I ordered a size up because of the reviews but it fits big at least I can have it fixed to fit. The belt is not all that but the outfit overall is great for the price. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. I recommend this purchase.
