The dress is perfect.


Quality looks cheap in my opinion but i still love the dress


Would have got four stars maybe five the fabric doesn't seem the same but it fits just right I will post pictures once I receive them.


Beautiful dress but I ordered too big in size. Hopefully I get the size right next time. The material is so pretty .


zipper is a little snug at waist and I usually wear a medium dress.


Love the dress and the feel of the material


Very nice


VERY cute! I got so many compliments on this dress. It looks much more expensive than it is too. LOVE


Somewhat smaller than I thought it would be but by far my favorite dress


I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's a really nice dress!


Love it! So cute for the price!
