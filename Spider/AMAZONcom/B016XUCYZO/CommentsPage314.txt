Very nice and beautiful dress. Fit Perfectly. Very good quality. I really like this dress.


Perfect dress. I have no blend with it. It's made with good materials.


Daughter looked great!


I bought this dress for a wedding rehearsal dinner and I couldn't have been happier!! It fit like a glove, it was super comfy, and was so precious on.  I paired it with some t-strap black and white wing tipped shoes (that I also bought on Amazon) and received so many compliments on both the dress and shoes. Well worth the money!


I like it but went with something else.


Returned due to size/fit.


Haven't worn it yet, but it's pretty.


Beautiful dress!


Love the style and the material is really soft and good quality.


This dress is absolutely GORGEOUS!!!!  Don't ever buy any of the others that look like GKs.  The material is superior, the craftsmanship is superior, and TOTALLY WORTH IT!
