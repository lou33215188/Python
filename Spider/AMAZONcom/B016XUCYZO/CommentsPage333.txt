Very cute dress for my daughter! XS fits as expected. Good price for a nice dress.


Very happy with my new dress. The material was nicer than I expected for the price, very lovely to have an invisible zipper as well.


So cute! Dont know where or how to wear it, but I'll figure that out later


It has a Cheap fabric feel.


I absolutely love this dress!!! I wore it to work and received several compliments!! ğŸ™‚I'll be purchasing other prints!!


GOR-GEOUS. This dress looks like it's worth much more than it's priced at here. It fits me fantastically and I'm a dress size 12. It's a flattering classic cut.


Dress runs small.  If you order a size larger than you normally  wear, it should fit.


I had low expectations for this dress, but was absolutely blown away by how beautiful it is!!!  The color is beautiful and fit is true to size. I already had a small black belt I love, so I wore that one. The!belt it comes with seemed like a thin velvet. It was nice enough, but probably would not last the life of the dress.


This came a little small even after ordering up, but still fits. Just make sure you measure yourself and check their measurements before you buy. Great dress for spring.


Very comfortable, no krenlin needed
