Returned too small


The dress is made out of very wrinkly material, also very thin.  The way the other reviews were written, it sounded like you should wear a tutu-like thing under it but that it wasn't necessary.  However, when I put the dress on, the lengths on the sides were much noticably longer than the front or back.  And lastly, I am 6' tall and the waist on this thing came to underbust.  Not a good look.


loved it... fit perfectly


Love it, it's made well and the material is of good quality. I bought it a size up because I'm showing in between sizes. I should have gone a size down but it will work.


I wore this dress the 1st day and received at least a dozen compliments, I used a wider belt than the one that came with it, but I love this dress.


Fits well. Just very wrinkled and the fabric is a little coarser than expected.


Love this dress, but it was a little loose in the chest area. (Size small) I just wore a padded bra to compensate


Fits OK but a little tight.  Just not the right fit for a 3X girl... But it is a better quality than I had expected at that price.  Maybe I'll just drop 20 lbs :-)


Wore this to a 50's Sock Hop.  Lots of compliments and the dress was comfortable with a little black short sweater!


small cut
