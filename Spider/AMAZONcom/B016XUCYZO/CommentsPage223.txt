For the price this was a great dress. Looked exactly like the picture and for someone who is heavy set with DD breats, my chest fit really well


Amazing dresses.  Great for costumes or real life. Quality is amazing at this price point.


Just beautiful. I love this dress style. Such a ladies dress. I plan to purchase more. Purchase the crinlon slip to go with it makes it really stand out


Very beautiful and good quality dress. Exactly my taste. Love the elegant & classy look. Wore this to meet my boyfriend family for Christmas Eve dinner for the first time. Gave them very good impression with the look from the first moment I met them. Everybody keeps telling me the dress is very beautiful. Would recommend to wear petticoat underneath. I will definitely buy another design again.


Love it!


My rib cage was just to large. The dress is beautiful.


This is an awesome dress! I received so many compliments on it, and no one believed I


Paid less than $30. For the price, the quality is outstanding. Awesome stretchy, thick cotton. Fits perfectly!


I get a lot of compliments! I ordered a medium. 5'4", 145lbs, 36D. Perfect. Looks couture.


So pretty! Follow your measurements!


It fit perfectly, the length could have been longer but can't complain. I'm 5' 7' and 120 pounds and a medium fit well, i just didn't like the flowers once I saw it in person anymore. Seemed a little too busy to me but it came out a lot like the picture. '
