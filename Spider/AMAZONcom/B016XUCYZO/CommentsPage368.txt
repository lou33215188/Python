Beautiful dress, fit pwrfectly. I received lots of complement's and felt comfortable.


I would give 5 if the fabric was much better


This is a beautiful dress, but definitely add the petticoat underneath.


My daughter loved this dress, she had a blast at the dance !


Great quality and fit. Bought this dress for a bridal shower and it was perfect for the occasion. Very pleased with this purchase.


This is adorable. Fits really well and I got a ton of compliments on it the first time I wore it. My only gripe is that there are no care instructions on how to wash it.


Love this dress! So cute. Fits great. I got the size large. I am normally a size 8 and the large fit perfectly. It hits me at the knee and I am 5’5.


I'm impressed, nice strong fabric, long zipper. true waist fit,( not empire waisted) The belt is way too big for an XS. But overall I'm very pleased


I love this dress. It’s one of my favorite ones. The material is thin which is perfect for the summer.


Great fit!
