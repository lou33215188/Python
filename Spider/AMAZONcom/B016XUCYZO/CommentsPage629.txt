Beautiful dress, belt a little cheaply but overall looks great. I used a different belt.


perfect, it seems to have sent them to make


This dress is beautiful and the quality is amazing for something so cheap.  My daughter looks beautiful in it


The same color and pattern, but different look. The flare at the waist on the skirt is not the same as pictured. The measurement is also not accurate, cos I used the measurement and it was perfect, but when I got the dress it was kinda bigger.


Exactly as advertised, followed the size chart, ordered my size, and got my size. 10/10 would buy again. However, very frilly, but not as puffy as I would've liked, but that's just me.


Maybe I need the whole 50's hair do, and lipsick to pull this dress off. When I put it on, my husband said it looked ok... Not exactly what I wanted to hear :/ I'm going to give it another shot. I did buy a peticoat to go under it, so we'll see!


Gorgeous dress!! Highly recommend it!


Great dress!


It was somewhat larger than expected in some areas, but this was an awesome dress.


She adores this dress.
