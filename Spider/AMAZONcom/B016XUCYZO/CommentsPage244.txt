I follow the comments in the site and order a size L.  For it so not fits.  I'm 38 bust, 32 waist and 40 hips and the waist and hips was fine but the bust was to small.  But it is a beautiful dress .


This dress is beautiful!!!! I wear a US size 12-14. I bought a 3X. It fits perfect! Possibly a bit loose. SUPER cute though. I love it!!!


Wife looked hot for the Cuban themed party we went to.


I was hesitant to buy this dress at first, but upon reading some of the reviews from previous buyers i made up my mind to buy it. And when it arrived i fell inlove with it even more. The quality is very good. It fits great and its true to size as well.


I followed the chart and ordered a size up per the chart and all the recommendations and it was way too big in all areas. But it was a nice dress that I would have kept otherwise.


It was too tight in the chest area - I had to send back - which was a shame because it was a pretty dress.  I think the next size would be too big.

Beautiful dress.I love it soooooo much.


I love this dress! So cute and stylish. Fits true to size. Perfect for a 50s theme party I'm attending soon!


I love this dress!!! It was so pretty and fun to wear. I normally have a beautiful stomach pooch thanks to my two babies, and this dress hid it so well! Its flowy and fun to dance in. Very happy with my purchase.


Love this dress so much! I ordered my usual size, Large, based off the amazon sizing chart and it fit like a glove! The designs on the dress are amazing. For sure I'm getting more of these kinds of dresses!
