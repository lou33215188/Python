The dress is beautiful! It's well made and the fabric is really nice.


Got rave reviews and I also loved it and the look. I wore it with a petticoat.


I normally wear a size 10 so i ordered a medium.  The dress fit perfectly. I absolutely LOVE IT! It was everything I expected and more. I received sooooo many compliments.  I would definitely recommend.


I cannot express enough how much I love this dress! By far the most beautiful dress I've ever bought, especially for a dress I ordered online! Would definitely purchase again!


Could not be cuter or more flattering. Love this dress. Note, it is thin material so remember you get what you pay for.


What a great dress! It fits well and of decent quality.


I wear a size 2 to 4 and ordered a small. It fits perfect! You'll have to wear your own belt with it. The one it comes with is ok. I will be ordering more colors for sure


They did not send me the belt in the package with the dress.  Itâ€™s super cute though!


I love this dress so much that I'm ordering two more!!! I'm a size 24 at 5'7", so I was skeptical to say the least. However, when it arrived & I tried it on, it fit like it was made for me. I didn't want to take it off. I can't wait to wear it out!!


Beautiful dress, well made, fast shipping. My daughter wears a size 0-1 and a small in this dress was a tiny bit large on her. Wearing a crinoline skirt helped with this problem. The color is bright as pictured, it it did not fade or shrink when washing or drying. I am overall very happy with my purchase. She got senior pics made in this dress (pinup style).
