perfect fit and have many compliments on the dress, when its chilly out I put a thin black tee shirt under the dress


We love it


Slightly difficult to get into alone, but what a great retro look!


Super cute fits perfectly.. I would buy it again in a different color :)


This dress is absolutely gorgeous. I was worried about the sizing because it looked bigger than expected, but fit like a glove.


I thought it would not fit properly but I got surprised when arrive that it did! I'm a plus size girl 48 / 46 / 55, 40DD bra, bought a 3XL and fits great! Nice fabric too! I will bought it in another colors! Beautiful!


Really cute got lots of compliments


Very cute!  Can't wait to wear it!


This is an adorable dress. Wonderful fit and the length is perfect. It falls just below the knees for an average height person.


Bought as a gift and it was a hit.
