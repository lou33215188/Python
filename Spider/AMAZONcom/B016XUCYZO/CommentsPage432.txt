Love this dress. I was a little worried about ordering a dress online but this dress fit great and looked great, too.


So beautiful, and it looks so good with the petticoat I have. Worth the money down to the last penny.


Fast delivery and great fit


I love this dress! It fit perfectly and is very elegant! It was everything I expected and more! I absolutely adore it!


Love, love, love this dress! It was very comfortable. I did order 2 sizes up after reading the other comments, so I would recommend doing that.


I'm 5'6" and 140lbs and ordered  size M. I thought the dress could have been more fitted but still loved the look. It looked even better with a petticoat underneath.


What a great dress! It definitely runs large! Im 5'5 and it was a good length.


Its beautiful. It was perfect for my daughter's 5th grade banquet.


Very pretty dress, I wore it to a funeral this past weekend and it was appropriate yet stylish. I am usually a small in dresses but this was a little bigger in the waist than I expected but the belt helped fix that.


Prefect in fit and husband loved it
