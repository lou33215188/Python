Super cute, and fit just as expected.  We did take measurements so we ordered according to those measurements.


I would've given it more stars but I got an ENTIRELY different dress than I wanted. I ordered the blue polka dot and got the black and white floral design. I was pretty upset. It fit very well and had beautiful material, but it was still very upsetting that I got the wrong design.


Didn't like the way it.


I needed to send it back to Amazon for the next size up. But when I got the right size, it fit great. Really love the retro look!


Fits exactly as I was hoping! I ordered a small (34,24,36), and it had a great fall from the waist seam. I didn't use the belt it came with because I wanted a fatter belt. Material wise, the dress is not too cheap, but the belt that it came with felt like it.


Love the dress, didn't get the belt but it looks fine without it.  Wore it to a wedding and Easter and everyone loved it. Very comfortable.


I felt very dowdy in it.


Wayyyyy too small.


It is as pretty in person as it is on the page.  Material is just perfect for this style if dress.  Just refuse to go up in size when I wear the size I ordered.


Waist is a good 3 inches too high!  Otherwise nice dress
