It was probably my measurements that made it the wrong fit but that's all good.  Just took it in and got it taken in.  It worked out perfect.  The dress was super pretty and I loved wearing it at Disneyland with my family.  :)


I loved this. It fit just like the picture, and the color is just as the picture shows. So pretty! I wore it to my graduation. It was very white, so it matched my graduation gown wonderfully.


What a beautiful dress ! I got so many complements ! I am 5,2 and weight 172 pound ! It it covered 80% of my  knee.


Great dress! Just what I wanted ! I am 5'4 and this hits me right at the knees.Great material and very comfortable.


Surprisingly satisfied with this dress! Just read the reviews and size chart and you'll be fine. I'm 5'4" with a 29-inch inseam, and this dress hit me perfectly at the knees.


Looks just like the picture. Fit just right, accurate to size.


Considering returning. It looked much lighter in the picture and it's too big. Fabric isn't what I expected as it's pretty stiff.


So beautiful.  It is cut well and the material is nice. Sizing was spot on, I got a size larger than usual bc bust area is not small but a bit snug. I could have went with my original size and it still would have fit bc material has some give.


So beautiful, so amazing! I'm buying more from this seller! Fits just as described


Wore this to a wedding, got tons of compliments. It's exactly what I needed!
