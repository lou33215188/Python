I ordered a size bigger than normal, and it fits perfectly.  It's a great dress.  I may buy a thicker belt to wear with it.  The belt is really thin and I'm not sure that I like it.  But the dress is fantastic.


The color says black but it's a deep navy blue.


Fit as described and really cute.  I needed a little bit different look for an event that I was attending though.  The dots didn't quite line up nicely if wanting to wear without the belt.  The belt was very oversized.  Well made and will consider for future needs for sure


I love this dress! It fit me perfectly and the material is sturdy enough so that it looks well made despite the low price. It looks great with or without the tulle underskirt. I would buy more of these! Conservative but with a full skirt that's great for dancing! Love it!!! The only thing to remember is, wash it with like colors or with color sheets as it tends to run a bit in the wash. Make sure to wash on cold and hang dry. Haven't tried ironing yet though.


I love it because it fit me perfect but I had to return it because it got damage when I wore it for the first time it got some red stains, so I don't know why but I will order another one because I really like it and I hope it wouldn't get the same problem.


beautiful from fit to price. I received compliments on this dress all day when I wore it out.


Perfect dress for Kentucky Derby birthday party! Big hit and so pretty. For the price this is EXCEPTIONAL quality!!


This dress delivered in every way possible: color, quality, price, and WOW effect. I wore it with a petticoat for a tea party I hosted. I received several compliments on it. I'm looking forward to wearing it again! LOVE IT!!!


Cannot wait to wear this out (once it warms up a little!) It fits great, very happy with this purchase!


I absolutely LOVE this dress! It's true to size and fits perfectly and hugs all the right curves. I'll definitely purchase another in a different color!
