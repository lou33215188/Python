I received dress floral 33 instead of the dress Floral 51ğŸ˜”


Beautiful dress and colors are true!  Fit like a glove on her - 2x.


Love this dress! As a plus size gal j am always wearing of buying off the Internet but this dress is great! I bought two other styles by the same company and am impressed with all 3 dresses. If you are trying to decide if this is somethig you want. . Go for it!


I love this dress, but the ordering proportions are ridiculous. This said I was a medium or a large on its size chart; Iâ€™m usually an XS, so I ordered that. Despite it being an extra small, the bust was too too large, but overall itâ€™s very good.


Love the Dress, fits very well. Iâ€™m 5â€™3 220 lbs, I ordered a 2XL.


I always get compliments on this dress, especially when I wear it with a petty coat underneath. I bought the one by the same designer.


I liked this dress. I like the 50's inspired look now I have to get a pearl necklace


Fabric is excellent quality! Super cute!! I'm 5'0 and 95 lbs and the XS fit me perfectly! I feel like such a proper lady in it :-)


I normally wear an 18. Neither the XXL or XXXL would even zip. Disappointed because the dress was made well. Came as picturedâ€”just didnâ€™t fit.


I really like the dress,very nice fabric. Fits great.
