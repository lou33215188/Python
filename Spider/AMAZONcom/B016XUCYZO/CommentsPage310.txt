This dress is super cute and comfortable. I got the lemon pattern and it's so nice and summery. I got paranoid and ordered a size up, but I think I would have been fine with my true size. It's a forgiving fabric. Will definitely order more.


WOW - What a spectacular dress - quality is great and a wonderful value!  'm totally buying from them again!


This dress runs incredibly small.  The fabric is stiff and has no elasticity or give to it. Not a comfortable fabric.


Wife loves it, lots of complements


This dress is perfect. The length was great, the cut is great. The fabric is heavy but not weighed down. It looks even better with the grace Karin petticoat under it. Totally love this dress


sizes are small -- I should have ordered next size


Fits true to size. Great quality. My daughter is 5’ 31/2” and the dress comes right below knees. I ordered the petticoat which made it puff just and was can right above knee. It’s perfect for her occasion.


The dress fit perfectly. I used the chart measurements and it was exact. I was very happy with the quality of the fabric and the color. The color is a little more vibrant than the picture but still lovely.


But well made.


But beautiful
