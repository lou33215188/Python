i bought a black polka dot size 8 and its.perfect, true to the description. Also purchased with the slip in black.  Super cute.


The dress was lovely, I didn't expect the size to be so tight but I enjoyed wearing it. I would definitely buy again from this company.


I was impress that this dress fitted perfect , the only thing with this dress that u need to use a scotch Brite lint roller bc eveything stick on the dress.


Fits perfectly. The pattern of the fabric doesn’t line up exactly like the picture, and I loved the way the rose and greenery at the top in the picture. But it’s still a lovely dress.


I get so many compliments on this dress. Very flattering for my plus size figure. Comfortable, and can be worn with or without the under skirt.


Love the dress! I'm a size 12/14 and the xl fit great.


Really pretty


This dress is beautiful! I was surprised by the quality as well, as I wasn't expecting much for the price. I love White House Black Market, and let me tell you that the quality is just as great and for a fraction of the price!


The material is nice and thick. My daughter wore for the award ceremony for the school. She was stand out with the dress on the stage.


It's a pretty dress. The neck line is a bit higher than we expected.


I dont usually buy clothes online because of the fear of them not fitting. This dress fits like a glove not to tight or loose. Im inlove with it. I definitely will order more in different colors.
