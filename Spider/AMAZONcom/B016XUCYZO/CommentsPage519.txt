Skirt too wide, material not good quality.


Elegant and beautifully made!


A little tight for my size but very nice dress!


Love it!


A little small but Im losing weight!  If looking for your size then order a size up.


GF loved it, was just a size too small :)


There are too many wrinkles on it.


Just love this dress. I am 5 ft 2" & 116 pound. I bought small & fits me perfectly.  The length is just right at my knee.


I have fallen in love with this dress. It fits perfectly


This dress is the talk of any room I walk in to!! Never have I received so many compliments!
