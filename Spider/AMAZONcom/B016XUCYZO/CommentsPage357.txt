It fits well but its bot the material I expected.


Fits as expected, I chose not to purchase the layers for underneath the dress and it still flows nicely.


I measured myself and used the guide that they suggest to pick out a size one larger than I normally wear. I'm 5'10" and about 155 pounds. I ordered a large but it was much too big. I easily sent the dress back and got a medium. The dress is very simple. Just one piece of fabric but I like it a lot,


Daughter loved the dress


Material and cut was fine. Not a perfect size 2XX. Was very small for X'


Better in person. Fit as expected! LOVE IT


Satisfied.


i love the way this dress fits, the waist is somewhat snug but the rest of the dress fits as expected. Love the material and the colors in the dress. I can't wait to wear this dress.


A little big, but my daughter LOVES it!


This dress fits like a glove and looks absolutely beautiful.  The fabric and construction are a much higher quality than I expected on a dress at this price point.  I have ordered another in a floral print!
