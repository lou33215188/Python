Beautiful.  Amazing.  I adore this dress!


This dress was absolutely perfect for my bridal shower!!!!


It fit kind of tight at the top, but if I order a bigger size it will be too big. But,  I  will  make it work.I really like the dress.


It was the perfect dress for Valentine! She loved it!


I love it!!! So perfect. Great quality!


Beautiful dress!  It fits well!  It did not come with a belt, but it's beautiful without one as well!  I want to wear it everyday!


DO NOT BUY!!! Not only was the product too small (by several sizes) and poorly made, the seller only refunded half of my money because they are in China and didn't want to deal with the shipping. It's not worth the hassle.


Love Love Love this dress! Received tons of compliments.


The dress is so cute.  I was extremely disappointed that is was so large.  It seemed to be 1-2 sizes too large.  ğŸ˜­


Nice dress.... Way, way small!
