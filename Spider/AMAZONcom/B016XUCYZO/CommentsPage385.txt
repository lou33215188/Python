I love this dress! The quality of the dress is much better than expected for the price. I would pay $50 for this dress at a department store. (Or maybe more). I purchased a petticoat to go underneath it as well.


so cute


Not to small .. but a little short waisted!!


Love the fabric and style though.


Nice dress, usually wear X/XL, the dress XXXLis tight around the bust!


Didn't come with belt as pictured?


I'm usually a 12/14 and I ordered the X-LG just in case. Glad I did, I felt very comfortable with it feeling baggy


This dress is beautiful and I really really wanted it to fit. I read all the reviews and I ordered accordingly. The quality is outstanding. Unfortunately I couldn't even get it over my head and shoulders to try at on.


Love the dress fits great and well made.


This is the most beautiful dress and with the accessories it is perfect for the party I am attending


I love the fit but wish they sent it in a way where it didn't wrinkle. It was incredibly wrinkly and I did not have time to send it to the dry cleaners before the wedding I attended hoping to wear the dress. I'm happy to have it for future occasions.
