It's not as long as I wanted, but I suppose that's my fault for not measuring it correctly. Still, it's really cute, and I LOVE the black on white. The little belt cinches in my waist perfectly!


I love this dress, keep in mind I ordered up two sizes from what I normally would wear though.


This dress is simply wonderful! It fits perfectly (I'm 5'2, 115 lbs, size xs), great quality for the price!


5'6 155 lbs, fit perfectly. Belt is too long, but thats okay! Nicer fabric then what I was expecting.


I love the dress but it is too big.  I even followed the sizing chart that you had with the dress.


This worked perfectly for a bridal shower tea party. I had never bought clothing on amazon before and was skeptical, but the material is beautiful and the fit was perfect.


It's cute, thank you.


Amazing. It fits me perfectly.  I had lots of compliments.  I'm very happy


I love this dress. I feel so beautiful in it.


It fit perfectly and was great. It came just above my knees (I'm 5'8") and was comfortable. The fabric was not scratchy or anything and it was great to wear.
