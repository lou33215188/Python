Fits perfectly if you use the sizing chart under the dress picture! Very flattering, I love it!


The dress is super cute, the material very soft and it fits as expected. I loved it!


Fits me well.


Wonderful pick. I love it. It fit perfectly, and spins really nicely when dancing.


For the price, this dress is lovely! Pay attention to the measurements they provide and you won't be disappointed.


Dress was nice and looked exactly like pic. But too small could not zip. If ordering order a size bigger!


Dress was made great but sizing is WAY off! Bodice is tiny, skirt perfect. And I ordered a size larger.


Poorler quality than I expected. Fit large in the torso and definitely need ironing. I returned it


Beautiful!


I ordered a size large and the dress fits pretty good. A little tight in the bust area but it was a great fit. I will purchase another dress in a different color.
