The material is great, it looks like it will hang nicely with or without petticoats. Looking forward to having an opportunity to wear this somewhere! Gotta have one in every color!


This dress is a fantastic fit and is a great deal for the price. I will definitely be ordering it in different patterns!


A beautiful, well made dress, just didn't fit my wife very well.


The material feels a little cheap. It came folded and terribly wrinkled. I got a large based on my measurements and it's too big, it's also longer than described. I am returning it.


Nice look, feel, length and a good price


OMG so cute and so well made.


Love it!  Classy and cute for a small figure!


Love this dress!!!! So glad that I bought it. I usually dont trust online shopping, but I am really happy and satisfied of this company. You must know your proper size before buying it. Dress fits perfectly fine on me!!


Love it!!! Material is good, does not look cheap, workmanship is good. Just as it looks in the picture.


Very pretty dress! After washing by hand, it still looks like a new one. I will buy one more.
