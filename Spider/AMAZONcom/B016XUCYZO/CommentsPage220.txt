This dress was amazing. I wore to a wedding and it definitely served its purpose. Nice material


Great dress.  It is flattering on most body types.  Modest yet supremely feminine.  My only complaint is the super flimsy belt.  I tore it apart opening the package!  Also, be forewarned that these dresses are DRY CLEAN ONLY!  With 3 toddlers this is problematic in my household.


For special functions I wear it with a petticoat underneath.  This dress always receives compliments.


Great dress!! Fits perfectly!  Love the price!  I will be buying more of their dresses in the different fabrics they offer.


It came just as expected. I tried it on and the dress fit well and it was comfortable but, i didn't expect for it be very large when flared. Either way be sure to follow the sizing chart in the dress photos.


gave to good will - bummer and quality was very poor


Love love love this dress!  I get SO many compliments when I wear this dress!  It is comfortable and you can wear it with or without the petticoat underneath it.


Best dress I've ever had! It's true to size and absolutely gorgeous! I am trying to get used to this new body (gained 40 lbs) and I absolutely love the way I feel and look in this dress! I am planning to purchase another! Thank you!


super cute


The polka dots are pink, not red.... so a better description of the style might be helpful. My red petticoat will not match this. But it's am adorable dress and it's nicely made. It's a bit large on my Shoulders, but perfect everywhere else.


The collar sits a bit weird, but the dress is really cute and fits comfortably. I get many compliments on the dress when I wear it. It's also nice that it give that small waist silhouette.


It can get a bit wrinkly, but a quick steam will do it just fine.
