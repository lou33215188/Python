The dress looks like the photo. I love that the skirt naturally has a little volume to it. I did add a petticoat for extra volume.  I wear a size 14 in pants and I ordered a 1X just to be safe. The dress does fit a little on the big size for the 1X on me. The belt does nothing for the dress, honestly. I plan on just not wearing it at all.


LOVE this dress! Got it for my Halloween costume - Sally from Peanuts. Was worried it would be too dressy for both the costume & for me to wear again later, but it's a nice cotton sateen like fabric. Will definitely wear this in the summer to work & church. I'm 5'7" & 125 lbs, & the XS was a great fit. Amazing dress for the price!!


Beautiful dress and fits great! I'm 5' 4", 165lbs, 34c and the medium fit like a glove! I got a petticoat to wear under and it was the perfect addition but looks great even without one.


So beautiful, comfortable, fabric is in good quality, very classy.


Adorable!


I was shocked that this dress fit as well as it did. I was skeptical of making this purchase but did so based on the reviews. I am very happy that I purchased this dress.


This dress is perfect for me!  I did make a new belt and added a crinoline and it is my favorite thing.


The dress is pretty.


We added a blue ribbon and blue underskirt to give it more volume.


Fit was good.


the best!


Love this dress, I've gotten so many complaints wearing this dress. The belt makes it even classier.
