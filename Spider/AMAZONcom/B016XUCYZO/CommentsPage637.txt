so cute looks exactly as pictured once it is on


Top is not true to size


Did not liked how it fit.


Dug into my arms by my armpits


Super cute, great quality!


I wear a size 10 so the chart work for me.


Ordered 2x got a 4x


Love the way it fit......


Just as described. Perfect fit


One word: UGLY!


Need more? icky sticky nasty polyester fabric that is put together in a haphazard fashion resulting in the most ill-fitting. unflattering, shapeless  mess that looks nothing like the picture. I am an hourglass size 18...this made me look like I was wearing a black lawn and leaf hefty bag with a really law quality belt sizes too big for the dress.
