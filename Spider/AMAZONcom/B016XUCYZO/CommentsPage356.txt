True to the description! Very comfortable. I love it!!


This LBS works...dress up or down...great for work to evening


This dress is really beautiful and very well made.....I love that the fabric has a little stretch too........BUY THIS DRESS!!!!


This dress was perfect everything I hoped it would be! The material is nice a thick, but not to heavy! Iâ€™m pairing it with a petticoat and it just makes it even better!


This dress is made pretty well. Its worth what you paid for it. I'm 5'6'' and weigh about 130-135 and bought a size medium. it comes right to the knee.


looks so pretty on.


Great!


I really loved getting this dress!! A lot of places it is hard to know if there sizes are real to US sizes or not and this was perfect!! I would buy from here again!!


Its much thicker than it looks. I liked it in the pics here though. The size is large for my wife who is slim and is 5' 4". Returned.


The dress was perfect! I love the weight of the fabric. It is well made. It didn't come with a belt, but Amazon gave me a $5 credit to make up for it.
