I love it the bodice was short and didn't reach my waist other than that the was made for me


Absolutely love this dress. Gonna buy another. I got it for work, thought it might be a little too dressy, but it's perfect. Great quality


Exactly what I was looking for!  Perfect fit.  Looking forward to summer when I will be wearing it to an outdoor wedding.


The dress is really cute.  The top fits a little tighter than expected.  I ordered a large and usually wear a size 12.  It just fits snuggly!


I love this dress!!


Love this dress!


Lovely dress!


A little too big for me. Did not shrink after wash.


The colour was as expected, it just looked very underwhelming on.


The dress fit perfectly and I received plenty of compliments when I wore it.  I would buy another one.
