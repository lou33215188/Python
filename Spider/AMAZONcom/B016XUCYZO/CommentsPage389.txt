This dress is beautiful. I ordered it for my daughter to wear to church on tomorrow for Easter Sunday. It came this morning. She tried it on and it looks awesome. Great buy. I wish I had ordered one for myself.


I loved this dress. I bought it for a wedding and received multiple compliments. The way the top fit on my large chest was perfect. I was even able to zip it up by myself.


Good quality fabric with a little stretch, read the other comments and I'm in between sizes so to be sure I ordered a size up


A little snug, but I’m keeping it and losing weight, because I LOVE IT❤️!


I have ordered this dress in multiple colors now and continue to receive so many compliments for each one!! They fit perfectly and can wear with or without a petticoat! I love them!!


Fit perfectly! My sisters and I purchased different styles of the same dress for a high tea outing and we got SO MANY compliments. Highly suggest! Flattering on any body type for sure!


I love this dress! I get so many compliments when I wear it. Also does wonders to create the illusion of a waist if you're like me and are built like a ruler.


I wore this to Disneyland's dapper day and I got so many compliments and it was a very nice material. I'm 5"2 and 110 pounds and I ordered a size small and it fit me perfectly.


Beautiful,good quality fabric. I loved it


This is a beautiful dress my 14 yr old daughter wore it for Confirmation and she received many compliments on it.
