The material and craftsmanship are mediocre. It was a little tight and short for me. I purchased a petticoat to achieve the effect of the photo. Unfortunately, if I were to wear this dress with a petticoat, it would be way too short for me. I am 5'9". I bought this dress a few months ago and still haven't worn it because it is not at all flattering.


Looks very pretty on my granddaughter.  She wants me to purchase the petticoat to make it flounce underneath the skirt part of dress.  Very pleased with the product.


Such a great dress for the price!  It is quite lovely on.  The belt, as others have stated, is huge.  The fabric is sturdy.


This dress is amazing! I bought it for my bridal shower and absolutely love it!


Daughter wore for her graduation. Beautiful dress


The print is very nice but its hot and very snug


Fits great and very pretty.  My wife loves it.


I bought this dress for a wedding and it fits perfectly!! I'm usually a size 12-14 and 38DD, and I got an XL and it fit like a dream! Really cute with a petticoat, but very cute and elegant without as well. The fabric is thick and sturdy, you don't feel like your rolls are hanging out ( if you know what I mean, big girls). I recommend!


It's a great dress and I love it, but it runs a bit large. I'm 5'2, 117 lbs, and I bought the dress in Medium because I am a bit shapely (bust, hips, butt, all that.) The dress comes halfway down my calves- which makes me look about a foot shorter- and the top fits a bit awkwardly in the back. I'm gonna get it tailored because it's very well made, but I would try getting a size or two smaller than you would normally wear. I do love this dress though, and had I known about the size thing, I would've gotten a Small or XS and it would've been 5-star perfect


I got tons of compliments on this dress. Very feminine!
