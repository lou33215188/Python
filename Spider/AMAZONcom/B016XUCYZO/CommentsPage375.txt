Love it!!  Twirl & twirl & twirl....at the blk/white galaâœŒğŸ�½


Material is very scratchy.


The quality of the fabric feels comfortable. I love it.


The dress was awesome!!!!! It made me feel so comfortable and beautiful. Thank You.ğŸ’‹


I absolutely love this dress! It's a bit snug in the breast area but I'm big busted so I expected that. It still fits lovely and I'm excited to wear it! I will be ordering another one! Thank you!!


I own 2 of these and fully intend to get more!


Loved it, it fit perfectly and I got a lot of compliments. I did not like the belt that came with it at all.


I love this dress. I normally don't buy a dress online in fear it won't fit right but this dress is perfect. I wore it to a wedding and it was really comfortable. I received many compliments.


It was to small and I went by the measurements on the size chart.


The fit was somewhat large for my build and the skirt was a bit long for my taste but it was good quality and a great material.
