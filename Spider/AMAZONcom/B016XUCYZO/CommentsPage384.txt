It fits beautifully however I didnâ€™t receive the belt that was supposed to come with it ğŸ˜�


I just loved the color , the fitting !!! Everything was perfect!


Bust 44", waist 35-36ish", and 3XL(not 3x) fits like a charm. The material is not see through either.


Dress fits perfectly, I got so many compliments. Buy the petticoat to make it full.


Perfect


I bought this dress for my mom. Although it was a little big she still loved it. We just took it to the seamstress to have it altered


Item is cut small around the arms.  Otherwise it would have been perfect.  If you have thick arms and wear a size 10/12.  This medium may not work for you. Try getting a large.


Beautiful dress, loved it, but the top was a couple of inches too small.  So I gave it to my Daughter in law.  Fit her really nice.


Great


Very classy dress. I will purchase another one.
