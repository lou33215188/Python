Adorable, but I have yet to wear it as I have no idea where it's practical haha


Soft and so pretty!!


This dress is wonderful, I got so many compliments! I wear 18/20, so ordered 1x, it was perfect, even in the bust where I usually have trouble. Will definitely order in other colors!


Beautiful  dress. A must buy!


I just love this dress but it runs a size or two small


I wear a 20 to 22 in tops. This dress fits perfect. I love the look.


Loved pattern but I am 5'8" amd the waist line was at my breasts and it looked 10 months preggo.


Super cute! I liked it so much I ordered another one right away. Really flattering fit!


Dress was way shorter then expected it fit great tho but needs length especially if you are curvy below the waistline


great quality, made well, fabric has excellent weight, very generous sizing I love it!
