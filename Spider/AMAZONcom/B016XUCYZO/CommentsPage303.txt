Just received the dress and it's absolutely perfect! I'm beyond excited. The colors, quality and fit are amazing and it arrived on time (2 days). Will definitely be purchasing more from this seller specifically!


I LOVE this dress!! I want to buy several in different patterns. I got so many compliments. I wore it to our swing dancing party with a white petticoat underneath it. Super comfortable and I'm going to wear it to other things as well without worry that it will look like a costume.


Love the dress, it fit fairly well. I would say if you have breasts at all get it a little bit larger. I'm a 32D and while the dress fits overall very well I have to either wear no bra or a completely unlined bra just to fit in the dress.


Cute. Size 16 should order 1x


Nice fit! but one dress that I order it together  they cancel it. Thats why, I a little  bit  upset.


Great dress! The only reason it was not 5 stars is, I wish it was lined. Pockets would make it a 10!!


Love it


The skirt was waaaay fuller than I expected.  The top was nice, but about half as much skirt would have still been full.


This dress is amazing! Great fit great quality!! I weigh 153 and I am 5'4 I ordered a Medium and it fits a little snug but still very well Im actually dieting so if I lose 1-2 pounds it will fit perfectly!!


I love this dress!! I ordered it to wear to an upcoming wedding.  I ordered a 3X hoping it would at least be a 2X on me and it worked! The material is high quality and it's very flattering.
