Perfect fun swingâ€‹ dress. Great quality, very flattering on.


Just received it today. The quality is very good. Looks like $100 dress.


The dress is beautiful.  However, the top portion is sized too small for women with larger busts.


Love this dress.  Mine just barely fits over my chest, so definitely go up a size if you're well endowed.


I love this dress


This is the second dress I've bought in this style. Love the colors, great quality, and looks great on my body.


This dress has a beautiful print fabric, but it wrinkled easily. Also, the dress runs a little small. I wear a size 4 and the small was quite tight.


Husband loved it! Looks great for a cocktail event


I loved this dress. It looks just like the photo and it fit just as expected. Buy it in every color.


too small.  don't like material but love the design.
