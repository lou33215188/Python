Very nice


The dress was under sized.


Wine color... accurate & beautiful. Thick fabric but not heavy when wearing. No petticoat need, fit perfectly and can be dressed up. Wore to wedding, loved it


The material is not nice at all.


And it fits weird.


I did like the boat neck.


If you're on the heavier side don't buy.


Well done. Classy, sweet and sexy. A great combination.


loved, loved the look of the dress but it was why too small. Only wish this came in plus sizes.


Beautiful dress, great value!


The red is a red rose, true red color. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the belt is way too long for the dress. After buckling it, it still wrapped half way round the dress.


Nothing short of glorious. I just wish I had somewhere to wear it!


Beautiful polka dot dress. Fits very well,I normally wear 12-14 bought size L. Everyone is asking where I got the dress.
