Really cute and fit everywhere except the bust. I'm a DD and the front area of the bodice has so little room, the waistline rode up all the way to an empire, which you can see on some of the other photos of curvy girls who bought this dress. My advice- if you want the waistline to be at your actual waist- don't buy this dress if you are a C cup or over. The princess lines are just too shallow. If you are not busty, the fabric is good and the quality nice.


It was not what I expected it was really bad it was another type Of material and it wasn't pretty


Dress was too big and did not fall well. I was disappointed.


Love it!!


Absolutely love the material!!!


Love this dress!!! Got so many compliments!!!!


Dress is overly short for my taste.  I prefer length to hit closers to my knee.


Perfect for a bridal shower!


Zipper broke when I tried it on never got to wear total waste of money


The material is very high-quality and the size was right on the dot
