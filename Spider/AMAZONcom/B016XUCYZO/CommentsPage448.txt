I am giving it just 1 star because it was too small and I didn't spend much time with it, but I did like the way it looked and the feel of the fabric.


Adorable dress. The zipper was defective and wouldn't stay on track. Very disappointed as I had a specific event I wanted to wear this to.


Great


Order according to your measurements and it fits perfectly! Ordered as a Easter dress, and it was a hit. I'll be ordering more dresses from this seller in the future for church dresses!


I bought this dress for my mom and it looks great on her. We both like it


The quality of the dress was great.


Love it and fits good!


Ordered for Daughter. She wears 0-1, ordered xs,  fits perfect.


Love this dress! It fits me perfectly & is very flattering.
