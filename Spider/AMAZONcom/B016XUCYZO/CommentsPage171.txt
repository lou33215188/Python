Although it runs a little small up top - I was expecting this due to others reviews.  It is such a cute dress and I got a lot of compliments.  It is heavier material so beware if you are looking for something light.


Loved the quality. I'm returning it since it doesn't fit my body. I followed the chart but it's too loose in the chest even if it fit other places. Probably would get a 5 if it fit like normal.


The print I got (roses & polka dots) is beautiful. It's also probably the only dress I've gotten off of Amazon where the skirt is as full as it looks in the photo! I've worn & washed it several times now & it seems to be holding up just fine :)


My fiance went up a size, because vintage clothing usually is very tight. But the material is stretchy like cotton. So had she gotten a 3x instead of a 4x, it would have been the perfect fit. But it's not that big of a gap, she'll can just pin in a few places. But she is so in love. I'm going to buy all of them, wish me luck men!!!!!


sooooo cute was made for me


I am a 5"4 118lbs and bought a m fit perfect loving the colour too


fabric is lovely


I love the dress but the fit wasn't right. Runs a bit large.


Very attractive on .  Teenager loved it .  Wore it to a dance.


Dress is beautiful. True fit to size. Material is a good quality. Colors are bright. So worth the price!


Wore it to a bridal shower and I got many compliments.


It's a cute dress, but it didn't fit as snugly as I am used to. The length goes past my knees, which I was happy with, but overall the product wasn't how I anticipated it fitting on me.


I am 5'8", 140 lbs, who wears a 36C. I was skeptical about whether the Large would be too big but it fits perfectly. I might eventually get this taken in at the sides but it is the single best thing that I have bought off of Amazon and I am going to buy it in a few other colors once the weather warms back up in the spring.
