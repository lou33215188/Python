Pretty dress but too flat of a style in the bust. Way too small and I even ordered a size up just in case. If you have a small bust you'll likely wear this much better. I can not at all.

I received many compliments. Great for large chested gal. Bought the petticoat as it makes the dress. No belt was shipped but that is an easy fix.  Fabric is soft and good quality for the price.


very cute and well made! Very happy with it.
