Reviews were right, this dress it PERFECT! I ordered a medium and it fit wonderfully. Love the floral accents and the fit. Wore it to a derby party and gt so many compliments. I will for sure order more of these dresses.


I bought this for the rehearsal dinner of an upcoming wedding.  I can't wait to wear it!  The fit is great (not too snug in the top, as I'm a little busty, and cute as can be.  As mentioned in other reviews, the belt is not great, but I plan to use a bright belt to add a splash of color anyway.


I loooove love love this dress! It's so comfortable to wear in the heat of Florida. I will be purchasing this in several other prints.


It's a great dress-- really well put together for its price, very flattering lines. However, if you're above a D cup, you won't without some uniboob. I'm of a larger bust and though it zipped up, it was pretty unflattering up top. I had to return it. So be aware!


Love this product, thanks so much!


I want another one. If you're not sure if you should get it, don't hesitate. Buy it!!!! Measurements are accurate and it's soooooo cute.


Runs true to size, love the look, I know it will be a favorite!


my daughter loves this dress on me.  I wear it to work and it's light enough to wear in the summer, and nice enough to wear for work and play.


I’m 5,9 130lb (or less), S fits me perfectly as expected. The price can be better on Ali if you’re not in a rush.


Fit to a tee, if I gain no weight before I wear it. It is beautiful and made so well.
