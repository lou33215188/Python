This dress is amazing. The fabric feels nice, the cut is beautiful, and I received so many complements. I am between sizes so I went with the medium and it fits well. (For reference 5â€™5â€� 36d 142). The belt is starting to have the velvet like covering pull off, but replacing it with a belt of my own is no problem. I have already ordered another in a different color.


My first order. I'm loving my dress. The order came a lot sooner then expectedğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾. I'm a very happy camper. I'll be ordering more dress. I just wish the other style dresses and skirts were in my size. Hopefully the styles will still be in stock during my weight watchers journey ğŸ¤—


My second order. I went from a 3x to a 2x. It fits amazingly well with my shape and Yes I'm still on my weight watchers journey. Hope to be in the next size down soon.


Love this dress! The high waist makes for a flattering fit.  I'm 5'6, 125 -the small fits well. The bodice is snug- might want to size up if you need more space.


I don't like the belt and it looks great without it. I bought two more.


Very good quality! Fit a little bigger than I would want. But I haven't had it dry cleaned yet so well see how it fits afterwards. But great quality and stiching, great buy!


A little worried by some of the reviews, I ordered a size over what I normally would. This one is kinda big for me but not unwearable, and I can always take it in a little bit. The material is soft and thick, though, and I love the happy print.


Gorgeous dress.  I did buy a petticoat to go along with the dress and it fits great.  It fits me right in all the right places.  I can't wait to wear it.


I bought this for my daughter's birthday because she LOVES the old I Love Lucy shows - and she was absolutely delighted with it.  The dress fit her very well and was well made with a good feel to the fabric and great finishing on seams, etc.  It was much nicer than I had expected and she is already eyeing some of the other colors.  She is wearing a petticoat 


with it and that adds a lot of flair.


The neck and back across the very top is "gappy" unless you pull the straps all the way apart to the edge of you shoulder. I like the material, easy to iron but it wrinkles the instant you sit down. My normal size is 18 (40D bust) and this fit great.


this dress is lovely. I bought it for my fiancÃ©e and man oh man I love how it looks on her!


5'9" and 130 lbs.  36C. Fits great. Bought petticoat for underneath to poof out the skirt. The pattern is nice and it is put together well.
