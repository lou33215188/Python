I bought this dress for a Kentucky Derby Party. It's perfect! The fit is exactly as described, and despite it being white, it's not see-thru.


Love the dress perfect for the 50's party


I absolutely love the way this dress fit me. Perfect and it is the actual size.


Loved the dress. It fits wonderfully.


Fit great.


Dress was ok. Material doesn't seem of the best quality but hey! what was I expecting for the price.


I loved the material quality, the cut, the likeness to the picture and the fit was unbeatable. Can't wait to order again!


Top fits perfect but makes your bottom side look huge!!!


Beautiful dress. Fit perfectly.


Cheap material. Otherwise, cute print.
