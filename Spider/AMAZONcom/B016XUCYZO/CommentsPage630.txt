Nice feel to fabric and pretty pattern.  The dress is unlined but not see through.  I wear a size 6, I'm 5'3, can usually wear a size 4 in a dress and I purchased the medium.  The top fits snugly although not tight, snug under the arm and the waist is more empire.  Mine arrived with a black, velvet belt that was the correct size.  If I was to reorder I would try the large for a bit more ease through the top.  On a teen this probably would fit perfectly.


Terrible material, sizes posted do not reflect accurate sizing. Cheaply made.


It was not at all like the picture. The cut was different and the material was a very cheap polyester instead of the high-quality cotton like the description claimed. Poor quality and very disappointing.


Best dress I've ever bought online not just on Amazon but anywhere. It's gorgeous, fits perfect, and highlights all the right areas. Buy this dress!!


I loved this dress but it just wasn't my style.


Great summer dress


Absolutely love the dress! I am a 32A 122lbs and the extra small fits perfect. The only thing is the belt that came with it is a bit on the long side


Super cuuuute!! The dress delivery was a day late, but totally fine. I got it for a tea party bridal shower. It fits perfectly.. I just love it!! :) I


This dress is super comfy and beautiful. However, the only negative was that mine did not come with a belt as advertised. Not a huge deal, I still love it. But that is my only complaint!


As soon as it arrived, got it on and loved it right away:) very satisfied with my purchase:)
