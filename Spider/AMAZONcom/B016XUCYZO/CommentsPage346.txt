Love this!  I wish there were petite sizes.  I'm 5'2" and or sits below my knee.  It would look better at the knee.


Loved it the only reason it gets a four because the flowers look read but the are pink


Beautiful dress!!


If you have a big bust like myself (44 DDD) this is not the dress for you.


I’m 5’6”, and wear about a 12/13 in pants and ordered a large. It fits like a glove! It’s so cute and summery, I absolutely cannot wait to wear it out in public.


I got so many compliments on this dress! It was a bit big on me so a few alterations will be done. Other than that, it was a fabulous dress and very comfortable.


Great dress for the price! Received it quickly, well packaged & quality was better than expected.


Beautiful. I got so many compliments on this dress. Made wonderful. It washed well. Now it’s my favorite going out dress.


Super dress. I couldn't believe the quality when I got it. It looks really expensive and fits nicely.


Love it. Usually wear 10-12 large fit fine
