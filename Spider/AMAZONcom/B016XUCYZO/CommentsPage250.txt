Beautiful, vintage dress!! Wearing it again tomorrow!! Would buy again!


Very nice dress. Got it for Easter, and it was perfect! It is a white background, and thick material so you don't see through it. Fits according to size chart, and only a little stretchy.


Perfect when it arrived, but it does shrink in the wash... beware. I'll be repurchasing.


Super cute and form-fitting!  I love it!


Love this dress! Well made and super cute!!!!


Fit fine everywhere except in the bodice. About a size smaller in the bodice compared to the rest of the dress.


This dress fits great and looks great.


This dress far beyond exceeded my expectations. And for the price it's a steal. One of my new favorites for sure!


I purchased this dress for my daughter who is a size 10/12.  We took her measurements and followed the chart, XS.  It was a perfect fit for her!
