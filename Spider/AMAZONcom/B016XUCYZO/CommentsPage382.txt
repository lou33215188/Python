I had already purchased this dress in a different print  ( and loved it) and was expecting the new dress to fit the same and was very disappointed to try it on and have it be way too small!


I really love this dress. The fit is perfect, and a nice summer dress for the cost. Beautiful with a petticoat as well!


I bought it for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it and it fits perfect with a little stretch to it.


Took a gamble on your stress. But it paid off. The quality of the material is beyond our expectations for the price. Definitely buying other dresses and other colors from the same brand


This dress is so BEAUTIFUL in person! Well made and fits perfect! It was purchased to be my Easter Dress and it did not disappoint!!!


Very good quality. Fits true to size. I'm a 14-16 and I got a1x size. Looks cute on.


The material is soft and sturdy, and the dress fits like a dream. I'm 5'2 and a size 4, and the medium is exactly the right size. The fabric has a little give. What worked for me: using my measuring tape & selecting size using their size chart! I can't wait to wear this beauty!


The length was good, and it looks good on


So pretty! So excited to wear for Easter.


Absolutely love it. Got a lot of compliments!
