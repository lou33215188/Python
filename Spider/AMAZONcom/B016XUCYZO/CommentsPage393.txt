love this dress it's so cute great for summer love the full skirt absolutely adorable


the color of the dress is darker then the photo shows but I still really like it just was expecting more of a light blue.


I love it! The fabric is thick and it is full even without a petticoat. Grace Karin dresses rock!


Bought large fits well. 5'3 145 lbs, 34DD.  The tag says dry clean and I believe website says handwash. Petticoat is a very nice touch. May consider one of the prints if it washes well.


Beautiful fabric,  sizing runs really small, the 3x is still tight on some one who wears an American xl


Perfect event dress.  Fabric is a thick sateen.  A bit too fancy for a work meeting, but I still might go for it one of these days.


Fit perfectly, got an XXL, typically a size 18, 36DDD bust. Super flattering.


It's okay I won't be ordering from the company again.


Very pretty.


Great dress! Wore it for a Mad Men themed party and got rave reviews. I will continue to wear it to other functions as it is needed. Wore my own belt with the dress as the one that came with it was too skinny and long.
