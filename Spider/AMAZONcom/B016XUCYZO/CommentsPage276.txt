My granddaughter loves her dress...its for her 8th grade Prom Dance & she looks absolutely beautiful in this dress with a petticoat, small lace gloves, her '50s Wedge heels & a small Pillbox Hat... a KNOCKOUT!


BEAUTIFUL dress!  The quality of the dress was not chiffon which was good, and it actually very pretty.


Not very flattering on A frame women. Cheapo material, looks fake, polyester not cotton.


This dress fits so well and it is very cute on! The material is a bit thin (not see through, just not sturdy or anything), but I really like how it looks!


Not only is this dress inexpensive, it is super high quality and fit perfectly!  I wore it for my friends wedding as a bridesmaid (along with several other women), and we all loved our dresses. We looked fabulous in them too (lol). I highly recommend this one.


Beautiful dress love it,love it


I'm TOTALLY IN LOVE with this dress! The prints are bright, material has just enough thickness and its flows and fits PERFECTLY! WORE IT TO EASTER WORSHIP!


Whatever size you normally are, buy a size smaller!  i'm a small and needed an extra small in order for this dress to fit.


My daughter typically wears a small. But her waist measurement was a little big according to the size chart, so we went with the medium. Also, other reviews were conflicting on whether the fabric had any stretch. The fabric does have a little stretch and the small would have been a better fit. But it really doesn't matter. The dress is super cute.


I was glad I went up in size! It still was little snug but looked good! If your little buster like me go, up on size! Other than that, love the dress, and received many compliments!!
