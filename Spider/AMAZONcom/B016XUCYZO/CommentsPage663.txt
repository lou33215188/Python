Just saying this is cheaper on wish got it in just a few days.


Dress fit perfectly. There was some difficulty in getting the zipper over the change in fabric/seam at the waist but otherwise it was beautiful. Nice heavy fabric. Dry clean only.


Ran a little tighter then I thought it would but not bad


It's a great dress but I got the wrong size for it.


This dress just perfect on me. I like the patterns. Very beautiful! The fabric is soft, Very comfortable.


The cut and fit is awesome. It's true to size and I love how comfy it is. It's not too hot because the fabric is somewhat lightweight


Love love love this dress! Good quality, quick delivery. Got tons of compliments on it.


5'7 and 160lbs size M fit like a glove!


Perfect fit and fast delivery!!!! AwesomeğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š!!


Too tight in the arms, but otherwise fit well.
