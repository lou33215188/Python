Love it Love it Love it, going to order more.


Fabric is wonderful but it was too small


Such an awesome and quality made dress!!  I can't wait to wear it and shop this seller again!!


It is a nice, well-made dress for young, slim and tall ladies. It did not look nice on me. I am going to return it.


I was so happy with this dress! It came on time, has a gorgeous pattern and a flattering shape. It is a little thin on the skirt, you might need a slip. The belt is also a bit cheep, but no big deal!


I love it! Great fit n good material!


I recommend this dress so much . It's beautiful & comfortable . I love the fabric & the style .


This dress was the same size as the other 4 dresses I bought in a similar style, but this was way too small.


Beautiful and we'll made but a lot larger than I expected.
