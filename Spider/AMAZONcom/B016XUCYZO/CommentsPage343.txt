My grand daughter really liked this dress.


It's GORGEOUS. Fits as expected.


I love it. I measure 40 inch bust and 35 inch waist. Usually between a 12 or 14 dress size. This in an XL fit perfectly.


Such a beautiful dress! I bought this dress for my daughter to wear for her Christmas concert.  She received many compliments!  Love the classic look.


Very impressed with this dress! The material was a little scratchy but with a quick wash and some fabric softener, it was improved. I am 5'9" and 170 lbs - I ordered a size Large and it was perfect.


It is a nice dress.  The fit is good. But I got some other dresses I like even better.


I was pleasantly surprised that this dress it. I've gotten a lot of complements wearing this dress. Cannot wait to get another


Returned, as it did not fit very well (the waist sat way too high).


I loved it fits nice!


I wore this dress for Easter, for a Tea Party, then to work with flats and a cardigan. This dress is one of the most functional items in my closet! I always receive compliments when I wear it, what a steal for the price!
