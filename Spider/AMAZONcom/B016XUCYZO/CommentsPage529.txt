Did not have a belt.


Very nice dress. Material is great. Seems to be very well made.


Love it!!!


What a cute dress! We love it. Was just what it said it was.


Fit perfect, looked great with a petticoat underneath. Heavy cotton material, dry clean only.


this dress is great in many ways, it fit my 41-34-41 -5'3" body perfectly, no pulling across the bust, slightly roomy at the waist so I could eat, lovely pattern, comfortable, covers all cleavage. While i like an empire waist and also love circle skirts, they do not work together, on me anyway. From the side I look pregnant, from the front I look wider than I am. I tried a wide belt, but that didn't work. So maybe if you are very thin, or very short this would be a good buy.


I like it so much that I am thinking of buying a solid color and having the shoulder straps lowered a bit so it reaches near to my true waist.


I love this dress!!


Loved it. Perfect!


perfect fit


Wow! Very impressed. Material is nice and seems way more expensive than it was. I want to buy 10 more now!
