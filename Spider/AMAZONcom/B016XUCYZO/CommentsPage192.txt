I love the dress I ordered a size larger thinking it ran small, but dress was too large.  dress must be true to size. I love the dress will have someone to take it in for me. I do not want to wait for it to send it back. very happy


Words cannot describe how much I LOVE this dress! It fit perfectly. I am going to buy this dress in several other colors. This is my new favorite dress!


Perfect fit very comfortable and pretty


Didn't fit, and the material is low quality.


The dress is stylish and fits well. However, the zipper sticks badly and it wouldn't take much for it break.  I am going to return it.


I loved this dress, When I first ordered it I couldn't tell that it was lemons on the dress until I actually got it. I didn't think I would like it just looking at it but It turned out well once I had it on. And since I'm a lil plump it helps to cover my midsection well. Take a look at the pics.


Super super cute dress. So flirty. It is, somewhat, a lot of fabric, but it's nice! Perfectly constructed. My gal pal asks me where I got it from.


Bought this dress in the blue floral, size extra large (I'm a curvy size 14) for a church tea party. It is a little shorter than I expected (and I'm only 5'4") but other than that it fit perfectly!  I received many, many compliments at the event. Very pleased with my purchase.


This dress is so cute I bought a second one just like it because I always want to own one


It's a little big, mostly in the top of the dress.  Other then that it is actually much nicer then I expected and I would definitely recommend it to others.
