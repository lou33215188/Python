The dress fit like it was suppose to, I should have brought a large instead of medium because of my board back. But the dress was amazing and I received lots of compliments


I got a lot of compliments on this dress. Gorgeous colour. It has to be worn with the petticoat to get the full effect.

Absolutely beautiful! I am really looking forward to wearing this all summer long.


I loved the dress it fit a little small but I could still fit in it..the problem for me was it was way to short in the back! :( If you're well endowed in the backside area this dress is not for you unless you put a cancan under it..maybe!


Good material. Bright colors,  but runs small.


Very pretty dress, and the quality was better than anticipated for such a reasonable price. I will definitely shop this brand in the future.
