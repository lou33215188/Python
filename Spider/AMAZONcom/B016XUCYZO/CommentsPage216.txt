Great dress, well made, fit perfectly, my daughter is 5'9" and this dress came down to her knees.  Do not put in the dryer though, it will shrink 3" in length


Very cute on and washes well


Looooove this dress. It's true to size. I've never had so many compliments on a dress before! You should definitely get the recommended petticoat. So glad I listened to other reviewers. Now I'm looking for more in other colors :)


Too small so canâ€™t really give a fair review


So cute! Great material and quality. A cheap price for a great dress


Looks exactly like the picture.  Simple lines. Made of cotton, perfect for summer.  Not too heavy.


Purchased for granddaughter. She loves dresses and really loved this one. It looked amazing. Quality fabric and nice pattern.


Beautiful dress, seems to be made well. It's dryclean. Looks cut as is or looks even cuter paired with a petticoat.  Nice vintage dress! :D


The dress arrived early than expected. I wish I would have ordered a smaller size because it was way too big. I actually had to get it taken in some and it still to big. Other than that I love the dress. The  dress was made very well. I loved the feel and how the dress flows. I received so many compliments. I'm placing an order for two more dresses.


Love Love Love! Fits like a gloveğŸ˜Šâ�¤Absolutely LOVE My 50's purple rose print dress you can wear it out to eat or church or a party! Great quality material and very well made. Would highly reccomend with a 50's tulle skirt underneath and marry Jane heels to match.
