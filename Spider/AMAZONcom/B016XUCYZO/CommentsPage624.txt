Needs to be taken in. Waist is 3" too large. Bust is baggy. The size smaller wouldn't have given her enough "give" in the bust.


The fabric is not as light and flowy as it look on the picture.  It OK enough to not return but would not buy it again..


Dress is exactly as described, fits nicely and looks good... can't wait to order more


Waist was up on my boobs.  Not made for tall women I guess.  Had to return it.


This one needs an option to add more stars! People I had never met at my job were leaving their desk just to see it! I wore a petticoat under it and it looked amazing, just like the picture. LOVE LOVE LOVE


This dress fits well and seams to be made well.(I haven't sent to the dry cleaners yet) I followed the measurement chart and purchased a 3xl eventhough I generally wear a US size 18. I purchased two- one in black and one in the purple rose print.


It's really soft and fits great. The petticoat is a must! I wear a size 14/16 normally. I am 5-8" around 200lbs and I wear a 38B cup. I purchased the XXL in dark blue and I love it!!!


The top was too small and I did alter it, it was a bit shorter than planned and my husband didn't want me to wear it because the dress looked younger than I actually am.  He felt people would laugh that an old woman wore such a young dress. I still want to try and wear it sometime because I didn't think that it was too young.  Felt cool in it when I tried it on.


Beautiful dress, did not fit and had to return.


Although a beautiful dress, the size was smaller than expected. It was supposed to have been my mom's Mother's Day gift. She's trying to determine how to get a replacement.
