I love this dress! Fit perfectly! My husband thinks I look wonderful in it. Thinking of buying more in different colors. Have to take it to the cleaners because of the wrinkles from the packaging but that's expected when you order online. Zipper sometimes gets jammed but overall, I am impressed on the quality and the price.


The pattern was cute, but the dress was way too large and too long.  I had to return it.


I wore this dress for Easter and I received SO many compliments. The material seems very high quality and I'm still shocked it was only $30. I will definitely buy more from this company.


Loved it but returned. The black dye on the front ran onto the white during production so I didn't even take it out of the package cause I noticed it.


The first time I ordered this dress I bought a size up because I am very large in the bust and wanted to make sure it would accommodate that. After receiving the dress, and buying other dresses in similar styles from this seller, I have determined that it runs true to size. It is a beautiful dress, and very well made.


Very comfortable and flattering. I wear it for dancing.


I had a girls night out with some friends and this dress was perfect for it. It's pretty true to size and goes just below my knees (I'm 5'4). I really couldn't be happier with this purchase


This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering for curvy figures.  I'm 5'1", around 190lbs, 42D bra and carry my weight in my midsection. The 1X fit great. It was a little big in the shoulders but nothing terrible. The length came down just  passed my knees but not quite mid-shin. I also got tons of compliments too.


Brought this dress for my daughter's 11th birthday party


She has on a size xs. Excellent buy!!


PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT
