I bought it for my 16 yr old granddaughter. She loved it and it looks great on her.


Beautiful!


Only thing I was disappointed about was the belt! One size fits all does not fit all. :(


Love this dress, fit me just right, I ordered medium, I am 5'5, 143 pounds, bust 34 D.


Absolutely adore this dress. Just what I was looking for.


Love IT!  True to size


Im 165cm and 49kg, the small size is a little bit large, wish this could help others.


Perfect fit - comfortable and flattering. Got lots of nice comments.


Beautiful dress


This dress has beautiful fabric.
