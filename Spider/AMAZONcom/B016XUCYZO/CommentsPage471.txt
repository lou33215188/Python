I LOVED the dress, but it was way big .. I should have ordered just Xlg . I would appreciate a reorder


Looked exactly like the picture. Fit great! I love this dress!


love, love love it!!!


I got an XL just in case it ran small but I believe a large would have worked. It looked great though anyways.


This dress fits like a glove! I followed the sizing chart and could not be happier!  Will be buying more dresses soon!!!


i love it. perfect fit


Fit perfectly! Great for a pear shape!


Nice feminine dress just love it


I love the dress! The zipper however does not seem to be very sturdy.


Love this dress. Very Audrey Hepburn style as described. Fits great.
