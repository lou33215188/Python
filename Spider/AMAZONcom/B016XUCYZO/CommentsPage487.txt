Very pretty dress, well made, and a great value! Just follow the sizing chart to get the correct size.


My daughter picked out this beautiful dress online, however it was longer on her than she expected and the waist was too large. However, it fit perfectly around the top, arms, and neck line. Unfortunately I will need to return it.


Awesome, pretty and very comfortable. the only problem is the zip, it's a little stiff, but other than that great buy.


This dress surpassed my expectations! It feels and looks great on! I will definitely be buying more!


got a lot of complements on it. wish it was better fabric though.


Perfection!!!!


LOVE. This dress is gorgeous and fits awesome. Perfect Easter dress!


love it. was exactly what I was wanting, couldn't be happier with the fit or the semi stretch material.


Am a bit short so it feels a tad longer than expected but nothing a quick folding can't fix


flawless
