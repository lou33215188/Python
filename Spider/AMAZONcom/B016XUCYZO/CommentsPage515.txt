Made very well.  Does run a little small


It fits great. I bought a size small. I'm 5'7, 135lbs. I was a bit worried after reading other reviews, but I'm glad I went with a small.


However, I haven't even worn it yet and some of the stitch work is coming undone.


Love the look and fit. Great service.


The product looked better on the photo than in person. I was not impressed with this item.


I ordered this dress for my daughter's 16th birthday party. She is between a size 1 and 3 (U.S. sizes). The xs fits her perfectly! She loves the dress and so do I.


Very happy with the fit and the fabric. Very well made and great full skirt


Beautiful dress.  True to size. I absolutely love it and it came on time as stated.


Love this dress. Tons of compliments when I wear it.


This dress is an amazing fit! I'm 5'6" and 137lbs. Lot's of compliments :)
