A beautiful dress. The pattern was very clear and wasn’t muggy. I’m 5’4 and weigh 125 pounds and I ordered a medium but it was a tad bit large, but still wearable! Perfect for Easter. :)


This dress is Cheaply made and the material is like a table cloth... not flattering at all.. the underneath is not even the same pattern as the dress... the pattern is only on one side..


This dress is classic and pretty. It's a little big around the bust and back. Very well made. I'll be ordering again in different colors.


Beautiful.  Wonderful quality.  Looks great with tulle.


The color is a little darker than it shows, but prettier.  The material is thicker and nicer than expected.  It does have some stretch to make it fit nicely.  We also got the original GRACE KARIN dress.  I like how full the skirt can be, even without the petticoat.  It's also nice how the belt is included.


Use the measurement chart to determine size and it will fit perfectly.


Love this dress! I will order again.


The belt is missing..  I will really have to jazz this dress up


Love love love this dress. Perfectly retro. Minus a star because it did not come with belt.


No lining on the dress. It's a cute dress though. Colors are bright.
