Cute dress but bodice is way too short; does not come to the waistline so I had to send it back. I am not long waisted, btw.  I would think a slip with this dress would be necessary.


This was for my mother, she loved it.


I love this dress I havenâ€™t wore it to the event I bought it for. When I tried it on I fell in love.


Always like this designer


Ordered this dress in the white with the red roses so I had to order the black with the red roses....I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS DRESS AND THE VENDOR!!!  I followed the sizing chart and the fit was perfect. I get so many compliments on these dresses.  I will be ordering more.


My daughter love the dress.


The material is lovely and the fit is fantastic. My shoulders and bust are a bit smaller than the top but the dress overall fits like a dream. Very satisfied with the purchase and would buy again!


Love, love ;pve


The material is really nice and so is the cut of the dress. Great buy for the price. Love it!


Loved item
