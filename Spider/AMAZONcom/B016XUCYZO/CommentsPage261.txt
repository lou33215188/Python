beautiful dress! fits perfect!


Very Very pretty dress! My husband loves it! I can't wait to wear it to Church on Sunday! :)


My girlfriend loved it but it was too big. I had to have it altered.


It fits beautifully my TALL girl...classy


Great vintage dress. Fits my large frame perfectly. A little ironing and it was ready to go. Really cute with the petticoat! So much fun.


This dress is gorgeous in person! Extremely well made and was packaged very well. It will be a perfect dress for my daughter's graduation ceremonies coming up in about a month!


Very nice dress! however the only con is that the waist sits a little bit high. You will need a belt to make it look good.


Nice dress. The color is as expected. However, the size is a true disappointment. I usually wear XXL but the XXL didn't fit too small by the bust. People buying should consider one size up especially if they have a large bust as I do.


Super cute dress, love the style. The cotton is soft with some stretch. I would recommend going up a size if you are larger in the chest.


I read the reviews, so I made sure to order the Grace Karen dress and order up one size. It's exactly what I was expecting. The material is very nice. It's a cotton-blend dress with a sateen feel. It's a beautiful dress. It's perfect for a wedding I am attending.
