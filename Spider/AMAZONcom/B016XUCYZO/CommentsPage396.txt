I Love this Dress!!!! The fit was perfect I got so many compliments.


Very happy with this dress. I felt beautiful. Be mindful of the default sizing charts that Amazon uses though.


Love this dress the sizing chart is way off said I should get an 2xl when the lrg fit perfect I'm 185 and 5'9" I also purchased the white mesh skirt to make it puff out better


It is a nice dress, however the size runs a bit smaller than similar dresses the same size.  Satisfied with the way it fits.


Love the dress and the fit was perfect.  Changed up the belt to make it a little more fancy for my occasion.


This dress is everything Iâ€™d hoped it would be! The quality was amazing, I am going to continue buying these for a long time!

NEEDLESS TO SAY I GOT LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS!!!!

I love this dress it look just like the picture I order if in a 3x and the fit was great and got a purple petticoat to go under it


No cleaning instructions were on the dress, in the bag or available.  May I please have them?


Wearable, but a tad bit snug across back.  Is not flexible material.
