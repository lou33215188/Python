made for a doll


Gorgeous dress but very tight under the arms...


Super cute!


I love this dress! It fits great. I'm 5'4" and it comes to my knees. Super cute on and the fabric is wonderful. I did not wear the petticoat underneath.


My daughter is 4'11", 102 lbs, she wore the x-small. She felt comfortable with the length. This dress is great for the price. This dress gets wrinkled easily, but due to the patterns you can't tell.


Love this dress! I don't usually like purchasing clothes online because I am fairly short (5'1") and most dresses don't fit me well. This dress fit perfectly. I also love the fabric. Definitely purchasing another one!


Makes my waist look smaller. You must buy the skirt to wear underneath for proper look. Awesome ...


I expected a dress with no sleeves, but I could wear a bra. It came as a halter dress that ties behind the neck. I cannot wear this type of style because I have scars from breast cancer surgery so I sent it back.


I had to return my dress because at first it was too big for me,but my oh my! Once i got the other one i fell completely in love with it,great quality, fits perfectly and it is gorgeous and super comfortable, will be ordering more


I was very pleased with this purchase. It looks great, fits pretty well, and was absolutely worth the price! I bought this for a wedding reception I was attending, and I got compliments on it the whole night!
