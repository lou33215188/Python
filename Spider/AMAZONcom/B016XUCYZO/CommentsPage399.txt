So elegant.


The only complaint i have is that the dress is pictured with a belt and it did not come with a belt. Other than that it is a wonderful dress!


Beautiful dress.  Great material.  Great price for a very well made dress !!!


Great quality, arrived on time was worried it would be too small but ended up being slightly big. Overall love the way it looks on me.


Loved it, comfortable and fit perfectly.


Loved it. Glad I read the reviews and got a size larger. Good quality.


It's cute on. I would recommend that you buy a size larger than you think you need. Maybe two sizes if you're busty.


It's cute but fit way too large. The neck line is a bit droopy. It's cotton so I was able to shrink it a size and a half just by washing and drying it.


I got this dress for my daughter in an XS.  She is 5'1", and she weighs 85 lbs.  The bust was slightly big, but she is very small.  The dress is gorgeous and very elegant.


This dress is just as perfect as I imagined it would be!!! I am SO FREAKING EXCITED to wear it tomorrow night on my fancy date :)


The quality was what I expected, based on the great reviews. Quality is awesome. Material is NOT see thru... it's a heavier cotton with a little sheen to it. Fit was perfect!!!! I was concerned it would be too long, because I'm short, but I got a small; I'm 5'1", bust 33", waist 28", hips 38" and it's divine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It hits just below my knee. The waist and bust is perfect. It has a little bit of stretch.


I love love love this dress! I want to buy this in every single color and pattern.


I will wear it with a petticoat tomorrow night, but without it, it would be great as a casual work dress.


BUY THIS DRESS!!!! <3 <3 <3 You will not be disappointed.
