I haven't worn this yet, but it fits very well and is light enough for summer, but heavy enough that you can't see through it. The zipper is a bit of a challenge because it is one of those hidden zippers, but otherwise I love it and will order another one in a different color.


Bought 2 for my boyfriend daughter and she loves them,good quality too, better than I expected, she's wearing them for church


perfect for spring photos with family. I am a size 6/8 medium was a perfect fit.


I love this dress and the quality is great.


This dress is adorable! I received so many compliments! However be aware that it will shrink when you wash it. I followed the instructions however there was still shrinkage. Don't bother to get it hemmed, after washing it, it will be the length you want. Ha ha!


Beautiful summer dress....very pleased!!! Will be ordering all colors and print patterns. Great quality for the price. Haven't dry cleaned yet but so far so good!


It's perfect! I love it and like everyone else says, I need to buy one in every color.


I went with the dimensions posted but the dress is tight when being zipped up. It squished my bosom. Contemplating sending it back. It also pops out on my butt-area. I have a ample butt already so the extra pleats in the back make it extra poofy.


Cute!!!. I am 5'2", size 2 petite.  XS fit perfectly. Ordered another dress from this same company.  Both materials were cotton, but very satisfied with dresses & will definitely order again.


I wore this dress for my daughter's impromptu backyard wedding.  It was perfect & I absolutely love this dress!  The fabric is great & so is the fit.  I ordered a size up based on reviews and that was a good decision.  Planning to order another one in a different fabric.  What a GREAT dress.
