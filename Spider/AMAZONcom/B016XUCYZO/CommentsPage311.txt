My wife bought it and she looked stunning in it. It fit great.


I'm so pleased with this purchase, I plan on buying another one in a different color. I did switch the belt up. Perfect for a tea date.


I didn't love how this dress looked on me. Felt the polka dots made me look bigger. I also wanted a dress that was a little longer. I am normally a size 12 and ordered a large which seemed right. However, I just didn't fall in love w the dress. Returned.


Durable fabric, made very well!  Im in love with it, bought the retro dress slip to wear under it and its all perfect.


Freaking love this dress. I'm a size 2 and xs fit perfect. Wore to a good friends wedding. Loved it so much just bought in another color.


great fit and flattering, but the fabric wrinkles so easily, it wasn't worth keeping.


Excellent quality and fit


This dress is perfect! The only reason I say it's too large is because I have a smaller chest than most in my 18/20 size so it's a little big there,  but everywhere else is flawless. The perfect dress!


If you fluctuate between sizes like I do and fantasize about where you would like to be, you'll disappoint yourself...hahaha. I would definitely go with the bigger size. The dress fits well.


Absolutely gorgeous. We will be celebrating my mom 80th birthday and the committee will all wear this beautiful dress. Dress vcery well made and the packaging is very nice also.
