This product fits very nicely. The material is thin.


I order a small and it fit me just like it should. The material is great! It is also very smooth. I am very happy with this purchase


Exactly what I was looking for! I love vintage dresses and this is perfect! I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly!


Waist is rather high, more like an empire waist than I expected.  Otherwise this is a lovely dress.  The fabric is sturdy but still soft.


I received so many compliments on this dress.  I am hoping to buy it in more colors as needed.


Love this dress. Itâ€™s so comfy! It was perfect for the tea party I attended!


My daughter loves it.


Perfect little black dress!


Loved the dress except a little too snug in the waist for its size also not enough holes in belt


It was what I was hoping for as far as the material butt it was to big. I am actually altering myself.
