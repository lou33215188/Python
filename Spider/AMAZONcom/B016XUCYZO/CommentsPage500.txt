I got what I paid for. Material is transparent which I don't like but will work well when putting something underneath. Fit below the knees. I am 5'6"


The dress fits as the correct size but the torso is very sshort in the torso and it did not come with at  belt. Beereee


Love this dress. It's so flattering and modest.


Perfect fit.


Super cute!  It's a little bit full in the skirt for me...but it is really cute, made well and fits me well!
