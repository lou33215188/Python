Ok I'll start this by saying I'm 5 foot 3 inches with a 38DD chest so i got 2XL. It fit like a dream, no tailoring required. It was elegant and pretty and just the perfect dress. I got it in black and just couldn't be happier.


Beautiful dress... very well made & fits perfectly!


This dress was so cute! I bought it for my high school daughter for a 50's choir show. She had the cutest outfit on stage! The material was nice, and it fit perfectly. To look like a swing dress, you do need a crinoline slip underneath. Without the added slip, she could wear this dress for several occasions.


Cute.  Felt nice on. Slimming.  I didn't even need to wear the belt.  However, what I didn't notice until I put it on to leave for a wedding - was that the the hem was uneven.  It would be hard to fix, but I'm hoping nobody notices.


I love the print . However cut is too small at the waist for me.


Absolutely love it. Very good quality and fits perfectly. I am a size 20W and it fit perfectly. Bought this for my sister's wedding this May.


Adorable and fits perfectly.


I'll be buying more in different fabrics.


This dress is so worth it! Nice thick quality material and a great length too! Definitely will order again in other colors.


This dress fits perfectly.... measurements are perfect. I LOVE THIS AND WILL BE ORDERING OTHERS.


If I could give it no stars I would.... I got a knock off from GK Queen-  it was supposed be boat neck and came as a V-neck and had like a satin sash around the waist
