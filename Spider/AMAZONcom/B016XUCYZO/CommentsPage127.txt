Make sure you're really careful with what size you get.  This fits slightly large and it doesn't shrink.


Beautiful dress. Looks just like picture. My buyer really loved it.


The dress is a good dress....but the length stinks. I wanted it below my knee. I'm 5' 7 and I read a answer that said they were too and it went "well below" the knee.....mmmmm.....nope. Far from it. If you'reâ€‹ tall and want the dress below the knee, look elsewhere. This is for shorter people. The rest of the dress was super cute and fashionable though. ğŸ˜Š


Love this dress! Fit perfectly and very tastefully. Received many compliments. I am 5'6", 150 pounds and a medium fit great!


This dress is very nice and good quality. I purchased floral-22 and received complements from almost everyone I saw (no petticoat required). I am 5'4 and 150lbs and the large fit perfectly. The fabric is kind of stiff and holds in wrinkles. Do not order if you don't like to iron.


Thrilled to find this dress!


(For those that may be confused, this is my husband's account)


I debated on getting this dress b/c even though the reviews were good, I didn't know what to expect for a plus-size.  For the record, I wear an 18/20 and am 5'2.  I bought a 2X going by the measurement guide and the dress fits perfectly.  Often, I have fit issues through the bust area as I wear a 44DDD, but there were no issues with this dress.  If you're considering buying one, I happily recommend it!


Cheap material, oily smell, pinches at bustline and irregular and droopy hemline in back. Does not flatter the figure at all. I would never again even look at a dress in this style.


Such a cute dress. It looks great on and when I wear it I get many compliments


I LOVE this dress. The color is AMAZING. I ordered an 4XL. I notmally wear a 3XL and it fits somewhat big so I have to wear it with a sweater because the arms are huge with this size. I think I'll order a 3XL next time.


I love this dress!  It was comfortable and SO VERY CUTE!  The material has a little stretch to it making this the perfect little dress.
