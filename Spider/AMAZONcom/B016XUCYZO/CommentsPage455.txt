I bought this dress for a summer wedding and its perfect.


Good quality and good fit. Will order more dresses from this designer in the future.


The dress is beautiful and fit perfectly. It matches the online description exactly.


I received so many compliments on this dress! Glad I bought it and it fit perfectly!


The dress I received did not look like this floral print and came with no paperwork!


I absolutely love this dress. It's cute and comfortable.


The dress is great and fun to wear.  The only negative was that I did not receive the belt that was advertised as coming with the dress.


This dress is really pretty. Fit just perfect!!! Got it a size bigger and was perfect. I ordered another dress right away for my bday


This is a very classy dress. Can be dressed up or down. Fabric is fabulous. Great quality feel to it.


Super cute, especially with the petticoat.
