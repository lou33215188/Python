Liked it but too small


Very pretty dress, not cheap material.  I am a size 0-2, 5/1" and it fit everywhere.  It went a little passed my knees (nothing crazy) so I am having it hemmed to right at my knees just because I prefer that style on me.


Love it , it is beautiful and fits as chart describes. :) Happy


What a lovely, lovely dress! I bought 2 for my twin girls, x-small. Fit perfectly. I would definitely purchase a dress from this vendor again.


Good quality. I wear a 12-14, 36D, I'm 5'6". An XL fits but it's tight.


Too small and too busy for me. It goes back.


Loved the dress got lots of head turns and compliments. Only thing I wasn't happy with was the size. The dress fit too big on top...After reading tons of reviews I went with the XL but could have went with a L. Follow the sizing chart this dress is true to size.


This is a great dress!


I love this dress! It fit perfectly for the size I ordered. I was somewhat leery when ordering this, hoping that it would fit okay. It has exceeded my expectations. If I could buy this dress in every color available I would. I also bought the petticoat to go underneath and I'm glad I did so it poofed out more.


It's beautiful on  .. material feels sturdy...dress well made...  XXL SIZED 16
