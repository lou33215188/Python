muy bien


I literally got a compliment from every single person I saw the day I wore this dress.  I paired it with the skinny black belt and mary jane shoes.  Comfy too.  I love it!


Not my size


It was a little small but I anticipated that and ordered a size larger than usual. Good material and workmanship! I would purchase again.


I got this dress to wear for my costume this Halloween. When it arrived first off i was very surprised at how good the quality of the dress was. It was a good material. It also fit perfectly! I will wear this dress again not as a costume! I will also order it again in other colors/patterns


Very nice dress - fit as expected. I bought a small - for reference I am 5'7, 132lbs and have a 27 inch waist.


Love this dress


The dress is a little big. But nothing a seamstress can't fix. Will be buying more. So happy.


This dress is dressier than I expected but it fits gorgeous. It is a little too fancy for daily wear, so now I need an occasion to wear it


Great dress!!! Very flattering fit. I wore this dress with a petticoat for fullness. I received TONS of compliments in this dress on Easter.
