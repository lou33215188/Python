Did not come with belt like it said it would. Dress is cute but very frustrated it falsely advertised that it included the belt in the photo


The size large is too big but the dress is beautiful....


The description says it is 96% cotton, but it is clearly mostly synthetic. Fits small. Looks nice, though


Love this dress, fit perfectly! From the other reviews I did take one size up and happy I did. This is one of my favorite dresses now.


I LOVE HOW THIS DRESS FITS!! IT'S LIGHT, MATERIAL IS VERY COMFORTABLE!!


Dress fit great! I'm 5'3" 155 lbs and large fit perfect. The petticoat completes the look. The material is soft. Great dress. Great fit


Love this dress! It a flattering fit and I always get compliments on it when I wear it!


Beautiful dress!


I love the dress but i ordered the wrong size. I will order this one next time and I hope  I will order the right size for me.


Great dress for my Kentucky Derby party
