After reading the reviews, I ordered a size larger than what I usually wear and it fit perfectly. Wore it with a petticoat and it gives that vintage look.  Got lots of compliments. Planning to order couple more in different colors.


cheap looking and mine arrived without the black belt


Bought this dress for my daughter for her 6th grade winter dance. It fits perfect to sizing chart. The colors are rich, the fabric is perfectly weighted. Loved it so much I bought one for me.


I was so excited for this dress and taking the reviews into account ordered a size larger than I typically wear. It still didn't fit.


I love this!!


Beautiful dress! The fabric is very good quality. The dress is gorgeous. Absolutely love it!


i love the dress but i buy size L;  becouse a read others costumers ; they have to buy one size more, and is to big  me


I am a medium size.


Fits perfectly. I used the measurement chart and it helped. I am 5'2 and 130lbs I bought a Large.


It looks fantastic but if you’re a heavier chest female I’d recommend upsizing.


Beautiful dress and material. My daughter loves it
