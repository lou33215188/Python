Love love love this dress but didn't come with the belt as advertised. I'm 5'3" and 135 lbs, usually a size 4 in dresses, ordered the small, fit perfectly! I love it both with and without my petticoat. Great buy!


This was a gift for my very finiky teen age daughter. It fit her perfectly and she loved it! Beautiful quality!! Thank you!


Love this dress.  I got a ton of compliments when I wore it. I am 5'3", 34d and a medium fit perfectly!


only complaint was it's too short. I'm 5'10" and it shows my knees and part of my thighs. Too short for a swing dress. Sending it back


Beautiful and such great quality at a great price!


The stitching of the dress is uneven. The right side of the dress is short and the left side is long.  I was disappointed.


A Nice dress. Would have loved if my upper torso fitted a bit better. Not a bad spend at all.


Love the style and fit of the dress.


Loved it, just ordered a size to big


Love this dress .it looks so beautiful
