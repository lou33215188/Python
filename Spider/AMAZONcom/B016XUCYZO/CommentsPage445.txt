I was excited to get this dress, and I wasn't disappointed. I got multiple compliments. I can't wait to buy another dress!


This dress fit perfect and the colors are beautiful


Beautiful material. And fits


Fit was perfect. I normally wear a 14 and I orders the XL.  There is no lining and the white is sheer. Over all for the price it was a good buy.


This dress is beautiful! The fabric is a great quality and the cut and composition are amazing! This is a true twirly dress.


Runs small! My daughter usually wears a small, but we had to go up to a Medium to get this dress to fit correctly.


Looks awesome on


Dress fit true to size. I ordered a small. Very cute dress.  Added a petty coat to make the skirt puff out more.


Great quality


Loved this dres!!! I ordered it a bit bigger and it is true to size
