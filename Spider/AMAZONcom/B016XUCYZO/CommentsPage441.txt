Absolutely in love with this dress. Wore it for my Master's graduation and got tons of compliments on it. I did add the petticoat, which made it flare beautifully!


This is my favorite dress and I have many! It's true to size and it is great quality. It's not that ugly stretchy fabric it's a very comfortable cotton mix but it's worth it!
