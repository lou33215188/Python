This came nicely packaged and fit me perfectly. I am so surprised that it fit as well as it did since you never know when ordering. I am wearing for a wedding in Connecticut in So excited!.


The top of the dress is too large but I am going to take it in at the sides under the armpit.

Great fit. Beautiful design. I get so many compliments on the dress! Belt is a nice addition but kept falling out of the loop(only downfall).
