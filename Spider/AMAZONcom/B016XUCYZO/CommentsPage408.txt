Haven't worn mine yet but it fits me very nicely. The quality superseded my expectations.


Luckily it fit since I would not have had time to return before my trip. Material is flimsy but it worked for what i needed it for.


I like the material and it fits perfectly. Hopefully I am looking forward to have an other type with two pcs. ( like dress and jacket )


Flattering for full figure, without making you look too stuffy.


Love this dress. Exactly as shown in the picture. The fabric is great. Looks classy.


Love the dress itself - just too large. Sent back for a smaller size. I was between sizes and opted for the larger of the two - should have chosen the smaller one.


Love love love this dress! Super cute style and perfect for any occasion! I am 5'7" 125 lbs and got an XS. It fits perfectly, but for anyone larger in the bust (I am a 34A-B) the underarms might be too tight. Love this dress and would definitely recommend it!


Fits exactly as expected, very comfy, sturdy fabric. Waist line is just above my true waist.


Beautiful fit, very flattering!


Sized on the small size.  Love the dress-got many compliments!
