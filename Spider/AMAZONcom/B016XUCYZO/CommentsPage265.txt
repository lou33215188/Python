The dress is as pictured. I bought one size up because of past experiences with items being too small but this one was the right size.


I am 5'.4" and the dress hits just below the knees.


The material is really nice, feels like cotton.


Can't wait to wear it.


Too small


Lovely pattern and fits well. 5'2 about 180 lbs size close worked well for me :). Now have the dress in 2 different colors. The belt is not great prefer one a little wider.


FIt perfectly.  Ordered a large.  5' 6" 145 pounds.  Great fit.


Fitted as expected on my gf. She was very pleased. Very bright and rich colours. Excellent material


For the price, this is a really cute dress. It is not lined; however, no big deal. Fits really small to size. I bought it several sizes too large in order to custom tailor the fit. However, it fit perfectly. Very full skirt and color is true to the photo.


This dress was a wonderful purchase for my daughter's semi-formal school dance. While all the other girls wore traditional pink, soft blue, etc dresses, this dress was an eye catcher and a HUGE hit!  So glad we bought it -- and the price was AmAzinG!!!


Cute but Fabric has odor


I love this dress! It fits perfectly! The belt is a little big but that is an easy fix. The material is sturdy and it is absolutely comfortable. I couldn't be happier! I would recommend it with red shoes :) I just bought the Black with white polka dots Yesterday and cannot wait for it to arrive! I am wearing it for my rockabilly bridal shower AND rehearsal Dinner!


This is one of the prettiest dresses I have. I love the fit and its so flattering for a pear shape. I received a ton of compliments the day I wore this dress to a ladies luncheon.
