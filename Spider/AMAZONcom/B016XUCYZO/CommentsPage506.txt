I  BOUGHT THIS DRESS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO WEAR TO HER UNCLE'S WEDDING. The dress fit perfectly and was just beautiful on her.  It was a hit.


It fits like one size bigger, but material is nice and with petticoat looks incredible.


Fits nicely


Nicely made but runs very small


Not really for a lady with big breast


liked it all


Well made with great fabric. No stretch. A little tight through the chest. So choose size accordingly.


Looks and feels cheap, I ordered the black one and I don't like the material.


I love it! Lightweight fabric & it even come with a cute belt. Definelty a deal!


Beautiful dress.
