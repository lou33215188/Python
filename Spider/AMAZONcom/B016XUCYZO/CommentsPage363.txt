I love this dress and will be ordering more like it!


Super cute, fits like a 2X should. I'm 5'9" and the dress comes to my knees. The belt was a little small, I had to add a couple of holes, but overall a great, fun, dress!


I had to send the first one back. Ordered the xl after reading other reviews. Return was easy. Got the large in and got great in the waist the bust I'd a bit big but it still looked good.


Way smaller than stated! Then told I couldn't return it :(


SOOOOO adorable.  Great fit, comfortable material.  I received a TON of compliments.  Ordered an XL (I'm a size 14) and it fit great.  But DEFINITELY order the crinoline (rockabilly tutu skirt) to go with it.  Otherwise, it just sort of hangs there.


Love it. Nice fit and comfortable.


I really like it! Perfect length. A little small in bust area. If debating between a medium or large â€“ I would go large.


I love the fit and the quality of the fabric. It's the prettiest dress I've ever owned and I feel beautiful in it


The shape is nice but the fabric was not at all ehat I expected. It's shinny and feels cheap. I'm sending the dress back.


It's kind of my fault, I don't know what else I was expecting for that price.


Returning it but only because the waist was too high on me. It is pretty and was true to size.
