I ordered a large. I'm 5'3 and weight 145 pounds and the dress fit too big from the bust and the waist. I proceeded to return the dress and re-order a medium and the dress fit perfectly. It look extremely elegant with a petticoat underneath..


Fine.


This dress is well made, good fabric, it is absolutely stunning!  Fits great in my regular size...love, love, love it!


Beautiful dress, but I could not zip it up


Wore at graduation, with my black cap and gown, it was a bit of "when life gives you lemons" overall the dress was well made but fit a little small.


It totally goes with my 1950s wardrobe.


This dress is super cute!  I already bought a 2nd one and may be going back for a third.  The stretchy fabric is forgiving and the fit is flattering, even on larger women.


Loved this dress!!! I used the size chart, and it was too large in the chest. Next time, I will size down b/c the hips are very forgiving.


Nice!!


Gorgeous  my daughter loves it!
