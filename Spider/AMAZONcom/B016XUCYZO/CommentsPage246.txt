Great dress, very beautiful. Unfortunately I have since returned it because the bust was too small. I ordered an XL and had plenty of room in the waist but my bust was "busting" out of this dress! I'm a larger woman; I wear U.S. size 18 jeans and a 38DD bra size so I thought I would definitely have enough room up top but, alas, did not.


Gorgeous dress. Very happy with it and love the way it fits.


Awesome dress! So glad it fits well!


The texture of this dress is very soft cotton. At first look it felt as if the waist was too small but when you wear it, the waist line is almost empire like. It is at low chest/ high waist. So it doesnt show muffin tops. Love the dress and design. Length is just at knees. So very comfortable


Cute, but short waisted


This dress is absolutely gorgeous! It's cotton, but it's a quality cotton. I'm amazed that this dress is only $29.99. I feel beautiful and elegant in it. Being plus-size, it's hard to find dresses that make me feel as good as this one does.


Love this dress! I'm 5'7" 158lbs and a 36DD and I bought a large and it fits beautifully. Vibrant colors with a charming belt accent. Please measure yourself and use their guidelines. Looks great with or without a petticoat.


I love the dress. I got so many compliments. I will be buying more. The fabric is great. Purchased from GK Queen.


Size down.


Pretty dress but not even close in sizing.  Normally wear a 1X and I read it ran small so I ordered a 3X.  It fit like I had ordered an L/XL.  Very disappointing.
