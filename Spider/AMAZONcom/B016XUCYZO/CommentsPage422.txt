Love this dress! Beautiful print. Good quality well made. Great price. Thanks for all the reviews they helped alot.


Great summer dress and it easily transitions from casual to dressy.


Absolutely love this dress! Fit perfectly and got tons of compliments when I wore it for Easter!


Nice dress, but feels like I am wearing a sheet... not very comfortable.


I love this dress!  I got it to wear to a Kentucky Derby party with a black and white hat.  It is amazing how perfectly it fits.  I love it and will wear it many times in the future!


I really like this dress and look forward to wearing it.  It's kind of cheaply constructed,  but for $30, it was more than I expected.


Ya it's good but it's looking puffy


Love the dress but I am not this size.


The fit was PERFECT. I love these dresses. They are the right outfit for every occasion.


Very disappointed by this dress.  The measurements aren't even close to the actual sizing.
