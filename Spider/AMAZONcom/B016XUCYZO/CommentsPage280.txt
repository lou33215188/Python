Super cute dress. It's shorter than I expected as it appears to fall mid calf for other buyers, but came right to my knees. It's cute...I will keep it.


I ordered this dress size based on the measurements shown in the size chart, and it's a perfect fit. I'm excited to wear it to my friend's wedding next month.


The dress is nice quality and super cute.  It was a little roomier than I anticipated, but not enough to need to exchange it.


The hem line was a little uneven so I decided to send it back and reorder.  When I contacted amazon about reordering without shipping costs because of a defect in the dress, they took care of it swiftly, amazing.  I love the dress, I did purchase the petticoat as well.


I ordered the size recommended based on the size scale included with the pictures. It fits very well and I am very happy!


Purchased this dress for my daughters role in Hairspray. Very cute and she now looks the part! Would have given it 5 stars but the belt didn't come with it like stated in the description.


Loved this dress and this style so perfect!


I ordered an xl because most things I order off amazon run small, but it's a bit loose. Nice quality for the price and the fabric seems ok. We shall see the quality of the stitching with wear.


I wear size 6/8 and it fits perfect!!


Beautiful. Fit perfectly.  Very comfortable.  The belt was a nice touch.
