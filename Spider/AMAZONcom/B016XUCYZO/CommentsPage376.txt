Very nice dress. Wrinkles easy. I'm smaller on top than bottom so I got a 1x and fit great. Fun with a petticoat.


Ended up returning the product. The waist was way too high and made me look boxy and short. Also the material looked cheap.


I'm so impressed with the dress. It fits perfectly but I'm reluctant to dry clean just in case there is any shrinkage.


Bought it for wifey dear. She loves it. She would have liked it 2-4 inches longer (but then she is tall.. 5'9").. Good quality fabric, belt nothing to write home about.


The dress is amazing.  I love the material,  I ordered a bigger size thinking it ran small.  Other than that I am happy with my purchase.


Bought for my daughter and she loves it.


Beautiful design, well made.  Very classy, fits well.


The dress was a complete hit and adorned and loved by many. The fit was perfect and I want them in all colors


Absolutely love it!! Perfect fit!!


I'm 5'7" waist was a bit high and the dress was shorter than expected for my height. Otherwise I like the way it fits, good material.
