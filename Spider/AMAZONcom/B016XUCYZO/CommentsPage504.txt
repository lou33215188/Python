Bought this dress for my daughter, fits great! Excellent quality, couldn't believe the price and she absolutely loves it. Will be buying again in another color.


I was so excited to get this dress.  The style is adorable on and the fit is very flattering!


LOVE THIS DRESS!!! Bought a size up so I could have wiggle room. Very flattering.


Sizing not accurate, unable to return  due to shipped being in China


Fits great! I am 5'0 and ordered a small. It is a little long but that's expected with my height.


The shoulder is thinner than the picture looks, so it is more like a tank top rather than covering the top of the shoulder but otherwise great dress.


I'm kind of a little thin & I did expect the dress to fit somewhat loose but it wasn't as bad... It fit nicely.


All my friends liked the dress. I got the red dress with black polka dots...


I get so many compliments on this dress! It's perfect! It fits my curve figure great!


Fits perfectly! I'm 5.8" and it has a good length a little above the knees. The color is beautiful. I got a lot of complements. Definitely good dress for the price.


Beautiful and fit perfectly
