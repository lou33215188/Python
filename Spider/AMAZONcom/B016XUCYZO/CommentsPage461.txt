I love this dress! It does fit a tad loosely around the bust, I ordered a small and where a 32C. But otherwise it is great! I ordered a white petticoat and received numerous compliments!


Fit as expected.  I loved everything about it.  Looked exactly as expected.


Dress fits perfectly. For those who say the dresses run small, maybe you need to be realistic about what size you really wear. Perfect fit and beautiful!


Beautiful pattern, fits perfectly, and I feel fabulous every time I put it on.


Only complaint i have is that my dress did not come with the black belt shown.


This vendor is so on point, I'm a quality gal and I have ordered 3 different dresses so far and I am about to order 2 more. I can't say enough. Love it!


Finally found cotton. Not 100% but feels like cotton not like spandex, the fit true to size. Belt is a little 'cheezy' but I had one.


Absolutely phenomenal! What a great fit and it hugs in all the right places! Great purchase!


Beautiful dress and great fit material and design is high quality for the price.


Material stitches  poor quality
