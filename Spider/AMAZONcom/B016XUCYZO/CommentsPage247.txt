I love this dress!  I got the light blue dress with the polka dots.  Fits well, super soft material and looks great with or without petticoat.  I'm ordering another in a different color after I have finished done writing this review.  I am a size 18w and wear a 38 DDD bra, I ordered a 2X and it is a little big in the chest


Seriously - for the price this is the BEST dress I have ever bought. It is so flattering and so versatile. We will see if it holds up but I am so glad I purchased it!


Returned, didn't fit.


I love my 1950s dress, thanks. Cute with red pumps.


Very comfortable and looks like you came straight out of Breakfast at Tiffany's


Beautiful!!! Nice fabric, great style! My daughter is about 5'6" and 115 pounds. Fit her perfect, great length and fit under her arms. Ordered the size 2. Will definitely order again!!


The materiel is amazing. It has great stitching and the pattern is gorgeous. However, it is a bit large on me, but instead of returning it I got it tailored because I couldn't wait that long to wear it. Amazing dress.


Love this fit, love this style, love this dress.


Beautiful dress but had to return as the XS was not small enough.  Would love if they offered a xxs... had to return and buy a girls large... haven't gotten it yet, so hope it fits.


I absolutely LOVE this dress! Itâ€™s super cute, and very modest, which I love! Definitely going to be buying different ones!
