Husband really liked it, great price, pretty color.


I'm look sexy on this dress.


Love it! Nice quality, nice fit!!


I was a little skeptical, but the material and fit are great. Good dress, if you want you just need to buy a petticoat to wear underneath to make it fuller. Follow the size chart.


Nice dress but a bit short .


IT IS BEAUTIFUL BUT MUCH SMALLER THAN ANTICIPATED. IT IS PERFECT IF YOU ARE FLAT CHESTED BUT THE BODICE IS SO SMALL IT FIT MY 9 YEAR OLD NIECE!


Beautiful dress :)


It fits a little big in the shoulders, but I usually wear petites so I guess that is to be expected!


Good quality, no odd smell from the fabric or dyes, fit well,  I will order more form this maker!


The size is too small, should add at least 4 inches to my real size when choosing the right size.
