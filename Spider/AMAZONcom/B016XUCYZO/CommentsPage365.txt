I am in LOVE with this dress!! It fits exactly as described in the listing. Superior quality and design... I am getting this in a number of colors!


I have a few of these dresses and they fit perfect. Unfortunately the last two I ordered were shorter so I sent them back.


The quality is great, and it is a beautiful dress. I have a shorter upper body, and the neckline came up to my neck where it rubbed. I do not like clothing that is that close to my neck (I do not wear turtlenecks and such).


I bought this dress to wear on Valentines Day for a Vow Renewal. Paired with a petticoat and a red belt it was the hit of the day. Many compliments.


Beautiful dress and great quality!


Bought for a wedding - Kentucky derby themed wedding -  received numerous compliments on it - would not hesitate to purchase again in several colors!!  Go for it - you will not be upset!


Great quality. I bought this for my daughter and she couldn't be more pleased


Fit perfectly, looks really good


The black and white polkadot dress was exactly what I wanted! I love it!


Loved this dress! While it didn't fix exactly how I hoped it still fits and I can't wait to wear it and will most likely be ordering more! Great packaging as well!
