Got a different dress than I ordered. I like the dress but it is a different cut with a sweetheart neckline and no belt.


I ordered a size larger than a usually go with. When it arrived it looked about 8 sizes too small. Plus I can't get a refund due to the fact I would have to ship it back to China. Don't waste your money.


Overall pleased with the item received.  Shipping was as expected.  I am 5'9", 36B, 200 lbs - arm holes were a bit 'high' so I'm tailoring them to be a little lower/wider.


I didnâ€™t like that the blue on the dress was a totally different color than in the picture, however it is still a beautiful dress.


It also a little snuggle at the bust still love it


It was great. It was a Christmas gift to my sister and she was so happy . Perfect fot


My daughter loves this dress and it is exactly what we expected it to be.


Runs very small.  Not for tall women with low waist. The waist was almost under breast.


Great dress. Fits well.


Stunning lady bug dress.  I really love this dress and have it in other patterns and colors.
