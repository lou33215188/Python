Description no here near the actual product!!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!!!


I can't wait to get more of these dresses in many different colors and patterns!! Wonderful dress could not be happier with it!!!


It's cute...I ordered larger size - still tight around the chest and waist....


I love my dress. Not too long but not too short. Just the perfect fit


This dress would be so cute for someone who is a size 5 or smaller. I am a size 10 and the way the skirt flares, it makes me look MUCH bigger. Otherwise it is beautiful...just not for me.


Fits perfectly and look amazing!


Received on time. It was a little big... but that was my fault. I am trying a new size.


I bought this dress for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! She looks great in it!


waste is very high, not like in Audrey Hepburn's original dress. It makes you look fat.


It's very cute! I like the fit, length, and everything. I got the crinoline to go under it, but honestly it looks good with or without it!
