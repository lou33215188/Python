Cute dress, fit snug, however...received the dress with a stain on it.


I loved this design, fabric seems better suited for a cheap apron than a dress.  Maybe I missed a detail, was this intended to be a costume?


Absolutely adorable dress. Very happy with it. Size and material are perfect.


Good quality material....fits and look good


Love this dress


An okay dress with a completely ridiculous belt.  I have a 28" waist (but a 36" bust) so I ordered the medium, which fits well.  The M says it fits a 30" waist.  The SMALLEST hole on the belt they sent was 36"!  There is NO WAY that is going to fit anyone who fits into that dress.  Also the belt is very cheaply made; it's that fake velvet on plastic, like those poppy pins you get on rememberence / veterans day.  But you have to have a belt to get the right look with this dress style.  If you are going to spend another $5-10 on a belt, you might as well get a better dress in the first place.


Next issue is the waistline.  I have an hourglass figure and I'm slim.  EVERYTHING looks good on me -- except this dress.  It hits 2" above the natural waistline which has the effect of turning you into a rectangle.  It looked "okay" but not "wow" like the picture, and certainly not figure-flattering.  For this kind of style the belt really needs to hit at your natural waistline like the picture implies.  Maybe if you are petite it would fit decently.


I absolutely love this dress. I fee like the fit is true to size.  It was perfect for my brunch event, it arrived on time and was packaged really cutely.

The dress fits perfectly and I love the material! Would definitely buy again. It looks great with or without a petticoat.


It was so beautiful! All people had just compliments to my outfit. I was so happy and felt so pretty!
