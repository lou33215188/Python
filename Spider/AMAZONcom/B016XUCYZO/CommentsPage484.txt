Really great product, just too large. I reordered it in a smaller size


Fits great..but the belt it comes with didn't have the piece that holds the belt flat..so I had to make shift


I like this dress it was just fitted in the breast area. A bit snug


Love it. Will wear it for the summertime.


I am obsessed with this dress! I bought it to wear to a wedding and it fit perfectly! I am 5'8" 200 pounds and a 36B bra size and I ordered the XL. I got so many compliments on this dress...everyone loved it! The material is like a thick silky type material which adds an extra touch to the dress!  I will be buying more in different colors.


I love this dress a little bit short ,I like the fabric and the colors.


Too small in size despite the measurements they provided.


Lovely dress


CUTE CUTE CUTE! NICE QUALITY....CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR IT!!!


Perfect fitting
