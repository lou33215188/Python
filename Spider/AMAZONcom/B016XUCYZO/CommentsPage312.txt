I am very happy with this dress. I got a 1x and it ran true to size. I got the black and white floral which was really pretty for an evening out.


Great


My wife bought it but I like it so much I DID THE REVIEW!!


Very pretty. Looks great on


According to bust measurement  and waist  this runs huge .  Will be returning.  The quality is nice though


I'm returning and reordering this


Bought a Size L for my 5' 6" frame.  Perfect for our '50s themed party.  Looks great with a petticoat which doesn't come with the dress.


It's the third time I ordered this dress. It fits as expected and it's comfortable. The material quality is very good and the proce is reasonable. It is a really cute dress.


I love this dress


The dress is really well made and a thick material (so you can't see through).  It is VERY fitted though, so make sure you really do the measurements and pick your size according to that.
