I purchased 7 of these for my wife.  Fit was as expected and they look fantastic on her!


Measured right in between a small and medium and after reading reviews decided to go with the small. It fit perfectly.


This is my favorite dress.


Perfect for my 40th Birthday party! Needs a petticoat if you want it puffy!


This dress is beautiful, the material is so comfy and flexible! I wore it for my daughter's commissioning to the US Navy at the Officer's Club! I got lots of compliments. Thank you!


Beautiful dress. Perfect for the occasion...


Love this dress, I feel like a celebrity in it! I added the crinoline and it's the perfect dress for a party, horse racing event, wedding guest or just in general!


Returning for a smaller size. I went by the size chart but should have known better. Can't wait to get the right size back!


Love the dress! Great material! The only problem I had was it being a size too big. I assumed from reading the reviews that it would be smaller but it wasnt.


This dress fit my daughter perfectly!  Very flattering!  The only issue is that the belt was way too long!  We just cut it to make it shorter.  There is also no care tag.
