Loved it!!


The dress was for my daughter and it fits her perfectly.  It's well made and the fabric has some give that stretches for comfort.


Wasn't flattering on my hourglass shape. I sent it back.


I loved the dress, but doesn't work well with women with very large breasts and small waist.


Since I am only 4'11 I had to trim off 2 inches and re-did the hem. The bodice fit just right. I weigh 114 lbs.


Beautiful dress however when ordering order a size up


Even the size was bigger than what i am, ITS STILL TOO LARGE


Great product


Perfect!!!!!


Poor quality product
