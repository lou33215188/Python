Dress fits wonderfully. Exactly what i expected, I'm not to fond of the belt pretty flimsy but overall great.


So cute!!!!


Great dress!  Lovely fit!


This dress is horrible! fabric is cheap and paper thin!


My wife gets complimented wearing this one


perfect fit, and it is beautiful


Gave it as a gift -- the dress itself, fit perfectly, was well made.  The belt however, was way too long and not useable.


Great dress for the price.


Amaxing dress, perfect fit!
