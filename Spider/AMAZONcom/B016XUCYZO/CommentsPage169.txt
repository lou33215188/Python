It will come sort of wrinkly but that's okay. Very smooth and elegant looking. The belt was way too big so I had to poke another hole in it. It would be more poofy if I had one of those poofy underskirts, but I don't, so it hung flat.


Love the dress. Will probably buy more in different colors.


I am pear shaped and range between a 6-8 in dresses and I bought a medium.


Beautiful on my daughter. This is a 50s dress. We both love it.


Daughter using in school play Hair spray she State works great!


Super cute! Fits perfectly and I get soo many compliments. Buy!


I always get compliments on this dress, from strangers on the street to coworkers and friends. It's a great dress for the money, universally flattering and well sewn. Pockets would be nice, but it's super cheap that I wouldn't expect it included.


Love this dress! The fit is great and it looks fantastic with a black rockabilly skirt underneath.  The material and the construction/seams are good, it has washed well, and I have gotten a lot of compliments and "where did you find that?!" I'm going to order the black one with hot pink polkadots next.


If you don't own this yet you're missing out!! Gorgeous dress, so well made, fits like a DREAM! Easy dress to wear for work and with an added crinoline it's absolutely adorable. I want every color and pattern! You'll feel like a princess in this dress and what girl down't love that?


The dress is made beautifully with good quality material.  It fits perfectly plus it's such a cute classic dress.  I'll most likely will buy a couple more dresses with different designs.


This is such a beautiful dress. Very nice quality. Wore it to work and received compliments all day!  I've purchased 3 dresses in different colors. Grace Karin has beautiful, high quality,  afforadable clothing.
