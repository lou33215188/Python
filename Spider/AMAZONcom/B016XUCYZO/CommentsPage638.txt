the size was off!!!!! I gave this dress to my sister as a gift instead of me keeping it for myself. The size I wear is large or maybe x large not a 2 x large or higher . the reason I gave this dress two star is because the look and the feel of this dress. other then that a flat O


Perf!!


OMG!!! In what universe is this the correct sizing? I LOVE this dress...IF I could get it on. I am SO disappointed as I got the petticoat and fascinator hat to match it...for our Kentucky Derby themed gala in April. The sizing is not even a bit close! I wear a 12-14, am 5'9" and XL should have been fine. So very bummed.
