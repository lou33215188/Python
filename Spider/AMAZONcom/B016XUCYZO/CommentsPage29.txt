I love this dress, it might be the perfect dress ever.


I buy all my dresses from Amazon, typically the ones like this that all come from China. I'm 5'7, 250 pounds, waist is 43, hips are 50. I typically take a 3x in these dresses.


The 3x was surprisingly big, and the 2X is perfect. Even has some wiggle room still.


I also have a short torso, which often causes dresses to bunch and fit a bit odd, but this one is so perfect. I love it.


The material is nice and thick, it feels very well made. Although I usually pay around $20 or less for these dresses, this one is a cut above and worth the higher price.


I'll probably buy more.


poor quality, runs large, and it's very wrinkled. I ordered a medium because that is what I normally wear. I'm 5'5" and 143 lbs. I'm a 34C with a curvy waist and large bum. It was way too large everywhere. This fit like an XL


Bought this dress for a dear friend's day time wedding. It had a 50's garden theme. I was also asked to wear black. It was perfect! I got SO many compliments on it. It fit  perfect. Also it hid my tummy ğŸ˜‰  An amazing find for a great price.


I absolutely adore this dress. It fits wellâ€” material is not itchy. The cut is very flattering. I have the black one as well ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜� the only thing wrong with that order is I did not receive the belt.  Quick fix.


These are perfect for weddings, dinner, funerals etc


Can't beat the style, especially for the price! It's a great design, simple and elegant and very flattering.


Regarding the fit, I think it's great for most people. I'm tall and skinny with a low waist, so the waistline on this dress (size Small) is just a little high for my liking. If I tug it down a little and belt it though it's no problem. I had previously ordered the same dress in a different pattern in a Medium, and the waistline was better, but the bodice was slightly loose, which is why I ordered the small.


Overall, great dress!!! Say yes!!


This dress is beautiful. All the reviews said to order up and I'm glad I did. The dress fits loose, but with a better belt it will be perfect. The belt fits, but doesn't look good with the dress.


This is the first dress I have ordered from Amazon and I could not be more pleased.  Using the sizing chart provided, I ordered a medium dress (as I am 5"6" inches, bust size is 34 and weigh 136 pounds) and the dress fits to perfection with no gaps at the bust or waist line.  The dress is very well made with high quality fabric, in beautiful vibrant colors,  it has perfectly finished seams that are straight and lie flat, and the skirt lands right below my knee.  I also bought the tutu skirt slip to go underneath and it gives the bottom of the dress just the right amount of body at the base allowing the dress hang perfectly and swirl when you spin in a circle. This dress is an amazing value for the price!!


I'm torn on this dress. I wanted it for a long time based on reviews and buyer pics. I'm 5'9 size 22. The dress is pretty. But fabric is thin.  It felt a bit snug along the seam at the waist but a bit big and loose along the shoulders. It also was a bit shorter than I expected. Came just above the knee. The Petticoat does not come with it so it does not have the fullness as shown in the pictures. The petticoat would bring it knee length. And yes I followed the size chart. Overall its cute and I will wear it but my expectations were high and I was left somewhat dissapoibted. I won't be buying the other colors as originally planned


I was very surprised when it came it look just like the picture... bought it for my sister to wear to a wedding and she looked great in it... she's wearing the XL in size...


So the first time I ordered this dress I ordered a 3x plus and when I got it it was way too big in the top so I sent it back. Then I ordered it a second time thinking I was going to just get it altered.  I ordered a 3x instead of a 3x plus and it fit perfectly!!! THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE BUST AND WAIST OF THE 3X AND THE 3X PLUS!!!!! I am in love with this dress the material is really nice and soft and stretchy and easy to wear and it fits me like a glove I bought this dress and Petticoat from the same maker I'm going to wear them on the cruise we're taking next week so for $40 I got a great dress I'm super excited.
