cute - but runs one size small


Very pretty dress, just a little large, I will take it in for a good fit


Dress makes me look pregnant. Waste is way too high. Nice material.


This is an adorable dress. I got a size large, fits like a large. Its a little shorter than I expected it to be, but other than that its great.


I am a plus size. The dress was true to size and incredibly flattering


Slightly bigger than expected but a great fit overall. I love the full skirt!


I'm so happy is beautiful


I received so many compliments. The dress was a show stopper. The quality of the dress is excellent for the price.


I"ts tight in the bust but the next size would have been to big in the waist. Bust over C will be tight.


I loved it!
