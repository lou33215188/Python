We loved this dress, arrived on time, fits as expected XL for women's size 12-14. The fabric is of a quality weight, washed gentle and hung to dry, ironed out minor wrinkling. This looked beautiful with or without the crinoline we also purchased. Twirls in a gorgeous way!


This dress looks so much prettier in person than the pictures.  The colors are great and it is very flattering.  The fabric is shiny, but it looks more satin like than in the picture.


Love it! Nice fit and well made.


Bought this for my friend as a birthday gift! She loved it. Covered at all the right places while flattering the waist and hips. Looks very chic!


love it but wrong size came -- bag said correct size but dress inside was different. bummed that I had to return it but hoping they can just replace with correct. super cute though!


This dress is made out a high quality material, and it looked great on me! The only small issue with it is that it is made for women with a bigger bust, but you can easily fix that by safety pinning the material or getting it hemmed. I followed the other reviews and ordered a size bigger than what I usually wear, and that was honestly the best route to go.


I absolutely love this dress. For me being a heavier set girl, it’s hard for me to find good dresses that fit me well and that I actually like and look good in. I myself got the biggest size just to be safe and it fit me perfectly (I weigh about 300 pounds and am 5’7). I can’t explain how happy I was with this dress.


Its so pretty.  It does fit a little smaller than expected, not much give in the material but still very happy with it.


The dress is really cute. Unfortunately I am 5'11" and it was not designed for my height.


Was a Christmas  gift for a friend.  She loved it
