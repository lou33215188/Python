Small was huge on me. Pretty pattern but..no.


The dress fit great, the belt was too large though.


nice quality, but instead of one size bigger , I should have gone 2 sizes bigger.


Looks great on but runs small around the chest area.


Really cute. Nice product for the price. Just was a tad short. Fit knee length.


Beautiful dress, well worth the money. Excellent quality!


Manufacturer sent the wrong size and had to return for an exchange.  Liked the material,


The bust was too large and had to be taken in.  It's a nice looking dress but the material is stiff, wrinkles easily and is not very comfortable to wear.


Love it.. but it was a little too small. But gives me motivation to work out


So in love with this dress!!!!
