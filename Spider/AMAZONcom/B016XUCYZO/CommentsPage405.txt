I love the dress. My husband really liked it as we have classic cars and I wear it when we go out in them.


Very impressed with material and dress. Wore it a couple weeks ago and received a lot of compliments.


I absolutely LOVE this dress!  It fit perfectly and I had so many compliments on it.  It was also super comfortable to wear all day and night while attending a wedding.


Awesome quality for the money


Beautiful dress, but the sizing is way way off.. on the small side.


I purchased for a vintage themed event but this is cute enough to wear as a regular dress. I plan to buy a few additional colors!


I'm good with this purchase.  I'm a size 2 - 4 and I ordered a medium - probably should have ordered a small --- just wasn't sure


The fit is absolutely perfect and the dress overall is a great one for any occasion, pattern depending. So in love with the look and material, well everything, I'll probably order more.


Sooooo pretty, but the length is a littler longer than I expected. The top was perfect for me, though.


I originally ordered a size XL, but it did not fit from the waist up.  I am a size 16.  Had to return them and reordered and got them at a size 3X.  Fit perfectly.  Love the colors and design.
