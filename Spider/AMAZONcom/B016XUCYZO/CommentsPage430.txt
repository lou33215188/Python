Fit like a glove. Very flattering!


Love this!!! Posting pic tomorrow!!!


I was able to wear this dress twice before the seams began to come undone. I am VERY disappointed in the quality of this item. I'm unable to give less than one star on this.


Dress wasn't right


My wife is very happy with this dress


Pleasantly surprised with this dress. Fits well, great fabric, looks amazing.


I've received tons of compliments every time I wear this dress!!! I love it!!


I'm high waisted, usually fitting best into petite sizes ( petite extra-large, isn't that weird ?) This fit was close, but not quite right.


Beautiful dress but runs extremely small.


the first one i order was small so i reordered and i order it too big but am goin


to have it taken in from the waist area up
