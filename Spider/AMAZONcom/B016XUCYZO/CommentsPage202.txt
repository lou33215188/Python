This was absolutely adorable and I got so many compliments on it on my cruise last Thanksgiving! Paired it with a cute black petticoat to give it some retro flare and it was perfect!


I really love this dress. It's so well made and with good (not great though) material. It fits perfectly too. Not too enamored with the belt so had to change it. It's worth the price


Great material, thick and smooth soft blend! Does run large, I'm a 6 and it was a little big-put a wide belt on it and it was good.


Love the dress.  Fit as expected.  I am 5"2" and it was at my knee so not too short.  Was disappointed it did not come with detailed washing instructions.


Fantastic dress, great value and really well made. I have worn and washed several times and it looks great.


This dress has zero flow and hangs like a plastic table cloth cover. Very disappointed in this dress I can never wear.


A cute dress! Would recommend.


This nicely fit my plus pre-tween. It is constructed from quality material with good construction. Thank you for making a dress that can be age-appropriate.


I ordered this dress for my friends wedding. Suppose to be Prime shipping but was delivered  late. The dress its self is super cute, however there were brown spots on the bottom of the back shirt. I was able to apply a Tide pen and remove them. Overall I really like this dress and would recommend purchase just allow for delayed shipping.


Love, love, love. Had to order a size larger than I normally do, so the sizing is small, but it is perfect!
