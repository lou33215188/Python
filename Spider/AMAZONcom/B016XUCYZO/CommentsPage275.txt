Very cute dress!!!! well made, color is good. dress is as expected.


Bought this dress worried it would not fit ( I am 5' 4", 145 lbs, and a 34DD) but it fit well! I cannot wait to wear it for Christmas! Bought a tool skirt to go under it to add some flare and I am glad that I did.


This fit perfectly as the chart describes.  I received more compliments on the dress than any other dress I've ever worn.  It is well made, and I can't wait to order another!  I may end up with every pattern for the price!


This dress is beautiful but I'm going to have to lose a little for it to fit.  It's well made.


Wife is happy ğŸ™‚.


Took measurements of chest and waist it fit perfectly. Only downside it's dry clean only, but ehh. And the belt is kinda flimsy, but so cute no one even noticed that


I was hesitant to buy any type of clothing item from Amazon after hearing horror stories. It fit like a glove and such comfortable material. I will be purchasing different designs of this same dress. ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


I love this dress. The fabric is very nice and thicker than I thought it flows perfectly. I'm going to order more of them. This was a perfect selection for me. I'm heavy in the middle section and I don't feel insecure with this dress on.


I bought this as a gift. The only problem I foresee is that it will be too short for the person I bought it for. The quality is good. Very nice cotton and the colors are lovely.


Beautiful dress. I would recommend.
