Very pretty dress.  The size was slightly tight, but worked.  Delivery was very quick and the dress looked great in pictures!


Bautiful dress.  It was well made.  Great fabric.  The style is perfect.  It is true to size (using size chart provided).


Gorgeous dress. Very comfortable. Fits as expected.


This dress is very fitted. Not overly flattering unless you are very thin.


Very pretty dress ! Material is good and flowy. I am 5' 120 lbs L fits great ! I look slim and long in this dress ! Will buy in other colors as well !


Horrible!!! I ordered the red dress for my daughter's graduation and received a weird red cape instead.  A cape like the kind a kid would wear with a Halloween costume! My daughter was so disappointed. Based on the other reviews we expected better. Buyers beware!


It fit great when I tried it on, but after washing it it shrunk.


Perfect fit. No worries. Excellent quality.


I ordered two different color dresses, one in a XS and one in a SM.  The XS fit perfectly (I wear a size 2), but I will keep the SM as it was only slightly big.  The empire waist provides a nice silhouette.  The belt could be made from higher quality material.  Received many compliments on the cut and vintage style of the dress!


May return as the neck line is very high and it is tight in the bust area. But a beautiful dress. Vibrant colors...just wish it fit better.
