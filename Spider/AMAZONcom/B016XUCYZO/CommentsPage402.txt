This is  a great dress  i bought it for my  daughter.  she is 140 lbs i took the medium.


The material  is excellent.


This is a great buy


It was exactly what I had expected; beautiful dress.


Nice fabric. Not too thin. It is dry clean only however. The dress is just below the knee length which is great to me. Can be worn with or without crinoline. Looks just like the picture!


very cute!


I'm about a size 16 dress and struggled with which size to purchase. The 1X was a perfect fit! Just follow the sizing chart and you she be all set! :)


I love it!! It's perfect for me. The dress comes in a very cute package. The material is high quality. According to the size chart I am size M and fits as expected.
