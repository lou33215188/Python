I really like this dress! It has a great fit! The only issue is the belt. It is cheap, and it is too large. I will have to use another belt.


Great


Beautiful dress and very good quality too for the prize.


Size is smaller than expected


Awesome Dress!


It arrived without a belt and the hem was uneven on one side.


There was no belt with my dress.


I love this dress! I wore it to my bridal shower that was held outside and it was great!! Got many compliments too


size not as stated on tag


Very cheap material. Description is a lie. The reviews I read were not truthful. Not worth the purchase
