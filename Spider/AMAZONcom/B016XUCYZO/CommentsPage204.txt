I absolutely love this dress! I bought it wear for Easter so many compliments. It fits amazingly. I will be buying more from this company. Highly recommend!!!


Dress fight a little tight through the waist and torso.  Other than that, I loved it!  It was retro, fun, and 50â€™s sexy!  Great dress for a casual date night.


Good quality material. The cut is really flatering. I coud of ordered it in a size smaller but I followed the reviews. This product is true to size.


This is a cute number! Am definitely getting it in other colors! I bought a petticoat to wear underneath it. I am ready for that thanksgiving dinner!


This dress is beautiful and it fit as the site said it would fit. Highly Recommend.


I am 5'7", 36b and 156lbs. This dress fitted perfectly. The shinny silky look added to a classy finish. I would recommend this dress.


Beautiful dress and well made. I only returned it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.


Wore to a spring tea party, a lot of compliments.


fits perfectly but looks aweful, hard rough material will easily get ruined after a few washes. Horrible material quality.


Looks black in the photo but this dress is navy. Fits perfectly.
