I'm addicted to these dresses. They fit great and yield multiple compliments.


Love the dress, quality product.


I am an 19 year old female, the dress is very unflattering to my curvy body shape, and appears to be for a much older person, but makes me look very wide. However it fit great, dress fell below my knees.


Wonderful fit. Great color and pattern. Wrinkles pretty easily.


It was much smaller than I expected. A nicely made dress with a beautiful shape.


Excellent quality fabric. Will buy more!


One of my favorite dresses. True to size and color


I love this dress!! I would love to model for her


Very cute. Perfect size. Looks like you are in the 50s


This dress is beautiful !! Love it is just like in the pic
