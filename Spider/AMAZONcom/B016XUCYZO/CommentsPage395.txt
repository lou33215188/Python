Love the fit, love the style. Planning to purchase more.


This dress is so cute and I always receive compliments. I could have ordered the extra small one but with a belt, size small fits good. Price is good too! Love it!!


I love this dress!!!  It fits perfectly! It's packaged beautifully and it is great quality  material! On top of that you can't  beat that price!  My only dislike is the tag was sewed in the seem which caused me to have to repair after I got it out!


Runs pretty close true to size.  This was too large, returned for a smaller size.


This is such a georgous dress! The extra small fit me very well! Im 5' so I thought it would be to long but its perfect! I just ordered dress #2!

Wonderful dress, received many compliments. Didn't wrinkle all day and evening. Would recommend this dress.
