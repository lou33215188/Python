Love love love my dress


Beautiful fit, pattern, fabric. Used with petticoat. Belt is a bit large. But love this dress, buying more in other colors.


My daughter (5' 81/2" 125lbs) wore a size small with a tan belt and matching shoes to her bridal shower. It was perfect. I recommend the petticoat too.


Needs a full slip because it is not lined but it is beautiful and fit well


Returned it and got the next size smaller. Perfect


Very comfortable material, fit perfectly and looked adorable. Quality seems good so far.


Seriously the cutest dress I could imagine for my friend's wedding!!  Very flattering for all body shapes.  I also feel like it will be comfortable throughout the day.


Beautiful dress! Arm holes fit a bit tight.


Fits my wife just right she loves it


The fit and length is perfect, I received so many compliments on this dress. I wore it with bright blue shoes to add a pop of color and it was a hit! Highly recommend it
