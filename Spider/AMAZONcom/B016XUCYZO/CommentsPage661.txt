Love this style of dress this one fits well. I am 5'5", a 36DDD/E, with pretty good size hips (4 kids), 165lbs and I ordered a large and I love the fit. Material is not necessarily the greatest out there, but great for the price. Great dress.


Beautiful dress, very well made, but larger than sizing suggested. I didn't think I was that big, but didn't want the waist to be tight. I will be altering rather than returning it.


Beautiful dress!!! I ordered it in one color, and loved it so much I bought it in this color, and I hope to wear it to homecoming!


Very nice dress. HUGE skirt on the bottom. Very hard to iron on low heat, but nothing a good steamer can't take care of.


Pretty dress, smelled kind of off when I opened it from the package. Very small bust on this so if you have any sort of chest it will feel a bit tight up top.


Solid cotton material and beautiful vibrate flower print, love the dress!


I really love this dress because it had a very goo design and this one is really well made. I am happy that I bought it. Really worth buying!


looked great. no complaints


I love how it fit and it was comfortable.  I got so many  compliments.
