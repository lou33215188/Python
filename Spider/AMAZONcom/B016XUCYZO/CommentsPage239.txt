Really cute dress, just a bit snug but that might be my fault for eating like crap lately. I will need to get it hemmed but that's typical since I'm not even 5' tall. Can't wait to wear it to my cousin's wedding in a few weeks.


I just love it.  It has such beautiful bright colors. Runs small.


This dress is beautiful and looks terrific. I would buy it again. It did arrive on time.

This dress is the cutest and is very well made. The only complain I have is that the large fits perfectly over my boobs (36 DD) the waist area is about two and a half to three inches too loose. But the belt helps with the loose waist situation! Very happy with my purchase.


Very lovely and comfortable dress. I actually stole this idea of styling from one of your reviews that had a picture. So thanks for the pictures and reviews


I got so many raving reviews for this dress. Its so elegant and very comfortable. I am going to buy more colors. I wore it for the debut of my play that I wrote. Everyone kept telling me I looked like a doll. I love it!
