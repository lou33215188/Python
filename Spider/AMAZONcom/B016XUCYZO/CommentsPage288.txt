Perfect fit! I love this dress!


Dress is very cute and good quality.  Originally wrote a review less positive because the wrong dress was sent.  The error was corrected and am very happy


I ordered this for a Derby party. The fit, look and quality was better than expected.  Not to mention the impressive delivery.


My daughter wore this for a school play.  She loved it.  She is looking for another event she can wear it for.


Needed an Easter dress.  I'm 5'11" and weigh around 400 pounds. As you can imagine clothed don't usually look good on me neither am I terribly comfortable in them. This dress was appropriately long ad well as flattering on my rather round figure. I love this dress and will be busing more.


I loved the dress but this medium ran smaller compare to another dress.  I bought the same dress in the pokey dots and it fit and a little longer which I loved.


The size was a but to large.  So I reordered it.  The New dresses fit beautifully.  So Thank you very much


I ordered a size up and it fits perfectly - love it!!


I really like this dress. The print is very pretty. I like the material too. I did have to take it up about a inch in the shoulders for it to fit me correctly. I'm looking forward to wearing it for a upcoming wedding reception. ğŸ˜ŠğŸ’™
