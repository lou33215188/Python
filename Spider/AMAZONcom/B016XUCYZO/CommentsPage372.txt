Perfect fit!  Good quality


This dress is beautiful!  My daughter is wearing it to her middle school prom. It fits as it should. Great quality material and construction.


Love this dress. Lightweight material.


although it was too small for me around the waist, i kept it nonetheless bu gave to my daughter and fits her fine. So I still give this a goo rating.


Average size ladies it fits fine, if you are 6ft like myself it is very tight in the neck area. Gave dress to my sister and she looked great in it. 2x and she is 5'5 and wears a 18. Hope this helps! Pair of red heels and it's the cutest!!


Really cute. I dress it up with heels an dress it for casual wear with flats.


I LOVE this dress!It has a little give and fits so well!I will for sure be getting more of these but other patterns!


I'm will attending an event with a Southern Belle theme and the dress fits perfect! The fabric is a lot nicer than expected for the price. I have already recommended friends to purchase your dresses.


I love this dress. I'm short and pear shapped, the cut hides my hips and really balances my torso out. I do wish the belt was wider. But other wise, no complaints. Just go up a size from what you would wear.


I loved this dress I’m normally a size 2x/3x but decided to order up to a 4x but it’s a little to loose on the top anfythe bottom is a little more fitting.
