Cute, but you can definitely tell it wasn't built to last. Perfect for my halloween costume though.


beautiful dress. ordered a medium based on my natural waist and it was simply lovely


Ordered a 3x, it was labelled as that but would inly fit a size 12 woman. Ridiculously small. A joke. Dont bother.


Lovely dress. Fits as expected.  A little lycra in the material helps.


While the size I ordered was a bit too big I still love the dress and was impressed with the quality


It's a beautiful dress and  I'll be purchasing more from this designer.


It was shorter than I was expecting...otherwise it was cute.


The fit was too small and the fabric was too thin. ğŸ˜•


Way too small in the bust. Am requesting a return


It'a little too short and too small.
