one of my favorite dresses


Dress look amazing. Hot-hot-hot... Love it. Very good quality. I order medium at first but it was smaller that I expected. But large fit perfectly.


Wasn't sure about the sizing as I wear sizes 8-12 (M/L) in women's, so I ordered both a L and XL. Tried the L on first and it fit!  As a curvy gal I was impressed by how much the dress flattered my curves. I did not purchase a crinoline as I have hips. My natural curves provided enough fullness to the skirt. The waist is at your natural waist, so don't expect it to sit lower on your torso. I'm 5'4" and it fell just below my knees. The bust fit just right, I'm a 36C. The black belt is cheap, but the dress (white with large black dots) would look great with a wider belt in black or red. The material is thicker cotton, and is well made. Definitely plan to order it in additional prints!


Just got mine!!!! Because I'm alittle busy I went up a size and it fits like a dream. This dress stats true to the size chart! It makes me feel feminine and playful. Love the fabric bc it breaths. I'm definitely going to but more after Christmas!! I feel so pretty. The belt also fits with your size so if you have alittle room up top the belt hides it


My wife looks great in this dress!


Awesome dress, great quality, rocked the wedding!


This was a great buy , probably one of the best buys I've gotten in a long while. I was very surprised at the quality of the material.  You won't be disappointed in this buy. It's worth every penny.  I'm currently browsing the different options in order to buy a second dress.


Thank you for bringing this to Amazon.


Pretty dress for the price. I ordered it too large though.


Super cute dress!  It is very flattering and comfortable.  Looks great with a petticoat underneath.


Gorgeous dress, back was not wide enough, next size would have been to big, returned
