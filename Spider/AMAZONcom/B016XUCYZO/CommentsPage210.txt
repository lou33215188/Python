The prettiest dress. I purchased the. Lack with white polka. So so pretty. Very flattering for apple shapes.


I absolutely LOVE this dress! I'm 5' 10" 125 lbs small chested and this fits me like a glove. I got a small.


I would have preferred a better material it is real cotton the kind that wrinkles a lot , I haven't worn it yet so I don't know how it will be when I sit down.


Fit well everywhere except my DD chest


Nice quality. Pretty pattern.


I absolutely love this dress. Bought it for a cruise I went on a couple of years ago and fell in love. The material of the dress is thin and makes it perfect to wear in hot weather. The only downside is that it’s not good in the sun for a long period of time. Overall I’m very satisfied.


Perfect fit. Looks great and is comfortable!


Cute dress with a skirt the flares out nicely. Rich wine color. Fit as predicted based on the seller's guide. I bought a couple of items for an event and ended up not keeping this one but I would definitely order it again, perhaps in a different color.


The dress is absolutely gorgeous and is made of high quality material. I only had had one issue with the dress, which was the size. I'm 5'2 and 155 pounds. I usually wear size medium, but ordered a large based on other reviews. Even the large is quite snug in the bust for me. Other than that, it's wonderful. I also ordered a petticoat to add a little poof to it because the dress has very little on its own.


Absolutely ADORE this dress & always get pleasant compliments!  Will order again.
