Super cute dress for the price, but I returned it, as I didn't like the fit.


The chest area of this dress is too big for my daughter. It fit everywhere else, but the bust was kind of pointy. It looked like there were molded bra cups in there, but there wasn't. It was just a weird fit.


Matron of Honor absolutely loved her dress!


Very cute quality dress. Fits like a glove. I'm 5'4 180lbs with a 38F  and the 1xl fit perfectly.


Love this dress! I've gotten so many compliments! A little long, I'm 5'4" and wish it was just a tad shorter. Better wedges or high heels but makes me look short when I wear flats.


Overall very pleased! Had to go a size up though!


I ordered a size larger then I normally wear and it was still too small.


Nice quality, good value, and attractive!


Lovely dress just didn't look good on me. I loved the fact it had a real bust as apposed  to material stretched across your bust.


This dress needs peticote


The design is nice, the fabric is basic, the fit is flattering. I really like this dress.


The product arrived on time and as expected


This dress is beautiful and well made will definitely be buying more!
