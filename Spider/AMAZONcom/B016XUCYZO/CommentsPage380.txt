LOVE IT!


Bought this for my daughter's 8th grade promotion. She has a tulle underskirt and it looks fantastic, she wants to buy every color and make it her outfit of choice for high school next year.


The dress fits perfectly my wife loves it


I love it! It is beautiful...flowly....fit perfectly! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!


This dress has become my favorite!! The compliments I received were too numerous to count and I just felt great in it!! The fit is so comfortable.


Like it a lot, would love it if it was a little bit longer. More of a midi fit


I bought it a size-up and it fits great! A little see through for the white so I just make sure to wear a slip or light undergarments.


I love the print on this dress. It’s perfect for summer. Can’t wait to wear it.


So many compliments on it every time I wear it to church everyone comments on how lovely it looks I always wear the Kremlin under it and it certainly is a good product  I am looking to buy a second one


I love this dress! I bought it to wear to a Kentucky Derby party. Looks great & fits great! I highly recommend getting this dress!
