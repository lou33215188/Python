Love this dress. So many compliments, wore with the petticoat and just made me feel beautiful.


Love the dress. Size smal fits the length and hip/waist right except on the shoulder amd armpit area (its somewhat tight)


LOVE THIS DRESS. I did not buy a petty coat as many other did and I am totally ok with the look and if fact think it would be to much for me. I am 5'4 and I36 pounds. (Smaller waist and BIGGER hips.) Dress is very flattering on me. I bought a Med and it fits great!.


I'm a size 18. The XL was a perfect fit. It's flows nicely and has a nice fit, flare to the dress. The undershirt/slip was great. Fits nicely and it not itchy


The dress itself is gorgeous. The fabric is of great quality and the construction is very good. My only issue is, even sizing up which all the reviews suggested there is no room in the chest. I am pretty busty but I don't see where anyone over a B cup would fit in it unless you ordered a 3X and then it would be too big everywhere else. I think the pattern for the top is just totally wrong. I wish it wasn't because I loved the look!


I get so many compliments on this dress


Inexpensive and super cute.  I wore it to a wedding with a ruffled slip underneath and received many compliments.


very pretty and very affordable. seems to be well made especially for the price.


I am so over in love with this dress! Hands down my favorite dress of all TIMES!!


Beautiful. My daughter loves it. She wants more in similar cut, but different colors, of course.
