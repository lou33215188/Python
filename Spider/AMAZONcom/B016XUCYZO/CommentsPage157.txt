This was prettier than the photo and VERY well made! Fit perfect. Looks good with or without the belt.


I originally ordered a 3x and a 4x because I thought I would be between sizes (I wear a 40H) but I actually had to go down to a 2x.  I got compliments ALL night when I wore this dress.  It's absolutely adorable.


The fabric of this dress is very pretty.  It is tight in the waist but I will be able to get it altered.


Beautiful sateen fabric.  I usually wear a size 6 and the Medium fits nicely.  Ordered one, to make sure the fit was OK and, now, plan to order other prints / colors.  Very pleased.


I normally wear a size 14, but the XL was too small. I returned it and reordered a 2XL and that fit correctly. Cute dress, great price, I may order another.


Beautiful and can't wait to wear it.  Fits perfect.


This is my favorite dress. It is a little sheer dbut with the petticoat it is not bad. I highly recommend getting the petticoat cause it polishes this dress off all the more.


This dress is absolutely amazing! It can be dressed up or down depending on the event making it incredibly versatile. I own three! Last year I purchased the white one with black flowers for my promotion ceremony then, a the navy for a wedding and now the black for hoco! On all three occasions the  dress was brilliant! My one complaint is that the bust size is a bit too big and even when I wear a push-up bra(32b) it doesn't fill out


Nice stretch to fit a very curvy chest (36 D-DD). Flattering and comfortable. Excellent value!


Beautiful dress. I bought this for my 12 year old for Easter. It does run a bit small in the waist. I ordered her the large and it just barely zipped. She normally wears a kids XL (16/18) or adult medium.
