The most darling dress I have ever seen!!! A steal for the price. Is it top quality? No but if you wear it to one event you saved money. That is not saying it will only last for one event. You will need to use special care in cleaning. Can I say again how lovely this fits my petite daughter? She will wear to a special church function coming up. So excited with this purchase.


I bought this for my mom and she loved it it fit perfectly.


I was very pleased with the quality and fit of this dress. Several cheap dresses I've gotten on Amazon have had to get new zippers, but this one works just fine!


This dress is AMAZING!! So beautiful.  I wore it to a Kentucky Derby party and it was perfect Highly recommend!!!!!


I am 5 ft 2 in, about 130 pounds and I bought a size large. I really love the color and the fit I am very happy with it, it made me feel confident. My only problem with it is after 1 wear i seem to have pulled a seam and there is a line showing on one side of the dress


Well made! Fits my 15 yr old perfectly! She is thrilled with it. She plans to wear it not only for a theater costume but also to formal events.


I am very pleased with this dress. This is the first time I have ordered a Grace Karin dress and I am very happy to say that it is well made and fits exactly as I expected. The fabric is of high quality and the stitching is well done.


The dress fabric is sateen and there is no stretch at all.  That said, I still love it but will not be able to use it for a daily work dress.  I ordered an XL and it is pretty true to a US 14.


This dress is a great value for the price however the skirt was too full and the waist was too high. It was just not a good fit for me


This dress is beautiful.  I ordered my usual size and it was a bit too tight, I couldn't close the zipper at my rib cage.  I returned it and got the next size up which fits perfectly and I absolutely love.
