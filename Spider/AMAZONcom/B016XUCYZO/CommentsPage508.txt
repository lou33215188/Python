I get a lot of complements when I wear it with the petticoat.


It's a little to tight in the chest.  If you have a C or higher, I would recommend one size larger.


This dress is wonderful,great quality for the price. The color is beatuiful. And it's the truth size.


Beautiful dress! The material is great! Fitted as expected


Love this dress! I will definitely be buying more in other colors. The fit and length are perfect as well. I'm 5'6, 135 lbs., and I ordered the dress in a small.


Love the dress. I shortened it just a bit as I like my dresses above the knee.


I was really hoping this would fit, but it's built for people with absolutely no torso! From the bottom of the armhole (which DOES NOT come low) to the waist is <6". The waist was just barely under my bra-line and was extremely unflattering. I'm returning it today!


I will say, that for the price, it was better quality than expected.


nice


This dress fit just as expected.  Nice thick material.  A great dress for the price.  I wore a red crinoline under it and received so many compliments on this dress.


Just a little small but still gorgeous
