Love this dress!  I ordered a size Small for my 14 year-old daughter.  She's usually a size 2 in the junior department.  Very cute.


Loved the dress! The material was nice and thick. Well made. Shopped on time. Great buy!


Beautiful material!! Fits great!! I wish it was a little longer as it falls above my knees... just my preference.

Beautiful! I love wearing this and the fit was perfect. It's made of a nice thick fabric as well so it looks very nice on.


Great material but should have ordered a size smaller. Easy to take in so no big deal.
