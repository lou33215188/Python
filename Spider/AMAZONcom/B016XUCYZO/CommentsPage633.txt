Cute cute dress........ I am just to fat


Dress is beautiful more than expected.. Can't wait to wear it!!!!


Bought for my daughter. She absolutely loves it.


Dress was nice but it was too small.


Love this dress!! Exchanges it for one size larger and ordered more in different colors. It is super flattering and I love the cotton material


This is my new favorite dress. I am 5'8 and 140lbs and this dress fits like a glove. I will be wearing this ALL the time.


Very lovely but I have problems with the zipper.


I really love this dress it is somewhat tight at the front and the zipper is hard to go up, but when it does and the dress is on it look very good


This dress is so comfortable and fits just right.  It is actually a little longer than it looks, which is a great thing for me.


The sizing was not true. Unfortunately due to life events I missed the window of return, but this was not able to be worn.
