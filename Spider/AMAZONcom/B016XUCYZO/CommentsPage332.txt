A little big at the top but Otherwise i absolutely love how it fits!


It's so gorgeous and was better than I expected ! I'm 5'1 about 105 lbs and I ordered a small. I wanted it to be below the knee and it did. The quality is superb for the cost of the dress. I'm so happy with my purchase :)


This is such a cute dress! I bought it for a wedding and now have it in multiple colors. It’s fun and girly and can be played up with a poofy petticoat underneath! For this price, you can’t go wrong!


Wife likes it.


Didnt like the silky material and it fits too large.. bought a 4x and wished I bought 2x.


Love this dress, it is as good as the reviews say.


My wife loved the fit look's so fine in it !


What I received was not AT ALL what was pictured. They use a dress template to show off their fabric patterns and do not inform you that what you receive will likely be a different style. Can't even return it. Don't waste your money.


I can get the dress to zip up but because of where the waistline sits I look nine months pregnant. As I loose weight I feel like the waistline will look better.


Love this dress
