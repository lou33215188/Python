Love it! I got so many compliments on it.


I want to change this dress because I did not like the color I would like the colors black and white instead


I purchased a 1x but the my bust was too large for it.  I loved the dress


The fit is as expected. Though the belt is large. Once it was pressed, it falls beautifully. And a good length as well.


Its not even close to accurate sizing.


I loved it, but it was too large around the torso so I had to return it :(


Very high quality for the price. I love it.


Fits perfectly!  Only thing I wish is they matched-up/blended the pattern better where the top and shirt  meet at the waist seam.


Very nice dress.


This Is a beautiful dress! The material is a nice weight and the colors are crisp and well-defined. The fit is perfect on me!
