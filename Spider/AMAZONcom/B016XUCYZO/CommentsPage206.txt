This dress rocks.  It fit perfectly, true to size (which was not the case one bit with other similar dresses on here).  I am going to order a few more in other colors!


I love, love, love this dress. I just got mine today and I tried it on and it fit perfectly. I'm extremely hourglass shaped and it's hard to find a dress that won't be short in the back and this one was the same length all the way around. Don't skip the petticoat it adds so much to this already great dress! I bought it for my engagement photos and I'm so excited I did. I'm gonna buy so many more!


The bodice fits as expected, but I was expecting a somewhat longer skirt based on the photos.


Great fit, the skirt looks great but definitely needs a petticoat. Loved the dress very classic, looks great.


I absolutely love these dresses! I have 3.


I'm  just too fat to be honest ...well made -its ok


Just Beautiful, and you can't beat the price! I'm 5', 102lbs & 34C -the dress falls just past the top of my knee, and while the bust is a bit snug, I have come to expect that from every dress because of my proportions.


The fabric is amazing and so thick.


I expected it to be thing and cheaply made due to its price, but it's the exact opposite! I love it and the colors are so vibrant. Looks exactly like it does in the given image!! Doesn't even need the belt to look nice either!


The belt is also very nice and is soft.


Fits perfect and looks amazing. With so many color choices I just keep buying these for my girlfriend. And she loves them.


Material is bad. Heavy and thick. Especially the skirt. But the pattern and the design looks so nice when you wear it. Probably will keep it.
