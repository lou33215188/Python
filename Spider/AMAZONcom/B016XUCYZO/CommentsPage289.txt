Everyone loved the dress, purchased the under garment tule to poof it out a bit... Perfect!


My daughter is short and tiny and the small was big on her a bit but looked beautiful so I'm getting it tailored to fit her better.  It's truly a quality dress and beautiful too.


I love the cut of this dress more than I can say.  The pattern is wonderful and is was exactly as pictured.  If you are looking for a 1950's dress, this style is it.  I did put a crinoline under it to give it that 50s dress shape but at 5'3, it hit right at my knee.


Had to return because the top part was a little snug. Ordered the same style but halter so there is not as much restriction. Overall, very cute and if it fit I would have kept it.


This dress fit me perfectly, and I am 240lbs, a size 16 and wear a 40DD bra. The only thing is that it is not knee length on me. I am 5'7.


This dress was a stunner. The material is beautiful but needed some ironing. I felt like a 50's model! Many compliments on how well it fit!


Bought a solid dress from same company in the same size and it fit great.  This one is just too big in the bodice.


Much higher quality than expected for the price.  I ordered a large (I wear a 10-12), so it was a little loose but I would rather that than too tight.  Looking forward to order more in different styles!


I have to return it. It's too snug.


Maybe in an larger size I'll like it.


The fabric is thinner than expected.


This dress is so pretty!  I love the fit and how it looks on.  Can't wait to wear it to work!
