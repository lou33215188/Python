Beautiful dress great cut! Returned bc I wanted a different color but it’s a great dress for the price!


The dress is beautiful and the cloth quality is really nice the only thing I didn't like is I ordered to fit my waist and the top is a bit saggy trying to alter to fit better but the construction makes it a bit difficult to do but over all a very beautiful dress


Bought this dress on a whim for engagement photos. It fit as expected and was so beautiful. I live the vintage style. I purchased the underskirt to give it more volume and the price of both combined was less than any dress marketed for pre-wedding events.


I love this dress. It's fits well, but the material is stretchy; it has some give to it. The skirt flares out without needing a pouffy slip underneath, but it's not stiff; there's a bit of swirl.


At 5'3, the 1-x comes down just below the knees.


This fit as expected because others had said it ran small so I order a size up, SO ORDER A SIZE UP! Can't believe this dress was under $30. I get a lot of complements when I wear it.


I love it! It fit like a glove. I’m a size 6 and the Small fit me perfectly.


I was expecting the fabric a little shinier, it’s very matte, but fits good.


I just got this dress today and am SO IMPRESSED! It fits great and seems like great quality. It is a little big but that is due to the fact that I am apple shaped and between sizes. It is comfortable and classy and I can't wait to wear it!


The material of the dress is great. I did not expect it to be so thick.Would buy again in another print.


adorable and fits perfectly!


Going to purchase more in different patterns & colors!
