Gorgeous!!!!!!!!


The torso is very short on this dress. It is very boxy and it is also not as long as I expected. It is an adorable dress, except for my long torso. I am going to keep it and alter it.


Excellent fit and beautiful dress. Great quality and was better than expected for the price. Very happy and will definitely buy from this seller again!


Very cute! I bought a small but the waist was a little too baggy but not noticeable. The belt was too big to wear around my waist, it was more fitting around my hips.


This is a classic type of dress. I loved it because it reminds me of the 50s an 60s, even though I was born in the 90s XD It's a beautifu dress and I wore it for my 4th year anniversary with my boyfriend.


This dress is so cute but when I ordered a medium according to my measurements, it ended up being too big in the waist and too long in the shoulders. I ordered the small and it fit perfectly, just wish I didnt have to return it and then order a new one to get there.


This dress is gorgeous. It fits perfectly. It was just as beautiful as Iâ€™d hoped it would be.


Gorgeous on and true to size!


bought this for my wife. she loves it. she wears a medium and it fits. very nice.


Beautiful dress. It fits perfectly and I get compliments for everyone. Will definitely order in another color.
