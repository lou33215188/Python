I love this dress. However mine did not come with a belt, and it is not lined, therefore extra fabric at the top seam kind of pokes out of the arm holes. I haven't decided how to fix this issue yet- either some wonder under, liquid stitch, or just cut the flap out. I did measure before I ordered that is why I order the size up because I was in between the xxl and the xxxl. I was expecting the xxxl to be a bit loose, but it is actually kind of snug. I am glad I ordered the size up. ***** update. The belt situation was resolved. The people were so cordial and easy to deal with. I would definatly buy from this shop again. Also i fixed the fabric flap with a little stitchwitchery.
