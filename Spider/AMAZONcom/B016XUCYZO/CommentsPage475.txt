Very high waist, more like a princess waistline. Much higher than picture shows. Beautiful, soft fabric.


Beautiful dress.  The shape is great, the pattern is perfect and it is so well made.  The price was even better.  Quite happy.


Used.  Deodorant stains in arm holes. Didn't come with the belt.  Wadded up in the bag.


Great dress and material. It fits perfectly. Will be purchasing more.


It is beautiful and i feel like a princess in it....


This dress fit ok, but was very, very difficult to get in and out of.


I get SO many compliments on this dress, it fits true to size. I'm 5'8" and very curvy, and this dress is amazing. Highly recommend!


Its a beautiful dress. Fabric is really nice quality also.


This dress is wonderful! I will be purchasing from  you again.  Wonderful material and great fit!


Great little dress.  Bought for a 50's party.  But i would wear it to any event it is cute and well made
