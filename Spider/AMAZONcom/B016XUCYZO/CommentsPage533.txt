Smooth transaction with fast shipment.  Very pleased with product, thanks!!!


I brought the dress in an XL and I am in love with it! Took about a week to get but when I got it fit my perfectly. Would order again.


Based on the sizing chart, I went on the bigger side and ordered a size large. It ended up being very big on me. Other than that it was great.


package came on time and fits beautifully


I love it. Its my style through and through. So many compliments on my first day wearing it.
