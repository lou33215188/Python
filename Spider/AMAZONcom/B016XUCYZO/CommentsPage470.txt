great, used for a graduation!


Very pretty, fits a little big.


I wore this for Easter Sunday and it was great! In general I know my size and that fit & flare is the way to go. I do own a petticoat which I paired under it!


These dresses are so beautiful and fits so well.  My niece was starring in these.


So cute & fit perfectly.  I was repeatedly complimented.  The only negative is the belt. The buckle broke as I was removing it from the packaging.


Beautiful, good quality too.


Lovely dress.  Looks so pretty, and fits well.  Just right for spring.


Absolutely perfect!! I'm 5'3/127. Bought a Sm. Fits well in the chest and hits below the knee. It's by far my favorite dress yet!


The dress was a size small which fit well & looked great but the belt that was included was meant for a size Large or XL. I had to buy a different belt that fit correctly.


Beautiful dress
