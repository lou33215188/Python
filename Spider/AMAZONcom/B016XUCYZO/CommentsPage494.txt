The dress fits great but you definately should order it a little bigger (go up 1 size of your normal size).

Awesome


Super cute


It is not tea length as the picture looks. It actually hits just above the knee making it not "vintage" in style. I'm diaasappiinted.


The fabric is nice and sturdy, not wimpy material, and the dress is well made. More than met my expectations, considering the price. Very cute design. I'm very happy with this dress!


I wish the waist fit a little lower on my torso. Otherwise it's a fun dress.
