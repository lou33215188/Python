Th measurements were spot on and it fit perfectly! I receive tons of compliments when I wear it. Thanks again!


LOVE this dress. It's as cute as I'd hoped it would be. I bought before I really looked at the size chart...guess I was looking at the standard amazon chart which sometimes differs from the manufacturers sizes. But it still fit...a little snug, but it fit. Going to buy this in another color. Great for work events, night out with the hubby or special events (weddings / graduations)


Nice dress but not flattering on long-waisted person with tummy.


Amazing dress. Fits a bit bigger at the top I ordered an 4x and it was perfect. I am larger in the stomach area, and small chested but I worked. Great comfortable material easy to iron. I LOVE THIS DRESS! Perfect length for going to church services. I highly recommend this dress to plus size ladies.


Really cute dress. Very nice quality fabric. I'm thinking of ordering another one in a different pattern.


Fits great and is adorable. My daughter is a jr 1-3 and we ordered a xsm.


AWESOME PRODUCT - LOVE THEM!!!!


Dress was really cute, nice materiel. I weigh 180 with hips and 34DDD. I ordered a large, it fit perfect.


I'm a 36D, size 12, very curvy--This dress deserves 10 stars...I love it.  It fit perfectly all over.  Even the belt was awesome because it had more than enough notches for me to tighten it to my comfort level.  Looked great with heels and flats.


Love this dress!  I recieved so many compliments when I wore it.  It fit perfect and I felt great in it!
