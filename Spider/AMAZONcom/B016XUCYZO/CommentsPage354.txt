This dress is beautiful in person. It is a nice silky material and the colors are so vibrant. It fits perfectly! I highly recommend this dress!


Gorgeous dress!  It was a little large, I worry about buying too small so ordered up.  I am 5'7", 165lbs, bust size 36DD and bought an XL.  I used a wider black belt.  Super cute.  With the belt it fit great.
