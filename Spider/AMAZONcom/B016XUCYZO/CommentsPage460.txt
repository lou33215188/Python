My husband bought this for my graduation. I like how it looked on me. It just felt weird for the belt to be right under the breasts. Otherwise a great dress.


I love this dress! It fits perfect and is absolutely adorable. I will be ordering the same one in another color very soon!


Very cute and nice quality!  My daughter wore it to a sweet sixteen party.  Everyone liked it!  Reasonable price too.


Very elegant


Very cute! It's very comfortable as well! It came completely as I expected it to!


Using the size chart was extremely helpful.  My sister was happy with her gift and how it fit.


Very cheap quality, I should have known better.


Great dress . I have heard  "ready, set go" 1 too many times. It's cute , fits well and  there is the petticoat  option.


Really beautiful dress!!! Worth the price


I love this dress! Wore with a petticoat to get the fullness
