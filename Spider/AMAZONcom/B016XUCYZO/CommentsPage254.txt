Love the silky material! Wear a size 12 and an XL is perfect! Bought the skirt to go under which gives it a bit more body, but could go without!


Love this dress! Fits a little loose on my chest area but the rest is perfect!


I ordered 2 of these dresses and am IN LOVE.  I've never felt so gorgeous in a dress before, I wish I had a reason to wear one of them every day!  Great fit, nice fabric, lots of compliments!  I plan on buying several more in different cuts and patterns... for less than $30 this dress is a steal


Very cute dress and I'm excited to wear it out (I haven't had a chance just yet because of the weather). It looks best with a petticoat underneath, so if you're considering getting this dress, I'd recommend buying a petticoat as well.


The only complaint I have is that the belt is too big? The dress fits fine but the belt only has a few notches in it and for how long it is, it makes the belt way too big. I had to make a new one to make the belt fit right.


Beautiful dress. The quality was better than expected. I had to return it for a different size. Runs a bit small because the material is not stretchy. I will definitely consider buying other prints. Consider buying 1 size up.

My daughter loves the classic lines of this dress.  I gave it four stars because it's a bit tight in the arm holes but she likes wearing it anyways. Very easy to take care of and the fit guide was helpful.


Well made! My daughter loves it!


Well made, no Petty coat needed for skirt lift.


beautiful dress, I will surely be getting another!
