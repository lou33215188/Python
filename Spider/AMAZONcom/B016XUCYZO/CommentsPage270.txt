For very well. Like the product a lot.


Beautiful dress, colors were beautiful and fit as expected. Can't wait to wear it again.


It's pretty but the top part is sown incorrectly. There's a small bump where it's supposed to be flat and it looks awkward. Other than that it fits true to size chart.


This dress is beautiful.  I bought for my daughter to wear at Easter.  She felt great in it and loved!  Will definitely buy more.


I loved the dress the only issue I had was the waist was rather high.  About 3 inches above my bellybutton.  A larger/wider belt would help with this.


Absolutely love this dress! Looks great on me and I can't wait to wear it out. Would recommend.


I Love this dress it fit great. I got it in Red w a black belt I only 5'2 was worried about the length being to long , but it was just right. If you are look for something nice to wear this is your dress.


I bought this dress and it came today!


It looked like how it would look in the picture and the color scheme was gorgeous.


However, despite a 2X in dresses usually fitting me, this did not fit me.


Sadly, I'm returning it & upping my sizes. But I also do want to mention some stats to help you with sizing : I am 5'7, I have a 42 inch Bust, my waist is around 46 and my hips are 50. The dress was wonderful around the top half, but the bottom half wasn't so stellar. I would encourage you folks to size up.


The dress is beautiful!


I am 5'5 150lbs and ordered a large based off of my measurements.


When i received it - it was a bit too big, so i returned it for a size M (i'm hoping that one fits).


The material is nice, and with a petticoat underneath it looks AMAZING!


Good quality dress. It comes with the belt accessory. Make sure your measurements are correct and it should fit fine.
