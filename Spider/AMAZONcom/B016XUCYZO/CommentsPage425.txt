Beautiful dress!!! Love it!


Beautiful dress but I'm 5'9 it was too short. Nice material and awesome delivery. But too short and I like to look Modest. And feel comfortable


Words can not describe how much i love this dress.


The zipper in the back has minor imperfections.  The dress itself is separating from the zipper slightly.  Nothing that I can't have fixed, but annoying to have to fix.


I like the fabrics but I think it is kind of larger than my size... but it is easy to fix...I do not like the belt, so I am going to buy one someday...


Adorable on my apple shaped body!
