A lovely quaint dress


Absolutely stunning!  Great quality, incredible price and perfect fit!  My husband's jaw dropped to the floor when he saw me wearing it.  Now, I'm trying to decide which other design I want next!


Absolutely LOVE this dress!!!!! It fits like a glove. I wore it to a wedding and got more compliments than I've ever got on anything. I purchased the dress in red and wore a black petticoat underneath. Now I want one in every color.


Perfect except they seem to use a one size belt which makes its useless unless you're an extra large. However for the price it fit perfectly and very happy with it.


This is a beautiful dress!  For a tall lady like myself, the dress hangs long enough for a modest look.


Loved it! Neckline a little smaller than typical boat neckline, which was actually perfect. Nice fabric, but arrived a bit wrinkled.


It is a perfect dress for several outing si have coming up.


I love the fit and the look.


thank you.

Wore this dress for my bridal shower...people were yelling at me on the street saying my dress was cute. Get a petticoat for it to make it pop!


Slightly snug fit but still giving the dress 5 stars. The quality is excellent! The dress is beautiful! I will absolutely buy this brand again and again!


Fits really nice and it's good quality but didn't come with the belt mentioned in the product title so it's lacking some structure in the waist.
