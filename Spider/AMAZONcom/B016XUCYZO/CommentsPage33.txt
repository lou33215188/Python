I was nervous about buying this dress after having some issues with dresses like this from other brands. But this is a gorgeous little dress that fits me perfectly and is very well constructed. The fabric ensures that the skirt flares just as depicted in the photo. So what you see is what you get. But it's actually even better than I expected. I wasn't planning to wear it for Easter, but I just might switch from the far more expensive dress I bought for the occasion to this one. It's a show stopper!


I was nervous about purchasing a white dress without knowing the material but it is nice and thick. Unfortunately, it is shipped in tight package so it came very wrinkled but the dress itself is very nice quality and beautiful fabric. It appears to be made well. This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it! I like the classy and modest style. She likes the ability to whirl the skirt. The size chart worked perfectly based on my daughter's measurements. The only quirk is that it has a little slack in the upper back of shoulders. This isn't that noticeable and overall it is a great dress. My daughter wants to buy more!


I had this dress on my wishlist for a while but kind of forgot about it. I absolutely love vintage style dresses and my work style is very "vintage meets Jessica day". I NEVER and I mean NEVER like clothes I order online, but I decided to take the leap after reading through reviews on here and I couldn't be happier. It's very flattering, super comfortable and fun to twirl around in ğŸ˜�. I plan to order QUITE a few more patterns. I'm wearing a medium by the way.


Dress is nice, just don't look too closely at the seams the fabric doesn't line up and the markings on the edge of the fabric bolt is visible. Fit is good. Fabric is a heavier weight than I expected for the price which was a nice surprise. Belt broke trying to get it out of the plastic wrapping. I bought a larger belt which worked great you can see it in the picture. I'm a 38DDD and the top fit very well. Overall pleased for the price.


I purchased this from Grace Karin (fulfilled through Amazon) based on the measurements in their size chart and it was way way waaaay too big. I like to sew myself and actually know my own measurements.


I have submitted for a return/refund.


Other than the size issue, the dress was beautiful and well-made. I just wish I wasn't swimming in it.


Very pretty dress. I received a lot of compliments when I wore this dress. The label says to hand wash cold, but I think that dry cleaning would be best because the colors are rich and dark. It fits nicely. I am 4'11" tall 113  pounds and I ordered  this dress in a small.  I plan to purchase more in different colors. this dress is very dainty and ladylike. It can be worn on various occasions.


I washed it gently in cold water but the colors ran horribly the first time I washed it and I am unable to wear it now because it looks so awful. Unfortunately I missed the short return window and am stuck with this Dali-painted dress. The cut and fit were alright and I had been looking forward to wearing it.


The photos of the Floral 33 dress make it look blue (on several different screens) but it is very much green. It is a beautiful dress none the less. (Indoor and out door photos attached)


I have purchased two of these dresses in different patterns, a M for me 5â€™-6â€�, 145#, 32DD and an XS for the daughter 5â€™-2â€�, 105#, 31A and they both fit true to size.


The construction is great, no sewing issues even the bottom of the zipper is covered with ribbon so it doesnâ€™t scratch.


I can't deny it's a gorgeous dress.... But it's not worth the money... Maybe $10 less.... I'm usually a XXL and decided to go for that size.... This looks like a L, not even an XL....Much rather go spend more money for something better....


First of all let me say this dress fit WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED. Reason being is I am a busty gal. I wear a 44 H in a bra and let me tell you finding a dress to accomedate never happens!! I got a 4x thinking well I am gonna have to get a huge size for my bust and hips...NOPE!! OMG. First time ever I am glad to say something didnt fit I went down a size it fit perfectly!! The colors were vibrant,the material superb witb superior quality and the stitch work was the best I have seen in a long time especially for us larger gals. Sometimes I feel like at this size you get black beige or moomoo dresses!! I rarely get to go out and the day of my husbands graduation I had them gagging on my eleganza!!!( its a RUPaul refferance) I totally strutted and looked fabulous. I did return the other dress but I am going to use the money and buy another dress lol!! I felt gorgeous,alive and like my old self. For once I was the hot wife,not the wife who has a auto immune disease with no cure. I felt alive and my dress made mom dad tear up a little. The man never cries. Grace Karen thank you for making my day. I will post pic soon!! Xoxoxo ğŸ‘—â�¤ğŸŒ¹ğŸ’›ğŸ‘šğŸ’™ğŸ¥€ğŸ’šğŸŒ»ğŸ’œğŸŒ¼ much love - Lupus Bomb shell!! PS I wish you had a refferal program ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�
