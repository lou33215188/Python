I love this dress! It fits perfectly! I thought it came with abetted slip but it doesnâ€™t. Even so, I have gotten so many compliments and I just barely put it on today.


I love it, perfect with a crinoline to attend a spring wedding. I'm a big girl and this dress makes me feel pretty.


Great dress for any occasion. Received lots of compliments.


My daughter looks beautiful in this dress.  Fit well and she feels beautiful.  Also modest which I like.


I got so many compliments on this dress, and it was super comfortable. The belt fit me fine- I am 5''4", 140lbs, 34B, wear a size 6 pants, and the medium fit me well! I think I need this in the black!


I love, love this dress. I'm plus sized, and very tall, so have a hard time finding flattering clothes, especially when buying online. At 5'9, this dress still hits me slightly above knee, even after adding a petticoat. Will be buying in more colors, for sure. Do use the sizing guide in the photos though! I needed a different size than I would have otherwise purchased


Pretty, but a little too tight around my bust/back.  I returned it.


Ordered for my daughter and she loves it. Follow sellers measurement guide for a great fit.


It was to large on the should and chest area... I really loved it ,,, a smaller would not work for the rest of my body..


I was excited to get my dress. I never got to try it on.  After I opened the package, I noticed the zipper handle was broken, the zipper was misaligned and the zipper was coming out of the fabric. I am very disappointed.
