GRACE KARIN for making effort designing beautiful dress like this one .


Love this dress. I'm a 18-20 bottom, but I have a smaller chest. I bought the 1x and it fit perfectly. It's beautiful. I got the black with colorful flowers print. I already on a couple Petty coats and will wear it with this. Great purchase.


The dress fit my daughter perfectly. She is a size 2 so we purchased the extra small. This item was perfect for the 50s themed dance. I would recommend purchasing the skirt to go under the dress for the full effect.


Great quality! Loved this dress fir like a glove and is super cute! The belt is kind of crappy, but that really isnâ€™t a problem at all, plenty of belts in the world you can use instead of the one it comes with. Definitely would buy againğŸ‘�ğŸ�½ Just wish it came with pockets!!â˜¹ï¸�


I like this dress quite a bit. It is made well, and the colors are beautiful. my only complaint is the arms are cut very small. I have really skinny arms and it is still very tight in my arm pits. I am going to have to get it tailored to open the arm holes a little wider but with the price and quality of the dress I'm not too upset by that.


Absolutely gorgeous. The colour is vibrant and crisp, the material is excellent quality and the pattern is true to the picture. I absolutely love this dress and will most definitely be purchasing more from this company!!


I love my vintage swing party dresses.  I have bought 5 this summer.  I wear a 12 in dresses and bought L/XL.  The L gives a snug fit and XL less snug.  Knee length and always get a complement when I wear them :)


Dress looked very cute! The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was that the size was too small in some areas but too big in others. I ended up returning mine but plan to purchase another one in a size up in the future. However, the design I like is out of stock in my size I need so I will be waiting until it is available.


Absolutely adorable and very flattering! Through no fault of the company, I was sad to have to return it because i have a 5 month old and wasn't thinking about it being breastfeeding friendly and wouldn't be able to wear it anywhere for a while. However, I will definitely be buying another one whenever I am done!!
