I went with my instinct to buy a medium size dress, despite the measurements listed with the product. My waist size is 30 inches - the medium dress supposedly is 28-29, but it's even loose on me with my waist size. I do love the dress and would recommend. Just be aware it runs a little bigger than stated.


The dress is fine but it came with TWO significantly large hole in the middle of the dress and on noth sides, unfortunately I do not have time to return it so I'm gonna add some white bows and try to cover it ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


I bought the size that fit my waist thinking it would fit everywhere evenly...not so. The chest area is way too small. Very disappointing because I loved the dress. Unless you have a small chest the dress isn't going to fit.


love this dress.  I wore it to work and out to dinner.  I could not believe the complements.  Ordering another one or two.  The dress came in one day that's a plus!!!  I ma 5'2 and about 170 lbs ordered a XL fits great


This is seriously the perfect dress. Itâ€™s gorgeous and is a classic look. Iâ€™m ordering another pattern, itâ€™s amazing!


Excellent


What a beautiful dress.  Loved it in the picture and put it on and it was just as amazing!  Can't wait to wear it this weekend to my best friends Bridal Shower.  I am Matron of Honor.  Would have loved if it was still available in the light blue, but the black is just as beautiful.


beautiful dress. i am so happy


It is so absolutely adorable and fit perfectly! I love it! What a value for the price!


My daughter needed a vintage dress for a dance production. She is a little over 5'4" and weighs 102#.  We ordered XS and it fit her perfectly!  It worked well for the production and she plans to wear it at other times, too.  Be aware this dress does need to be dry cleaned - we haven't done this yet, but will update review if any issues. Otherwise, very pleased!
