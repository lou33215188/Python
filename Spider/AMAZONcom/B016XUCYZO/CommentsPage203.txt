GREAT fit, everyone loved it AND I would wear it everyday if i can.  The fit was perfect, usually a size 10 and a small bust size .... it was just right.


Absolutely gorgeous dress on my wife. The price for such high quality, beautiful work is unbeatable.


Just a teeny but on the small side. It works... but would have liked a tad bit more room


Really tight around the midsection.  Not made for very "busty" women.  Fantastic fabric and quality.


Daughter loved this dress. Fit her to a T. Excellent buy.


I was so pleased with this item.  It was adorable on.  Great for a slim body type.  My grand daughter loved the full skirt.


Everyone loved this dress.


Fits my wife good, she likes it.....


I like the dress but you can see through it so wear proper undergarments and the belt is cheap so it broke already and i only had it on for the morning before it broke


good goods, fast delivery, good price
