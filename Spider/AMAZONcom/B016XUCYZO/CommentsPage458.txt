Hi,


 Grace karin gave me the exact fit I was looking for, I am a 140 - 160, but the XL fit perfect.


Thanks


this look big even though it fits on the top area


Absolutely love this dress!  The fabric is beautiful and I easily ironed it the night it arrived.  Very flattering!


The dress is very beautiful and the fabric is good but it didn't come with the belt was shown in the picture.


Beautiful dress. Fits well and as expected.


Fits nice. Lands  right at my knees. Very happy!


Got so many compliments on this dress. Not very thick material, but I only needed it for a party so it did what I needed it to do.


Great bargain. Nice quality, good fit. Simple, classic style.


This dress is very flattering. You can dress it up or keep it casual.


Pretty dress. I bought a medium. It is somewhat tight in the top area. Plenty of room in the skirt. I think a large would be too big.
