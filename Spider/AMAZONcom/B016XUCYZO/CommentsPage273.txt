This dress was perfect for a bridal shower tea I hosted. I was sort of between sizes and initially ordered a 2x but it was a little too big. The 1x was great. Much better quality than I imagined. I loved it - especially with the petticoat.


Nice!


Fits great. The top section by the neck seems to be a little big, but nothing that cannot be fixed. Wore with a petticoat and had many complements. What a great buy!


Adorable dress!


Great quality with an amazing swishy bottom. However, the underarms were too tight for me. I'm 5'2" and weigh 110, wear 32A, but my shoulders tend to be broader than your typical petite person, so I could see how it could fit someone who has no problem wearing a size small t-shirt.


Love the style of this dress, it beautiful I bought a bolero jacke to go with it and the combo goes beatifully


It's a lovely dress and it fits, only a trifel snug. The belt was definitely too small.


this is horrid


I LOVE this dress! I ordered XS as I am 5ft 1inch 110 lbs. I am going to buy a few more of these dresses! I have the hardest time finding a dress that fits me as I am small busted and the chest fits perfectly on this dress.


I am so I love with this dress!!! I measured at a 3x but ordered a 2 and 3x to see which may fit better and the 2x was perfect!! Definitely add a petticoat to give that extra volume (which I am wearing one in the picture)!!
