Super cute pattern, but the belt is way off on size and it looked cheap so I returned it.


Absolutely loved this dress! Great material, thick yet still cool. Received many compliments. I changed the belt and one con is that it's hard to get all the wrinkles out but it's still a show stopper!


I ordered a size up since I have a large bust. It fit, but since I'm 5'0" it was somewhat long on me.


Gorgeous dress.  Very flattering to girls with heavy bottoms as it covers nicely.  Super feminine!


Very cool dress except it appears to be made for an extremely short-waisted person...  the waist hit about 3 inches below my chest (and I fully understand retro sizing).  I returned.


order a size larger than you normally wear and it will fit perfect!  Looks much better when worn with a petty coat.


I bought a small, weigh 145lbd and I am 5â€™1. I also bought the under piece which I think completed the look.


Pretty, belt is skimpy...


I was a little unsure about size but medium fit perfect. The fabric was high quality nice heavy fabric. I received many compliments on this dress I wore with a petticoat underneath and that really made it pop


The style made me feel much larger than I am.
