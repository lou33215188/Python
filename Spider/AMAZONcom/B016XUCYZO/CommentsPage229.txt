LOVELY dress. Wore it to Havana, got lots of compliments on it. Fits perfectly. I’m 5’9” 34C-26-37


I LOVE this dress! It is beautiful and flattering


Great dress! For the price, it was made well and looks very cute! Have received many compliments on it.


Loved this dress! Nice fit.


Very cute. A little high waisted for me. I am 5'9" and normally wear a 4. I will keep it and adjust the belt.


Dress was lovely but a bit tight.  Unfortunately, had to return.


I originally ordered the dress 2 sizes too small but after a great exchange with the store/Amazon and the return of the original dress. I measured correctly and ordered the correct size. Plus, it was delivered quicker than expected so I'm very happy with the outcome.


Love these dresses- people always compliment me when I wear them.


The dress is great quality. I am a pretty strict size 6 -'I ordered the Medium. The armpits and chest were tight on me (I am not busty). It was pretty uncomfortable by the end of the night but I got tons of compliments. I would size up!


I am usually a size 8 and medium fit perfectly. I have a long torso and this dress fits me as an empire dress. Great value for the price.
