Super cute.  Well made.  The belt is cheap.  I'm replacing it.  Also, there are no belt loops to keep the belt in place. Really cut with petticoat.


I had to alter this on a bit as the top was too big, but I really enjoy wearing it .  People stopped me in stores to compliment it.


I had to return it Sized too small and I looked like June Cleaver from Leave it to Beaver


super cute on


This dress looks and feels wonderful. I wore it to mother's day brunch and got a ton of complements. It's fabulous.


Always lower my expectations when ordering clothes without trying them on...was delightfully happy when this dress arrived and fit exactly to measurements, do not order by size you will be disappointed.  Material is better than anticipated and with the petticoat underneath it is adorable, though could be worn without and be perfectly fine too.  I just ordered two more in different patterns.


Beautiful dress but too small.


I will be buying this in several other colors! Fabric is thick and the dress is beautiful. I am wearing this for my marriage ceremony with an crinoline underskirt. It is a tad snug, but if I lost a couple of lbs it would be perfect! Nice length too..and the fabric belt isn't too bad. Pretty dress, and I am so happy I got it!!


I bought on a whim; why not try the #1 bestselling dress?  You ladies are ON to something; the compliments just did not stop.  I wore this to Disneyland, and fit in *perfectly* at California Adventure.  Loved it so much, I've bought one in black for ordinary dress-up.  This wasn't too costume-y, it was simply a lovely dress at an amazing price that flattered my figure.


Super cute dress, runs a bit small but the fabric seems fairly high quality. The little belt is cute, too!
