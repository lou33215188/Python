Love the dress, ditched the belt that comes with it. It was cheap and thin, and unfortunately this dress, with me being a normal-size-torso owner, hits a little too high (and makes me look pregnant from the side). The easy workaround for me was to just pair the dress with a thicker belt (at least 2") and line the top of the belt up with the "waist" seam. Wish it was perfect on its own, but for me, it required some tweaks.


Love the thicker fabric, love the pattern, love the price. Cant complain too much :)


I honestly couldn't wait for the mail to run today!!!! This dress is PERFECT in every way possible!!!! I absolutely LOVE it!!!!! I bought it to wear at my daughter's wedding, but will soon be ordering more in various colors/prints! The fabric is thick and the dress is very well made! This is the first item of clothing I've ever ordered without first trying it on, & I couldn't be happier! I even posted it on Facebook for all my friends! I'm going to order the petit coat just in case I want it to be more full, but it's perfect even without it! I love this dress!!!!


Pardon the terrible pictures...I couldn't wait to try it on, even though I had just gotten out of the pool!!! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ™ˆ


I bought this for a wedding, I didn't read the reviews that said order a size up and I was nervous even when I took it out it looked small...then I tried it on and it fit me perfectly.  The material is a thicker cotton and feels a lot more expensive than what they are selling it for.  The lemons look exactly as pictured.  I lost a lot of weight and wanted to cry when I put it on I felt pretty again. <3 I'm buying more!!!


I'm 5'5, 160lbs, Size 12 and 38C/D bust and I ordered the Large.


I absolutely LOVED this dress! Usually the 'fit and flare' or skater style do not flatter my shape (somewhat pear shaped) but THIS. DRESS. THOUGH! It's been a long time since I have felt this confident about myself in a dress. I am 5'2" and weigh about 215lbs, a 38C and wear an XL/XXL or a 0X/1X in plus top and a 14W/16W or 18 jeans - all depending on the brand.


I ordered the XXL based on the many berry helpful reviews. I probably could have ordered an XL and would have been ok but there most likely would have been those horizontal boob pucker things in the dress fabric. And while we are talking about fabric.... this felt amazing! I felt like I had bought a $150 dress from Macy's! It has a beautiful semi sheen to it and just the right amount of stretch. I'm not a fan of the 'dressmaker' style zipper because I can never get them zipped (while the dress is on) on my own. It would be nice if there was a different style zipper but that probably would have taken away from the luxurious look and feel of the dress.


The dress length hit maybe an inch or two below my knees, just enough so it didn't make me look short and squatty. I will definitely order another of these dresses!


Oh and on a final and probably not such a big deal note, the packaging the dress came in was a nice touch. You can tell the manufacturer/designer really cares about the little details. It wasn't your run of the mill crispy cellophane type of package. It was actually a nice soft flexible ZIPLOC style package with the designers logo printed on the outside. Probably irrelevant to the overall experience of the dress itself, but still all in the details!


Fits ok but fabric stinks and the print on the back was missing!!!! Literally was like the printer just ran out of ink.  I am afraid to wash it because I feel like the ink will just come right off. Bought these for mommy daughter matching and my dress is no good. Fits true to size but go for a solid dress if you must.


GREAT dress.  My daughter saw this dress on Buzzfeed, found it here, and sent me a link, asking for it for her 14th birthday.  She never likes how things fit, thinks everything is uncomfortable, and is just extremely picky.  Well, she LOVED this and threw it on immediately for her party.  It is SUPER flattering and, she thought, very comfortable.  She got compliments on it from literally everyone who came to her party--adults, kids, men, women.  I want to order several more in different prints for both her and our other daughter.


FYI, she's about 120, 5'4"ish and we got a small.  I might go with a M for next time, just to allow room to grow due to her age, but it fits *perfectly* right now.


I'm returning this dress.  I admit I'm a bit hard to find clothes for.  I never really thought so, but apparently I have a bizarre shape.  I got this item in a large.  I'm an hourglass shape (39ish (36D)-30-38), and I was not at all pleased with the fit.  Even without zipping it all the way up (about an inch from the top), but dress was very tight in the chest and shoulders, and showed every bit of back fat.  At the same time, the waist was loose.  No just 'not tight' but loose.  Between the high waist and the tight chest, this dress took away all of my curves and made me look like a big lump. It's a shame because it's a very cute dress, but it's just not for me.


This dress is amazing. I was impressed by the quality at such an affordable price. I wore this dress with a petticoat underneath and it was perfect for a ladies tea party. I got SO many compliments! I'll be buying the other colors and styles now.


I'm 6'2" and usually wear a size 10 pants and a small/medium in shirt size as long as the dirt doesn't have sleeves. I ordered a size medium and needed to wear a pushup bra to have the top fit properly. I also added a black petticoat/skirt underneath to add to the flare of the dress.


This dress is SO cute on! My daughter needed a vintage style dress for a valentine's performance and this worked out great! I followed the measurements given by the company and it was perfect. She wore it with "dressystar women's 50's vintage petticoat" in black to have a nice full dress. She is not a girly girl and doesn't really prefer to wear dresses, but she has willingly worn this multiple times, and even Disney-Bound (wearing an outfit similar to or inspired by a Disney Character for those of you whom aren't familiar with Disney Bounding :) ) as the Queen of Hearts when she went to Epcot and Magic Kingdom; and got according to her "SOOOO many compliments" lol. She wants to order another one in blue to go as Belle next time. The dress is super cute and flattering. The Fabric is nice and it seems to be well constructed. I did wash it in the washing machine and hung it to dry. It was a bit wrinkled but they ironed right out and the dress looked as good as new. Definitely recommend this dress!
