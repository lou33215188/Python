Such a good buy. Pretty fabric, reasonable price, lovely style.


The product descriptions says "Red," but the photo looks more plum. It is actually pretty red, but the fit is good and it is a flattering dress.


I wore this to a mommy and me tea party and it was PERFECT!!! We were definitely the best dressed! My daughter woreÂ 


I ordered for a high tea party for Valentines Day and it was perfect...!  I would order another pattern another time and recommend to a friend.


This was a gift to our 17 year old granddaughter. She loves it. The dress fits just right so I hope it doesn't shrink when she washes it the first time. Packaging was good. The dress was not overly wrinkled. She wore it without ironing it the first time and it looked just fine.


I am 5' 7". 34-27-38. I ordered a small. It's nice and fitted. It comes to a nice knee length. Conservative, classy and feminine. These dresses are true to size for me. I keep getting compliments on the 2 dresses I ordered.


I ordered this dress as a back up in case the previous one I ordered did not fit or look right, however they both ended up being so cute and fitting just right that it made my decision really hard to choose between the two.  Beautiful


Material and color were wonderful.  The cut outs for the arms however were smaller than comfortable for me.


I seriously cannot believe the price for the quality of the dress!  It's beautiful!  I ordered the petticoat, and it's absolutely perfect!!!  Makes me look skinny too :-)


I love this dress. This dress fits better than i expected. I'm short and usually have to alter my clothing to get the correct fit,but not with this dress. I didnt even have to where a petticoat under for the flair. Would definitely recommend to buy this dress.
