Very happy with this purchase! Dress is well made and true to size.  I would definitely buy from them again!


Love it


This is a great dress.  Nice fabric and weight.  Has a bit of a sheen to it.  I bought the blue polka dot it's a sweet little dress.  Fits perfect.  I am a medium and I ordered the medium.


I will wear this to my fifties theme party.


Very nice quality and great color


Beautiful dress.. fits like a glove, but you must get a petticoat! So worth it!


Darling dress! Material is very light and thin. Suitable for the price.


The dress is absolutely beautiful, returning to re-order in a lager size.


I like everything about this dress. I bought a floral pattern. I like tea length dresses & this one is perfect for me. I am 5'. The dress fit perfect. I like the material and the dress is soft & very feminine.


I think it's very pretty. The belt didn't fit at all, far too large. The dress was slightly too big but I did order it on the larger side to be safe. You'll definitely want a petticoat to get that poofy skirt. I'm excited to wear it to my school dance!
