This is a super cute dress! Love it!


The bottom flared out nicely, but the top part wouldn't zip up and around the arms is too close


The dress was just as lovely as I expected. I love it!!!


Exactly as shown on the website


I love this dress. It's fits so perfectly


I love the fitting and I'm 100% very happy!!!


Says it is cotton and it looks and feels like a  shiny polyester ..  Doubt it is real cotton.


Love the dress, the fabric the color.  Fit is a little tighter than I would like.


Love this! It's cute and fits as expected.


My dress fit me perfect
