I purchased this dress with the hat and gloves for Bridal Shower Tea Party. I was the hit of the party! Everyone kept saying how nice my dress was. I wore it with the petticoat underneath it gave it the true 50's retro look and that's exactly what I wanted! I would give more stars â­�ï¸� if I could! GET THIS DRESS LADIES! ğŸ‘— ğŸ™ŒğŸ�¾


I loved this dress but the arm holes are too small and I fear extremely uncomfortable.  I don't know where the dress was manufactured,  but in my opinion was not true to size.  It is so disheartening  to purchase a dress that makes you feel good and not be able to wear it.  I returned the dress for refund.


The return experience was fabulous!  You print the return slip, put it on the package and one inside, take it to drop-off location and you are credited when shipment is scanned.  WONDERFUL!


To the manufacturer: Women appreciate the feeling of looking pretty in their clothing and we look for functionality because we're busy.  If you're of larger stature, why would you not adjust pattern sizes accordingly.  I ordered an XL and could barely get my arms through the arm holes.  Just my thoughts.


This dress is glamorous and nicely priced. It was a little big for me, 5'4" and a 100 lbs. I ordered an extra small and even with a petticoat it didn't fit exactly but it looks nice!


Many compliments, can't go wrong with this. I would say you have to have the petticoat it takes the dress to the next level. I would not wear this dress without it.


I love this dress! It fits perfectly, and I'm a size 22/24 in their 3X. I can't tell you how hard it is to find dresses that really flatter my body. I literally wear dresses every day. It's comfortable for me, and keeps me cool.


I've been to nearly every possible plus size retail store, and it is getting harder to find any dresses, let alone ones I like and fit well. I'm hooked on Grace Karin now!


The fabric is strong, vibrant, and washes well. I bought the blue polka dots and the pink/purple floral dresses. I'll try to put up pictures!


P.S. My bust is a 44DDD, and the top part has a little room. So if you're extra busty, it will still work. If you aren't as busty, it might not fit in a way that you feel comfortable in. Try it though!


This ended up being too small and this dress did not have a belt as advertised. I ended up returning it.


This is a really adorable little dress that fits me PERFECTLY! Extra smalls have a tendency still to be too large for me when I order from unknown sources without trying them on first, but people have commented how this dress fits me as if it was tailored to my body. Not too tight at all, but just right! I love the vintage look and quality feel. It is well constructed. As you might notice from the recommended purchases to go along with your dress, you won't achieve that true A-line flair without an underskirt (as was the norm in this style's heyday), but even without it's a gorgeous little getup. I am a 26-year-old going on 60 it often seems, so as someone born in the wrong era for fashion and music, this dress brings a little back of the mid 20th century to my wardrobe! I love it.


Was so worried it would run small , so I ordered up a size --- I was pleased it fit as well as it did -  a little loose in areas , it was also just a little short for me , I'm 5'5" , but with the cute petticoat . It looked too short , the dress was well made , nicer than I expected and I loved the packaging .  However I am returning it, I will try again , the fabric and print were lovely , but when I put it on my -- not as cute as I hoped for, but that was my mistake  --- I think I may go for a solid  dark color . Or a small polka dot next time .  If you like this type of dress --- you will love these !! Good luck and enjoy !


Perfect fit and cut! Excellent fit for an hourglass figure!


Iâ€™m 5â€�2â€™ and 135lbs, full D cup, itâ€™s a little tight in the bust area. All of my weight is distributed evenly outside of ample top. I measured myself. Thank goodness I got a medium and there is a bit of give. The neck and shoulders have more room than Iâ€™d like but thatâ€™s due to small frame and ample top for it, large wouldâ€™ve definitely been too big allover. It still looks great and no one really notice. Got 4 dresses in all and the one small I got (based on others similar weight and height ) was too tight to zip when it got to the bust area, will swap for a medium.
