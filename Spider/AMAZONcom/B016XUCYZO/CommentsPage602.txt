Fabric and pattern are nice.


I used their sizing chart and it "squished" me across the bust and the material stretched oddly.  If you have a D or larger bust, order UP a size. If you're a size A or B, the sizing chart in accurate. I DID get it in a bigger size and it fit nicely across the bust and looked very nice on.


Includes a belt.... but no belt loops to secure it.  Looks better with a ribbon belt anyway.


Pretty but it's a huge large i have to Taylor it


To small and see through


Love this dress


Nice dress


Great material, perfect fit!


It's really cute but it did not come with the belt.


Love the quality and style.  Looks great without the tutu skirt.


Adorable!


It was perfect! It fit a size 14 like a fitted glove.
