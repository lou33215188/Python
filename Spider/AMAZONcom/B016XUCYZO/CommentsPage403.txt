This dress is listed as cotton, but it's not...  The reviews say it runs big and to size up, so I did, and it's HUGE!


Wore this dress for my graduation ceremony and felt wonderful. The dress is worth its price. It is really pretty and will fetch you lots of compliments.


Cutest dress ever! Material was perfect for a great fit.


It was too large, I followed the sizing chart.


Love Love Love these dresses!! Ordered 3 different colors and plan to order more!! Great quality, sizing exact, follow instructions for measurements.

The dress is gorgeous!! But did not come with a belt like the description says. Would have really likes the belt!
