Received so many compliment! Loved the dress, loved the fit, very comfortable. I'm 5'7 195 ordered a large fit perfectly! Will definitely be ordered more colors!


I absolutely adore this dress. It's super cute. It's definitely a tad small for sizing. I normally wear an XL or an XXL if sizes run small. I decided to order an XXL to be on the safe side and it was still too small. It was really small in the chest, and difficult to zip up because of the way the zipper is styled. I would definitely order a size up if you're busty.


The dress is a beautiful color and fit great. The only issue is that the description says that the dress came with a belt and it did not have the belt with it when it arrived. I am contacting the seller to see if we can get one shipped now so we will see how that goes.


My daughter loves this dress!!!


This was my first time ordering any clothing on Amazon and I was so pleased with this dress. The quality is great as well as the fit I usually wear a size 8 or 10 and the large fit me great. It comes along with the cute little belt, I can't wait to wear it out


A nice dress--fun to sway and twirl in. :)


A very cute dress -- got several compliments on it. Can't beat it for the price. The first one I bought had a broken zipper, returned it and got an identical replacement. So the only issue is I'll keep an eye on the zipper.


i love it..i love..my mom helped me get it as my bday gift. i ordered a small...i;m 5.4 and 134lbs. it has pretty flair and the material has a little stretch.


Love love love!!! Such a gorgeous dress! Received a ton of compliments and it fit true to size. For the price you pay itâ€™s VERY worth it. Highly recommend.


Simply amazing! A little big but worked wonderfully.
