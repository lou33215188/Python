Wore this for my daughters wedding. Nice dress. Just wish companies would sell more dresses at size extra small. Very little to choose from


Beautiful! The blue is a nice, rich hue. Iâ€™m dressing it up for a summer wedding with a different belt and some sexy heels. Iâ€™m choosing to wear it without a petticoat. My style is much more simple, and the modest neckline and hem are extremely appropriate and very flattering. Iâ€™m 5â€™4â€� tall, wear a size 6 pant, and a 34a bra. The small fits perfect.


Beautiful dress! So feminine and pretty. I bought this to wear to a 50's themed formal occasion and I can't wait to wear it. The fabric is good quality, a stretchy, slightly firm cotton blend. I'm 5'5", 176 lbs, 42-32-42 and I bought Large with a petticoat. Fits like a glove!


Looks really cute on my daughter, re-ordered small the xs was too snug on top  she is 5'6" 125. great deal for the money.


I am so confused. Do I have a long torso? The waist sits high and I look like I am wearing a tent, therefore, it looks unflattering on me. I am so bummed because I live the idea of the dress. It just doesn't fit my body. I am 5"5' and 160... My body is curvy and well proportioned.


This dress is lovely, however it is shorter in length than most of the dresses of similar design.  It is perfect for a younger woman.


The dress is beautiful and we received it faster than expected.  However, we went off the size chart that is in the photos and ordered the 3X for my size 14 daughter - Wondered but figured foreign sizing.  the dress is WAY too big and she was planning to wear it the next day.


Beautiful!


That red really pops out.


I wore this to a wedding last spring and got lots of compliments.


Dress arrived as scheduled, material is of a heavy cotton, zipper however you may have to be careful very cheap, I'm 5'7  135 lbs ordered  large size, bust area a little to big, I'm adding a bolero , that covers up the excess bulk.  length a tad to short for me above the knee, I will add a Tutu under skirt to show about 2" looks very nice, I will add a red belt, red bolero, red shoes & purse. very happy with the look for the  price.


using a steamer to get wrinkles  out put a run in fabric, the material should be stronger than that, cool iron did not  get wrinkles out at all, according to the directions that should work. Didn't even get to wear
