I used the sizing chart and was on the border of M and L so I ordered the L based on my measurements. However, there is some stretch to the material and I felt like it was too big. I returned the L and purchased the M instead. It fit perfectly!


beautiful comfortable


I wouldn't have minded a little snug but I couldn't zip the dress up because my shoulders and bust were just too large and this was a 3x.


Its a little tight in the arm pit, but other than that, its a beautifully full skirted dress.


I love this dress especially for the price. I bought a size XXL and currently wear a size 16W.  I do suggest taking your measurements and checking the size chart provided to find the right fit. The only thing I feel I might need to have tailored is the collar as it doesn't rest flat once the dress is on. The material is pretty great too.


Great dress! Ordered it last minute for a Kentucky Derby party fit as expected. The fabric is what you'd expect for the price point.


Love the dress!


So elegant!


Great quality and fit perfectly!


The dress overall is absolutely stunning, I wore it to church one Sunday and people loved it! Definitely recommend getting this dress EVEN IF the chest area neck line didn't fit me so well the dress was very nicely made, not see through, and very flowly!!! Love it


I love the dress. I got an XL just to be sure it wouldn't be too snug around my rib cage. It has just enough room and the belt looks fabulous with it. Received many compliments on it today.


Really liked the patter of the dress, it seems well constructed, but runs quite large. I bought the 2x based on my bust measurements and it was far too big, so I returned for a smaller size. Waiting to see how that works out!
