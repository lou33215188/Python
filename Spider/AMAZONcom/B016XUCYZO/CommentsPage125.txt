I LOVE this dress! It's so adorable! I bought it for my university graduation and wore it with a black petticoat, and it looked darling! I get compliments every time I wear it.


I love the style of this dress and the material. It is a bit snug but it should fit well this summer when I am a few pounds lighter.


This is a great dress for the price. The shape flatters, is comfortable, and super cute! Perfect for wearing to a wedding, church, or Sunday brunch!


Perfectly modest dress.  I got a lot of compliments on it.  I didn't get the hoop skirt to wear under it and it was perfect without it.  It will be in regular rotation with my other dresses.


Amazing dress!  It is much more beautiful and better quality than I expected.  Medium fit my Size 10 daughter perfectly and she has received so many compliments on the dress.  It was purchased for a swing dance performance, but can easily be worn for any dressy occasion.  I am very pleased with this purchase.


Dress arrived in excellent condition.  Dress looks like what it does on the Amazon add.  It fit well for a medium sized frame person.  Perfect for my period costume. Material is synthetic so to wear it once and a while isn't so bad.


I am in love with this dress ğŸ‘—. After reading reviews I ordered  according to my measurements and it fits perfectly and looks perfect I love it! I also got the crinoline which adds an extra girliness to it and changed out the belt. I simply can't wait to wear it!


Absolutely love this dress, wore it to work and got Sooooo many compliments, fit is wonderful, color and fabric all wonderful, I will be ordering more of this style


In addition to the white one I also have the black with red roses. Both are gorgeous and I get so many compliments every time I  wear them. They fit EXACT, I'm a plus size girl, so if you're nervous about the size I would order one size up.


As everyone else, I wanted to look nice for my birthday. I bought this as an "amazon virgin", not knowing what to expect. I am 5'7 and about 160 lbs. My bust is a 36, waist a 31 and hips a 41. This dress fits me in all the right places and I absolutely am surprised at the quality for sure. If you wanted to wear this for church or another gathering where knee length is a key factor, i suggest you get this dress. It is a perfecttttt length and fit.
