Love this dress! I normally wear between a large and extra large so I order an extra large and it fits perfect! I love this dress!!


Fit was a little off - will need to be altered


It is totally fabulous and sooo classy


i didn't care for he fabric and I feel the sizing was way off, too small.


I love this dress!! It's very flattering and I got lots of complements! In fact, I ordered another one in a different color!


So perfect


The dress was so small I could barely get it on. The waist was very high, and the arm opening was very tight.


Super cheap nothing like the picture . Disappointed


The dress is nice and it fits as expected. Use The size chart given by the manufacturer not Amazon.


Well for starters, there was a dead spider in the bag. After cleaning that off, I tried the dress and belt on and they were both horrifyingly low quality. Absolutely not like the dress shown in the display images. Don't buy from this company, spend your money elsewhere.
