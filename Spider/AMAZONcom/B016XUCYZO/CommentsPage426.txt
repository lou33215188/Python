Absolutely amazing


I love this dress. Another one that is very fitted but has some stretch. Used the size chart. It comes in so many prints!


The main issue is the fact that the product info says it has 4% spandex, but the fabric has little to no give


True to size! Perfect fir the occasion! Quality material and sewing!


This dress is adorable! I love the silky fabric. It was a little loose around my waist but with the belt you wouldn't notice. All in all, it's a fabulous dress!


Beautiful dress. Love the fit. I am 5'6" approx 250lbs. Little close at the back


Absolutely gorgeous, bought it for my daughter for a funeral....fit like a glove, she's a 7/8 in dresses and the M fits perfect!


Not flattering on my hour glass plus size...The overall dress material is heavy and length is to long on me.  I think this would look better on a tall plus size women not short.


Love the color and quality of the dress. I'm a larger girl so I ordered a 4x. It's too big on top and I had to have it altered.


I LOVE this dress. It's cute without the petti coat, but with the petti coat it just looks more puffy. True to size.
