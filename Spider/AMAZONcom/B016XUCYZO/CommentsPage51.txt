Was excited and worried when it arrived. I ordered it for a Christmas party for work. Based off the size chart from the company I ordered a Floral 2X (40DD, 35). It was slightly large on me but not unwearable loose. Still going to keep it since I adore it so much!! I am going to bring it to an alteration store and have it altered to my body. Worth the money!!


The dress was beautiful, although it came stained with a red dot I had to return it but was able to take a picture with the item. Will be repurchasing.


HANG DRY ONLY!!!


I just shrunk mine by at least 2 sizes by putting in in my dryer on air fluff no heat. I washed it in clod but I should have hung it up to dry.


I bought it in another color and Iâ€™m afraid to wash it now ğŸ˜¢


Super bummed cuz I LOVE this dress.


Perfect fit and the fabric is better than expected. I will be buying this in more colors for sure!


I wore this is a celebrity meet and greet and many of the actors (swoonworthy ones) commented on how much they liked my dress and how they spotted me across the room, looking like a ladybug. Exactly why I purchased it. I gives you n amazing hourglass shape, is eye catching, and you feel super cute in it. One tip, ditch the skinny belt that comes with it and buy a wide one to emphasize the nipped in waist. You feel super cute immediately after putting it on. It works with or without a petticoat.


The dress is adorable!!  I originally bought for a 50s party but I think I can wear anywhere too!!  I had read a few reviews about the material being cheesy however I beg to differ!  The material is a thicker cotton and feels heavier than a T-shirt. The belt is rather long with extra extra holes so there should be no problems there except for figuring out what to do with the excess belt. I actually just tucked it in on the side and it looks fine, the excess blends in with the dress. The size is perfect!  I wear a size 8 pant so I was nervous to see how much I need to starve myself to fit in it, haha! I am happy to announce I can eat for the next 2 weeks before my party!  Actually, I have about a 1/2 inch to spare around the waist. The bust fit fine as well, I am a 36 C and have plenty of room if I was a bra size larger too. I contemplated buying a petti-coat for poof but honestly, I can do without. The petti-coat would add to the 50s look but not needed, the poof is there. Overall, I am excited about this purchase and I feel it will be a hit at the 50s party!


I'm usually anywhere from a 4-8 so I originally ordered a medium and it was too large for me. I returned it and ordered a small and it looks great. For reference, I'm about 5'5", 130lbs.


The dress is beautiful, made of quality material, its eye catching pattern has brilliant vibrant colors. I'm 5'7, 130lb 35.5 bust and ordered the medium. It fits very nicely, not tight at all, in fact, if I wanted it tight, I would get a small. But I find the fit flattering and comfortable and am very happy with how it looks. I ordered the petticoat to go underneath in a size medium, I should have gotten a small so it would fit more snuggly. I love this dress, it is a keeper!


I bought it for a wedding I was attending and what a great choice I made!  I was going for the 1940-50s look.  Got victory curls and bright red lipstick on.  The dress with the petticoat was beautiful! Got so many complements on it.  Also, I spilled a glass of red wine at the end of the night...soaked the dress in some shout the next day and it all came out!  I was very worried about the black flowers, but nothing got discoloured!  I'm so happy, I already decided to get more dresses, different colours.  I still can't believe I got such beautiful dress, the look and fabric quality for$29.99!!!!!! Unbelievable!


Gorgeous dress - great boat neck fit - material wrinkles easily but it is not noticeable with the print - material is slightly stretchy and has a good weight to it - comes with belt - needs to be irons first wear - would look even more AMAZING with a petticoat! Based on their measurements I should have gotten a 3XL so I did - it was HUGE. Based on my current "normal" size I am a L or XL - the XL was a little bit tight so I opted to size up 1. Free returns make this a great dress to try in multiple sizes if you're in doubt. My general opinion is that I will order this brand again and I will likely size up 1 from my normal wear.


I went by the dress sizing chart not Amazon's sizing chart and it pretty much fit true to size.  My bust is 36" and waist 28". I ordered a large because I knew I could get the waist altered which is exactly what I'm going to need to do.  The fabric is high quality but the belt is very cheap.  I'm just going to use one of my own belts.  The dress comes to the top of my knees and I'm 5'8" so that is perfect.  I'm definitely going to order more of these dresses.  Worth every cent!  Classy all the way around.
