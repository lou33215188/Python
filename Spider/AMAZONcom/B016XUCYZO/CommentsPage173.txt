Material not as stretchy as I thought it would be but it fits as expected.


I wanted to love this dress, but it doesn't fit well. Too big in the neck-it gaps open. Big in the waist. But so cute when you spin. I'm returning it.


This dress is amazing. I received tons of compliments on it. It's very simple, with no liner, but the fabric is sturdy, beautiful, and the cut is perfect. It's approximately knee length, and fit a tiny bit bigger than I thought it would  (per the size chart), but I just wear it with a thick belt and it's fine. Definitely great for the money!


It fits but after a while the armholes tend to chafe.


It is mostly a beautiful dress. The skirt starts to flare out a little high adding extra fabric in the belly area that makes me look a bit pregnant. Many reviews said it ran small but I disagree. It's almost a bit large and it has some stretch to it. I'm 4'11" 125 lbs. and the small fits well.


I absolutely love this dress. Its thick material and fits perfectly, however... the belt included was like 5 sizes too big. You would think they would either have a mire adjustable belt or have them coordinate the size of belt with the dress?


Dress did not fit...all my clothes are XXL in size, same as the dress and fit well.  Don't know if I received an item that was not labeled correctly...had to return the dress.  I really really liked it.


NICE DRESS BUT MATERIAL IS VERY THIN AND THE SIZING MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT. OVERALL VERY NICE DRESS.


This dress is GORGEOUS! It has a lovely vintage look and it's the right price!


I really like these dresses I bought 2. I wear 8-10 in dresses so I ordered a XL it has just a little extra space. Love them
