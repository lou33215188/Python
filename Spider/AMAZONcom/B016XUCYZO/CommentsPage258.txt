Adorable and fits well, nice study fabric


Adorable!! The dress came with the belt, and both fit like a glove! I haven't worn it out yet, but I have tried it on -- the zipper is really delicate, so just be mindful of that while zipping into it. Better yet, have someone zip you up if you can, to avoid damaging it! Otherwise, it's great!


Quality construction, nicely styled - great fit! Fun and fresh pattern. Wearing it to a proper tea party!


A little tight around the girls and under arms.  But looks good.


This retro dress is just as cute as you think it will be. I am 5'8" and 130ish pounds. I typically wear a size 6, and 36B cup. I ordered both a small and a medium. I'm keeping the small. It is a bit snug around the armholes but not bad. The medium is too big in the bust for me, and too long for the tutu to show. The shoes are Sam Edelman's off of Zappos. Perfect spring dress for Easter and upcoming graduations.


I'm very happy with the fit and form of this dress.  I bought it on Prime Day, and so I feel I got a real bargain.  So pretty, and feels nice on.


We bought this dress for my daughter's Winter Frolic dance and it was absolutely PERFECT! We also ordered the Retro Dress Rockabilly Petticoat. We love it. She couldn't stop twirling!


I love these dresses I have 7 of them. So comfortable and made well perfect after years of wear and washes.


bought this for my mom for a 50's party she looked adorable with this and the white petticoat under
