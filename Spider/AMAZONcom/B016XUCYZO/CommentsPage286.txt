good


Omg. Didn't know what to expect but it fits and I love it. I'm plus size so it's always a gamble buying online and i've definitely hit the jackpot. Just placed an order for another dress and I will probably buy more after that. Yay!


So Cute! I love it!! Good material and fits snug on top (in a good way) I got many compliments:)


Love this dress!  The dress has a little stretch in it and the colors are vibrant.  I bought the kremlin slip to wear under it for the drama.  I plan to wear it Sunday but i have tried it on twice already.  I wear a 14-16 and the XL fits good with wiggle room. You will need to give it a good starching.


Love!!!!!


Much larger than expected.


Was a hit at my church


This was gifted to someone and it's loved. I was told that it fits well.


Beautiful dress. I've had it for several months now with no signs of wear and tear. The fabric is stuff enough to provide volume in the skirt even without a petticoat. Would definitely repurchase.


I love this dress!!! Beautiful and fits very well! Very flattering! Iâ€™m thinking about buying others in different colors.


The only thing that would make it perfect is if it had pockets!
