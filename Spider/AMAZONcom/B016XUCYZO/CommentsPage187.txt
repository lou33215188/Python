Love the style and print. Super cute with crinoline.


got for my daughter, she loves it! already added more to her list!


This dress is amazing! It fits great, is the perfect length, and is very flattering! I'm 5'11" and it hits about mid-knee. I seriously couldn't be happier--especially with this price!


The most amazing dress! It fits perfectly and looks great with or without a petty coat. Every time I wear this dress I get so many complements. I have worn this to work, as well birthday parties and the theater.


Such a great buy!  I originally ordered a large to be safe but it was true to size so I actually returned it and got a medium it fit perfect I wore t to a fancy event and got tons of compliments on it !


Again, for the price this was a great buy! I actually got many compliments on it. Quality fabric. Bought for a 50s themed shower.


I loved this dress! I'm 5'5 and it fell to my knees. It was perfect. It was a little tight around the holes for the arms. So after wearing it for like 9 hours. My armpits were a little sore. But otherwise it fit perfectly.


This dress is beautiful. I have another from Grace Karen that I adore so much I decided to get another in a different color and I am glad I did. High quality materials and made incredibly well. Received it in less than a week and am incredibly pleased with their service. Would recommend highly.


Absolutely beautiful dress. Second one that I bought for the girlfriend. Both fit perfectly and look amazing!


Beautiful dress and a flattering cut for many body types. Great dress for work or paired with a crinoline for dressier event. Did take away a star as it definitely is not 'wash and wear' and requires pressing, which given the quantity of fabric is a lengthy process. On the whole, though, I'm very pleased with this purchase.
