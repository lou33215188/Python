Very well made and fits great! Don't forget the petticoat it makes the dress even better!!!


Fits perfect!  Love it!


Ran a little small, but still fit nicely


Better quality and fit than I expected.


Beautiful dress!


This dress is an empire waist style which can be very unflattering on those of us who aren't stick skinny!  It's a cute dress, and I wish it fit, but the waistband is just too high and makes it look like a maternity dress on me.


So cute and comfortable.


I LOVE IT!!!!!!!


Love love love!!!


The dress was nice.
