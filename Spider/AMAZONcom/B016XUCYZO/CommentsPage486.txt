LOVE IT! looks great, fits well. Get the petticoat underslip, really makes the dress look nice


The dress was beautiful. I did rush shipping and it did arive on time but was missing the belt.


The sizing chart was very accurate with the measurements. Needed a larger size than usual but fit fine.


Had a Fifties Family  reunion. Husband & I won 1st place.


looks great on my daughter.


Ordered exactly my size & it was too small but wonderful dress!


Wore it as costume as Lucille Ball, but will be great to just wear.  Fabric is really nice.  Washed and hang dryed.


Super cute and fits perfectly, wish I bought more


I typically wear a size 10 and this dress fit perfectly! The fit is great and I could see staying comfortable in it all day!


Everyone absolutely loved the dress; it was so different. But it has to be worn with the tu tu slip to get the retro flared look.
