I sadly didnâ€™t try it on earlier... it fits in the bodice but the skirt is way too big.... so I cannot wear it or return it.... but it truly is adorable....


Bought it for my girlfriend to wear while she baked me a cake as I relaxed in the living room and read the paper, but she got mad and threatened to murder me. Good quality. Don't forget the petticoat.


After reading reviews, I bought an XL (I'm a 38DD) and it fit perfectly. I got so many compliments the first time I wore it. I love it and I'm definitely going to get a few more colors.


Beautiful pattern and material.  It runs somewhat smaller and a tad short waisted.  It really is lovely.


Simply put this dress is terrific.  Very comfortable and flattering for a plus size woman.


This dress looks absolutely amazing on! If you're high waisted, you'll love it. The flared skirt - I bought the crinolines - gives the illusion of a tiny waist and hides any "extra" curves from behind. I'm buying another one right away.


Very beautiful dress, true to size and good material!


The torso was extremely short. The waist fell below my Chest instead  of my waist. Had to return it.


I ordered an XL based on the size chart and it fit nicely


The only thing was that the belt it came with broke but I think that was my fault


I found the material to be very stiff and the dress didn't lay nicely. I really liked the design, I wish the material was better.
