This dress was way to small even as an XL size. I guess i should have gotten a 2or3 x. And i wear a large or xl in most dress sizes.


Color is darker than expected and skirt does not as flare as expected. I purchased a tulle slip for under the dress and still does not flare like the picture shown. It is nice however and for the price it is a nice dress.


Love, love, LOVE this dress!  It's so light for hot days and the fit is amazing!


Sime what large, but I love it


The material of the dress felt like a shower curtain. Awful, awful,awful. Don't waste your money on this dress.


Best dress ever.  Great quality.  I wear a medium and ordered a large.  Fits great.


This dress is as shown in the picture.The fabric is quiet polished one which can be a party wear also.It was neatly gift wrapped.Its It's worth the cost.I liked it


Very good quality, I am usually a medium but ordered a large just in case. I think a M would have been better, but that was my fault of course. I would say to go with your usual dress size when you order.


Beautiful dress!
