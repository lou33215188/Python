It's smaller than I expected.  Pretty material but overall not that happy with it.


LOVE this dress!!! I am 5'7.. 138 pounds.. I ordered a large because of bust size! I paired with with a pink belt, which tightens the waist for me!


I am 5'4 and about 115 lbs. I bought the blue floral version in a small and I love it. It it comfortable, it has nice material, and it fits really well. I recommend this dress.


My daughter love it!


I got so many compliments with this dress when I wore it to a friend's wedding! The waist was a little large for me (I ordered a medium), but I prefer that to it being too tight.


I like this dress the material  is not stretch


 It is cotton. But it fits and feel good


Really pretty, too big. It's a little stretchy. It gathers lint really bad. Thick fabric.


If you follow the size chart, it will fit spot-on. Nice material, very happy with purchase.


It's a lovely dress. It ran a little large and is a smidge see-through so it has to be warn with a slip.


Got so many compliments when I wore this dress.  Everywhere I went someone wanted to know where I got it or where I had it made.  It fits perfectly and is so flattering on the figure.
