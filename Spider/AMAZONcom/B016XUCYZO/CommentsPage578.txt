Simply beautiful. My daughter wore it for Easter and everyone asked me where did I buy it.  We did buy a petticoat too.


Pretty!


This is a great dress. Flattering for all body types. I'm a size 2/4. My clothing purchases are usually in size small, but I read the reviews here and and chose a medium size instead. It was a great fit. I'm 5'0 and around 130 pounds.


The dress was a bit wrinkled as soon as I opened it, but I steamed some of the wrinkles out. Overall though, this dress is a lovely buy. I'd probably recommend getting a thicker belt than the one included, but that's for my own aesthetic preferences.


These dresses are adorable but run small in the bust and are too high waisted.


This Dress is gorgeous!!! I am excited to wear it and will post again with it on at the Tea Party Brunch.


It's cute but a little rough.


Great dress.  Fits a little small.  I would suggest ordering one size up.  I will order again.


Im so cute when I wear this dress


If you have big boobs order a size up


Love it! Amazing quality and great fit
