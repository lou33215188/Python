But if you are wider at the bottom this dress mighy not fit as expected. Bummer (me) being a big girl:(


I was looking for something modest khall appropriate but also had a vintage look and im glad i came across this dress Very nice dress, love the material felt very nice, Very Well made. Look just like the pictures this is my second dress I've bought will be purchasing more.


My honest review. If i cant give 10 star to this dress, I would. This dress is so pretty! I love the way it fits on me! i got the medium size and a lot of people compliment my dress! I have the black one, i'm going to order more soon!


One of my favorite dress!! <3


Loved this dress on my granddaughter.  The fit was good.  The dress appears to be well made.  So far so good.


Georgous...love it so many compliments


Love it! I thought the dress was cute enough, but when I wore it out I got A TON of compliments. Great dress!


I was so excited about this dress I tried it on as soon as it came lol. It's ever so slightly roomy in the bust area but if I had ordered a size down I would probably have had to squeeze into it (my measurements are 51 bust, 43 waist, 55 hips and I ordered a 3x).  Very pretty pattern and flattering shape. Definitely planning to order again in more colors!


Worked wonderfully for my brother's wedding! I could have probably gone with a Large, but the XL wasn't big enough that it was a problem. The boat-neckline was a little gappy. I did not use the belt provided because it was too small, and not the look I was going for.


All good; fits as expected.


I thought this dress was really cute. I ordered it in black and as soon as I put it on, it gave me an Audrey Hepburn vibe, super cute. Dress came with a small belt but the belt was too large for me (waist: 26in/66cm), so I ended up using my own black belt. I'm 5'1 and ordered an X-small, dress came below the knees but nothing too long, looked super cute with heels.
