Shrinks in dryer, the bust is a little small to start out with then it gets even tighter after you wash it.  So, order a size to big, good material so it will hold up in the washer and dryer.


This is a very easy wearing dress, so comfy and chic. Great for adding accessories if you choose the black. I purchased the 2x and normally wear 18/20.


This dress is amazing. It's beautiful and comfortable and just perfect. I'll be ordering it in every color/pattern. I got constant compliments. I'm planning on making sure every man I've ever dated sees me in this dress. I switched out the belt that came with it for a white sash because summer, but in a few weeks, I'll use the belt.


Dress fits great, I'm a size 0-2 and the XS fit well. It does wrinkle very easily but is very easy to iron out. The fabric feels cheap but is not itchy on the skin. Looks great with and without the tulle.


The cons: the fabric is somewhat hard to iron and lint/pet hair gets easily stuck to it. The pros: the fabric is structured but soft, slightly stretchy which adds for a perfect fit, the design is classy and flattering and it's incredibly well made. The seams are neat and not bulky. True to size. The dress can be worn with or witout the belt, and can be easily dressed up or down depending on the accessories you wear with it. I would buy all the other colors available.


So cute, I love it. fits perfectly and is true to size,we got  many complied with these beautiful dressesğ—�µğ—�´ğ—�¶ğ—�·


I absolutely love this dress, I bought a petticoat to go hnderneath it and I wore it to my college audition at Oakland University on Saturday. I wish it was just a wee bit tighter on the waist, but other than that. PERFECT.


I sized up since I'm busty but even 2x was too tight on top (38DD). The rest of the dress fit perfectly. Because it pulls at the bust it makes the arms uncomfortable. I'm hoping it will give a bit over time because other than that it's wonderful and great for pairing with a petticoat.


I enjoy this dress. I'm 5'7 155lbs and ordered a medium and it fits perfect. I also bought a petti coat to go under it. Here are pictures of one with and without the petti coat


Beautiful dress! I love it... Perfect fit
