I am 5'8 255 lbs 42dd and i ordered the 3x and it fit fine chest not too tight and i looked great.


The fit was perfect. Beautiful dress. I received lots of compliments.


Love the dress!!! I'm 5'0" and 95 lbs. I brought x-small. The length and fit was perfect.  I would suggest buying the petticoat, it defiantly completes the dress.


Material is heavy but seems cheap. Was shiny and kind of rough to the touch. Also not very flattering on a short/petite torso.


adorable dress


The dress fits beautifully, but I have to wear a push-up bra with it. Other than that, it is lovely!


I never wear more than a medium in dresses and this one was way to tight.  Cute enough, and good for someone younger than myself.


great


Love this dress!  It needs ironing before every wear, but the fabric is comfortable, the fit is good, and I love how it looks on me.


ordered according to size chart and it was too big. had to return dress.  the quality was good just too big.
