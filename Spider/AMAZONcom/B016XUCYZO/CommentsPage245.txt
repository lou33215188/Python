I bought the small I'm 5'3" and 108 pounds it fits great!


Beautiful and fits well.


I love this dress! The fit the style the fabric is all so wonderful! This is my 2nd purchase.. I plan on order other colors!


This dress is made very well. And is of good quality. For $30 it's a steal! Hot topic would sell for $40-$80 easy! The only down is the belt. Way to big & it's cheap. But I used my own.


absolutely adorable!  this is for my 15 year old and she is thrilled!!!!!  classic and timeless!!!!!


Love this dress!!! Everyone around me loved this dress, I see ordering more in the future!!


Lovely dress ğŸ˜�but I would prefer a different color belt than the black one because black doesnâ€™t bring out the BANG in the dress.


I LOVE IT!!, I always feel so polished in it and I have yet to wear it and not be complemented on my dress MANY times.  Will be ordering another in a different print.  Thanks for bringing wearable style back to the not-so-tiny ladies!.


Great dress, price, and fits as expected, great summer dress, I love it


I received my dress the next day because of my Prime account. ğŸ‘�ğŸ�½Love the fabric, color, fit... I'm ordering more colours. I'm 5'8 and the hem of my dress is right at my knees. Photos later when I wear it.
