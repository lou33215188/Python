considerably shorter than i expected. I'm 5' 7" and weigh about 130 lbs and it hit me about 2-3 inches above knee.


I really wanted to like this dress. It's the type of silhouette that I adore. However, this dress just did not live up to my expectation. It was entirely too big - the bust area (which I based my sizing off of) was too big. I measured 3 times to ensure that I would get correct size. I had gaping problems near the arm area due to it being too large. The skirt also had entirely too much fabric. It creates a look of extra space, which was not flattering on me. The belt that also came with the dress was also entirely too large as it was twice the size of my waist. I only kept this because I would have had a hard time sending it back. Maybe sometime I will be able to purchase in a smaller size and have a bit better luck.


Adorable only wish it was a couple inches longer but still a Great Dress


As a plus size woman, I didn't know what to expect from his purchase but it fit as expected. Very pleased.


It's just as expected it fits wonderfully and I'm so excited to wear this


It was a little bit big on me but I do have a smaller frame. The dress is beautiful and made very nicely!


I love this dress!!


A+ fast shipping and BEAUTIFUL


Beautiful, just beautiful. Thank you.
