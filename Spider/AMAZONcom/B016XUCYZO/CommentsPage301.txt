Beautiful and very colorful! The belt was big, but I'm a tad small so belts never fit anyways. It's great for going out for formal events but causal enough to wear as a summer dress.


The fabric is nice.  I had to iron the dress, as it had fold creases for shipping.  I scratched a spot with my fingernail and pulled a thread in the material.  Now I have a white line near the waste line.  With a wider belt, the pull will be covered.  I haven't worn it yet.


Perfect fit! I love this dress. I am 5'6" and weigh 110. I usually wear an x-small. After reading reviews and checking the sellers size chart I ordered the x-small. This was a perfect fit, felt like it was made for me. I will be ordering more in different colors.


I LOVE this dress. it was a bit roomy in my underarm area, but overall I LOVE it


Really nice. Fit is great and comfortable.


I adore this dress... I love the way it flows and the material is great. I would definitely buy another!


I would like to return this dress for a 2X. The zipper is too tight on this one. It's a beautiful dress and I love the fabric and design completely. So feminine! I will order more than one if I get a proper fit !


This dress is great! Fit is beautiful! So glad that I purchased this dress!##


I like the dress but it is way to large. I will have it altered.


Love love love this dress!
