great fit


Great fabric! And looked great on!!


Use the sizing chart & you will not be disappointed with the fit. So cute & flattering! Made well too.


It fits me well ! I like it a lot !


beautiful dress!!  neckline is a tad wider than I expected.


It was a little big but beautiful, wonderful material,I didn't like the belt so I used one of my own. It came just below my knees (I'm 5'5-1/2"). Very comfy, the zipper is very long but manageable alone.


This product is very small I mean it's tiny! If that wasn't bad enough it's also impossible to return


Beautiful dress


I love it! It fits perfect. The belt is a little too long but that can be easily fixed.


This dress is extremely comfortable. I ordered this one & another one (black with purple flowers) as soon as I tried it on!! Colors are exactly as the picture shows and I love the full skirt!!
