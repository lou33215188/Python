It's very rare that I buy clothing online that fits perfectly, but this dress did and it looks amazing thank you


Good quality material. Fit as expected and i received compliments.


I woukd recommend.


we love the dress my daughter who is 10 really likes it. We ordered to big but were keeping it for later


It's a great material but a little too big for me in the chest area, so it winds up looking a little boxy but I am going to take it in a little and it will be fine!


This dress is beautiful!


good dress good material wish it had pockets


Cute dress and comfortable! It will be great for this Spring and Summer!


Excellent quality.  Heavy, gorgeous fabric.  I'm in between sizes and long waisted so the fit wasn't quite right so I had to return.  Boo!


This dress is beautiful and very flattering for a great price! It looks great with or without a tutu skirt under it. Have received many compliments. It feels very Audrey Hepburn :)


I ordered this for my daughter and ordered a size up. It fits her perfectly. The dress is well made and the fabric has a bit of stretch to it. It's a very cute dress!
