It did not fit well and I went by the measurements. I ordered a larger size and it fit even smaller. Would like a refund.


I am so glad to have ordered this dress. I love it!!


Absolutely adore this dress, very well made.


Fits very well.  If you have wide hips it is perfect as it is very wide. The fabric is printed on the outside only.  I am concerned it may bleed when washed.


Wish I could give this dress 5 stars... will be ordering in other colors! You will not be disappointed...


Excellent quality and material; great fit if you're between a 14 and 16 and get the XL


Great quality and perfect fit!


Waist a bit small S fabric very stiff/crisp


I wore it with an obi belt and loved it.  It's perfect for the spring and summer :-)


I love everything about this dress! Super full skirt, comfortable, lightweight, yet feels like quality. Fit perfect! Plan on buying a couple more! Definitkey recommend wearing a petticoat under it though!
