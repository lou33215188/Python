I love this dress!  Super flattering and the fabric is a little stretchy so it's very comfortable.  I'm order a couple more in other colors.

Small was snug but medium was too big. Made the small work for a derby. $30... can’t beat it!


I tried it on with my petticoat and it looks really good together.

Very pretty pattern.  Length is good but shoulders need to be altered slightly as neckline is a little bigger than wanted.
