I am utterly disappointed. I wanted the dress so bad. I ordered a black with pink polka-dots. I received a super ugly shirt instead. Yeah they refunded my money but I really really wanted the dress.


My 13 year old daughter needed a 50s themed dress for a class project. She is in love with this dress. It fit perfectly. It looks adorable. She now wears it anywhere a special dress is warranted.


Really cute dress.  Nice, full skirt, was used with a crinoline for a 50s dance.


Love love love! Fit like a glove and I got many compliments!


There were no washing instructions so I hand washed it and the black bleed onto the white.


Very short waisted but nicely made.


Adorable.  Love it


Cheap cheap cheap quality but fits great


I love this dress!  I got a ton of compliments at my parents country club for brunch, as well as, at church.


I'm a size 8-10 and bought a large.


She loves it.
