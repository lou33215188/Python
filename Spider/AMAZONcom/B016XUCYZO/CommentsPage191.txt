Just received my dress today.  It is beautiful and fits like a glove.  I bought an X-lg because my bust is a 40 D.  I am 4'10" but the length is perfect. Just a few inches below my knees, but with heels it is perfect.  The waist hits where it should.  I don't like the belt, so will purchase some ribbon in a coordinating color.  I did purchase a petticoat and it finishes the look perfectly. I plan on buying more in different colors.


Waist line was a little higher than expected, but this is a perfect dress for a cocktail party or for a good drag costume.


A D O R A B L E !


LOVE this dress. Fits as expected and is nice thick fabric! So pretty and very flattering cut. Will buy more in other prints. ğŸ–¤


Love this dress! So pretty and good quality for the price!


The material and construction of the dress is quite good given the price. I am 5' 2 1/2", about 110 lbs., and typically wear a petite size 0 to 2. I got an XS and it fit nicely.


LOVE, LOVE, this dress! Got so many compliments! I wore this dress to a Lavender & Lemon Luncheon and everyone had a fit over the dress! The hostess took photos to post for their event memorabilia :<) The material was of good quality; I will be ordering again. I highly recommend this company!


Absolutely perfect. This dress is beautiful and the fit is amazing. I usually have trouble finding dresses that fit well that I like but this one is amazing. I would definitely buy again


This is perfect. It's beautiful, the skirt swirls around and I love it :)


SUCH a cute dress. I ordered the wrong size, but it's seriously adorable.


I have SO many of these dresses in most styles they carry and I have the rainbow of petticoats to go with. The only place that's tight is in the chest. I have a large chest and I know that when wearing these dresses I have to wear my minimizing bra so that it fits properly. Other than that they are great dresses that I will continue to buy.
