This is a beautiful dress! Fits perfectly! I'm 220 pounds and trust me, it's tough to find a dress that makes you feel as this dress makes me feel! :) I ordered the XXL.


I liked it, but it was a bit too roomy for me to keep. The dress is pretty, but the material was too casual for my preference. I got 2 really great skirts for the price I paid for the dress so I didn't feel like it was worth it. I returned it.


Love this dress! I usually wear  XS - I'm 5'3 , 112lbs and XS fits perfect.


Very flattering fit, well constructed. Works well with a little crinoline for some added volume under the skirt.


Great dress, sending it bk for a large


I love this dress and fits perfectly. I received so many compliments on it. The only thing I changed was that I used a wider belt on it and it looked better than the one that comes with it. I'd love to get another one in a different color.


Just excellent! I'm 5'4" and 155lb and ordered L size. Fits as expected 100%. Very nice fabric. It has its length just the level of my knee. Can't wait to wear it tomorrow!


Price is great for the quality!! Fits well. Playful and modest. Blue dress with white polka-dots came with a black belt as described, the belt was far too big for the dress I ordered. And the only part of this dress I dislike is how the tag is attached.


I totally love it. My only problem with it is that the waist belt cut off the moment I tried it on and it seems sort of large for me but am ok with it. And my shoes matched it perfectly#Adorbs


I love this dress. I would recommend wearing a petticoat for a fuller skirt. The belt is a little cheap but you could always change it out.
