Love this dress!! It fit perfect and I thought I would need a medium but got a small instead and it worked out!! Beautiful dress and wondefully made!


Cute dress, but sizes a tad small through the breast line.


Too big, then washed it now too small, and it shrank SO UNEVENLY!  Ugh! Waste of money!  Not sure we can salvage it.


This dress is so beautiful! It fit perfectly, and that is tough if you're a curvy gal. I'm very happy with this dress and have received a lot of compliments already!


It was a bit large
