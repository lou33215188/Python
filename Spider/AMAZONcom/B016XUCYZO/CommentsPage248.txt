IT CAME TOO LARGE BUT WHEN I ALTERED IT TURNED MANY HEADS.


One of my favorite dresses. It fits like as expected. I wear a crinoline slip under to give it some volume.


LOVE this dress. I needed to add a "little black dress" for any occasion to my wardrobe. This dress is so comfortable and made surprisingly well for the price. Shipping was fast and I'm going back for another color. OK may try a smaller size. I'm usually a medium but I'm pretty busty so I ordered a large. I'm thinking I may get away with a medium. The fit is flattering with the high waist either way!


Material isn't what I expected it to be.


I receved a poor quality dress,Not lining and thin fabric, not as the photos to the others clients.  And just refund me a 30% to my purchase.  Very disappoint.


It fits great and looks so pretty! Comfortable and stylish. If you want it to look like in the picture you need to wear a petticoat.


I feel classy when I wear this


I LOVE this dress! I bought it on a whim for a Derby party (and a petticoat) and the medium fit perfectly! I am 5'5, 36C, 128lbs. I feel like $1M for only $28  :)


Well made. Very pretty. But I had to return it because I looked frumpy in it. I recommend this dress if you have a small waist because that's what it accentuates.


I LOVE this dress!! I'm 5"2, 142lbs, 38DD and I bought a medium and it fit perfect!! I loved the fabric and how it fit snug in all the right places. Very modest and conservative.
