Adorable. Surprisingly very good quality.


Dress was a little bit larger than expected, at the waist line, but beautiful and comfortable.


Above and beyond the quality expected. Simply gorgeous.


My husband saw the dress and really liked the fit and the design.  I hope when I have it dry cleaned, it will still look as good.


Got so many compliment at a wedding I wore it to.  Sadly the belt was too small. I had no use for it.


Nice dress. I didn't realize it was cotton.


I like the dress, but it is designed for Asian women who  have small rib cages.  I am not Asian, and could not zip it up over my rib cage.


Wore this to a wedding, loved it!! Received so many compliments!


Perfect little dress. Wife loves it.


The style is exactly as the picture and the color is amazing. I unfortunately had to return as the bust was too small.
