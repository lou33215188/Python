I wish the dress was longer but very nice


Bought this for my daughter for my nieces sweet sixteen. She loves it and it looks super cute on her. I also purchased a white petticoat to fluff the skirt out. Great dress for the price.


Very pretty but the material was not as nice as expected. Thin and very easily wrinkles.


the bust, though we selected for our daughter's measurements, is tight


Bigger in chest area but fits perfect everywhere else!


I feel so elegant when I wear this! The belt is also soft on one side.


Much nicer than expected - the color is rich and the fabric thick.


I used this for an outdoor, backyard wedding and it looks like a much more expensive dress in the pictures. I also received quite a few compliments on it.


Lovely dress was a bit small, so ordered a size larger. 5'6" 175 lbs and size 14 needed an xl. Packaging and quality of dress was great. Really requires a petticoat to look best.


It is a beautiful dress, but the waist of the dress hits about 2 inches above my natural waist. I do not have a particularly long torso, either. Otherwise, the sizing is as expected.


The material is adorable not cheap thick material . I love how it flows at the bottom its not a straight fit and lots of room. Defenitely will be buying another color.
