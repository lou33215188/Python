I'm in loveeee beautiful dress fix perfect I'm 5"3 150 lb I got a large is a very nice dress


It's an elegant and comfortable dress.  I'm between sizes and went up ... it's a bit bigger than I'd like but still reasonable.  I'm not a fan of the belt, no surprise there.  The care label claims dry clean only, but either in the questions or the description it claims you can hand wash it.


Fits perfectly, I bought  a 2X with a size 44 bust. Great fabric. Swings awesomely and liked perfectly with a petticoat.


This was purchased for a young adult and the fit was nice. She like it!


Comes below the knees and looks great with or without a petticoat underneath.


Nice dress, cute fabric, very classic style.  Good value.  I had2 return as the dresses wait/belt hit me at bottom rib.


buy it you will love it


was a bit tight around the torso and bust, but looked really good otherwise and the fabric is nice.


I really like these dresses. The hem could be a little larger and the bust could be slightly more tailored. I'd like to see more colors - particularly soft pastels.


Beautiful. Perfect!
