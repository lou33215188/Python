Love it!


Definitely needs a crinoline underneath to help it poof!


I was a little scared thought it was not going to fit because I need it for a funeral Saturday, because I ordered a size down. But to my surprise in fit perfectly I love the flow of the dress.


JUST TOO LONG SAD. i'm 5'4


Fantastic dress that fits well and is perfect for a variety of events.  This is the 2nd dress I have ordered in this style, and I have received endless compliments from people of all ages.  I highly recommend this dress!


Beautiful, fun, classy dress!! The fit is exactly right, and using a tulle slip underneath really takes it to the next level.


Looked pretty, too big.


The reviews said it ran small so I ordered i size larger and it fit perfectly. I love it so much I am considering another fabric pattern of the same dress.


The fabric is stiff and uncomfortable.  The dress doesn't drape when worn.


This dress appeared a bit dull when I got it as if it had been washed.
