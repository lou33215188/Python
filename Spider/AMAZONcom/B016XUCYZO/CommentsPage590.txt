i love this. thanks.


Cute and well made dress. Material is of good quality.


I went by measurements and nothing I bought fit


Best dress ever.


Classy! Fits great! My new fav dress!


very nice dress, got a lot of compliment wearing it


Perfect for my cruise


Perfect dress for a 50's theme party, can be used again for lots of other occasions!


way big on the sides, and longer than I expected it to be.


Love the dress. Ordered a XL which I normally wear but it was a bit tight.
