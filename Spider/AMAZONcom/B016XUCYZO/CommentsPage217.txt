Fits as it says


Can't wait to wear it.


This is a GREAT dress! It fit perfectly! I'm 5' 7", 32 A/B bust and a 27" waist and I ordered the XS. The first time I wore it, I got tons of compliments and when I told people the price, they were shocked. This dress definitely exceeded my expectations. I will certainly be buying more from this seller!


Beautiful dress definitely ordering other colors! I am to 220 and 5,6" I ordered an 1x and it fit perfectly.  Also wore it with a petticoat.


Really great dress, received a lot of compliments on it! It's a bit bigger than I expected (but that's just a problem with most clothes for my body! Fit well on the bust but loose around the waist) easily fixed with a belt. Very flattering, and went well below my knees so it was easily work appropriate. Love it!


cute cute dress! SO fun with it's twirly skirt to.


My granddaughter picked it out and I got it for her...she loved it and looked adorable in it...great buy!!


I usually wear a 14.  I am in love with this dress and I am certain that I will purchase more in the future.


This dress is a classic style,fits well but the material was not as I expected. The colors were bold but the material was flimsy. I brought to wear to a wedding but opted to just wear it to the Kingdom Hall for worship. Got lots of compliments and felt like a lady.


Love the fabric on this dress! It's great quality without being too heavy. I received lots of compliments. I will be ordering a lot more soon!
