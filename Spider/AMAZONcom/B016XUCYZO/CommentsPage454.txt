Fit as expected. Could use a little tailoring in the top.


Great dress!! Will be ordering more!


I love this dress! I'm planning on buying a few more colors and get some petticoat to go with them.


This dress is way too small. I am 5'1 and 115 lbs and dress was too small. It's also too long. Even if I ordered a size larger the shoulders and hip lines wouldn't line up.


It's cute. It came in all wrinkled up and the small is extremely big. Please make a extra small :)


I loved it and I felt really pretty. I wore it to Disneyland's daper day.


I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DRESS !!!!!!! I put it on the minute it arrived, it fits true to size and is just perfect such a steal !!!


I was very impressed when I received it in the mail. Perfect fit! The material isn't flimsy. I am definitely buying more of these in different patterns!


This dress is awesome couldn't have found a better fitting dress absolutely beautiful thank you!


I wore this as my bridal shower dress. It was amazing and I got so many compliments. I followed the sizing chart for this garment and it fit perfectly. Would definitely recommend.
