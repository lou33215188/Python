Adorable, but I'm returning for a smaller size. It was comfortable but gapped strangely at the neckline. I think one size down will be great.


Got this for my sister and i followed the size chart to her bust measurements and it was an exact fit.  Took one star away because the fit was too perfect thus leaving no room for weight gain.  My sister loved it!!


Absolutely stunning!!!! Going to buy more colors and patterns. This is my go to dress from here on.


I absolutely loved this dress. I wore it a wedding recently and was complimented all night about how great the dress looked. I was all decked out in the Vintage look and it was a big hit!


I was rather surprised by the quality of the material as well. I honestly expected it to feel thin and cheap but it wasn't. Now I want to buy this dress in every color!


Lays oddly without petticoat, otherwise great.


The dress fit me like a glove.  It is very attractive. I usually wear a Small or extra small so the small fit me just perfect.


A bit roomy in the bust- but over all a stunning dress


Very Pretty dress, but was too small


beautiful Dress will buy again. Nice flare! thanks cyndy


It was the third dress of this style that i ordered. I like this manufacturer and i get lots of comliments on these dresses.
