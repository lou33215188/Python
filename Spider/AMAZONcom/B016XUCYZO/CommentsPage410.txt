love this


Fit is fantastic and super forgiving with the high waist. I've received compliments every time i've worn it.


Beautiful dress!!! It fits perfect and looks amazing with the petticoat under it!!


Beautiful, exactly as pictured.

I wore this to a wedding and received several compliments! I bought the petticoat to make it fluffier and felt super cute all night:)


I love the dress but the quality of the zipper is poor.


Gorgeous! Got complimented by a fee people!


It runs a little large in the waist, but overall it's a great buy. If you want it to look fill in the skirt a petticoat is a must.


Somewhat large but fixable.  It is a beautiful dress that I will wear on a cruise.
