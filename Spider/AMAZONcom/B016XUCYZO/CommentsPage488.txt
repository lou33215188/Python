I loved this dress. I ordered two sizes larger as it is Asian sizing. Received lots of compliments. Looks better with a petticoat.


Beautiful fit. Love this dress..


Love love love this dress


Nice cut and decent quality for the price. Once I hand washed it and let it air dry it seemed to shrink around the shoulders.


Excellent quality, perfect fit. Very happy with this purchase!


Itâ€™s a beautiful dress, very well made.


love it.  little big in the bust but it isn't noticeable.


I had to return it because it wouldn't Zip all the way. Super cute!


Cheap material


Ordered this dress and was nervous that it wouldn't fit.  I am a size 14 and it fit perfect.  It's adorable but you need a petticoat under it.
