awesome dress, wore it to the horse races. Got lots of compliments


Looks just as picture and the material doesn't look cheap. I'm going to buy another one :D


Daughter loved it.


Dress fits well. I really like it a lot. It's really elegant and can be worn to any occasion. One thing though the dress came with a soil. I don't know if it can be removed and no apology was sent in this regard


Absolutely gorgeous dress.  Ordered the XS and it fit true to size.  I am thrilled with it!


Beautiful dress and fits perfectly!


This dress was so cute! I love the look and the pattern and softness of the fabric made it look much more expensive. The flare is great and the straps are supportive and covering. Great dress!


I am very disappointed with this item. It came in the wrong size, the material felt very cheap, and the cut of the dress- as well as the pattern on the dress- did not match the picture on the website.


Really good quality for the price.  I ordered a medium.  I am 5â€™2 and about 114 lbs.  I am a little bit broad for a short person.  I would definitely buy from them again.


Great dress, light material, nice bright colors to show
