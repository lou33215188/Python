The fabric is a heavy poplin material. Not really suitable for this style of dress. It is well made, but the bodice is petite sizing. The armholes are too high, as is the waist and bust. Fits in overall girth, just not accurate proportions for a standard build.


I absolutely LOVE this dress!  The fabric has a nice feel to it.  The skirt has a very nice swing and I look forward to wearing it again, this time with a petticoat.  I wore it to church on Easter Sunday and loved it.  I plan on buying the sky blue with small white polka dots next. Thank you!


Love this style dress, and the pattern is so cute. Great for all body types. Will definitely buy more in different colors/patterns.


Ordered this same print in a slightly different style and love it. This one, which I returned, is somewhat small and flares too much for my taste.


These dresses are super cute! Fit true to size. Well made, high quality fabric. The zipper tends to catch at the seam at the waist. The only downside is they're dry clean or hand wash only.


Super-cute retro inspired dress.  It's a little on the large side, but not too bad.  I love it.


Fits perfectly and is really cute! But it's definitely not a reason you can wear in winter as its thin material.  But I cannot wait to wear it on vacation this summer.


Were a 7-9, 36DD with a 27-29 inch waist order a lager it fit perfectly needed to order a lager but I can still fit into it


I loved this dress. One word of advice, if you are not wearing a crinoline under it, wear a straight slip or shorts under it, it will do a full Marylin in the wind.


Wore it to an outdoor wedding. Received lots of compliments. Follow the size chart. I ordered an XL, my measurements are 40", 29", 44". It would have been too tight around my bust if I had gone with the large, used a belt to bring in where it was a little loose around the waist.
