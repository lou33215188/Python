I am 5'3 and weigh 210lbs. I bought this dress in a 1X and it fits perfect! The length is just right, stops just below the knee. It has a great flair to the skirt. Zips up the back and I had no problem getting it zipped. Very flattering for a girl with curves. Very pleased with this dress!!!


Love Love Love Everything!!!Will be buying another one!!!


Beautiful dress!  My daughter wore it for her  middle school graduation, received lots of compliments all day , she loved it !!!


It was too small for me, so I sent it back, and the return was hassle free (unlike some other vendors).  It's well made.  The belt is included.


Very cute dress. Nicely made. A little large but I'm in-between sizes and would rather it be too big than too small. The belt makes this less obvious.


I normally wear a  4 or 6.  This dress fit perfectly, and is absolutely so cute.  You could wear this dress just about anywhere.  When I wore it, I received many compliments.


I absolutely love this dress!  I am a 14 in usual dresses and I ordered a XXL.  Fits like a glove.  Not too tight, but not loose.  I am quite pleased.  Only down side is that it wrinkles a bit easily.  But the fabric is very thick and the skirt is very full when there's a petticoat under it.  So excited to wear this out to dinner and dancing!


I love these dresses so much I bought three. Not so crazy about the thin belts, but they look great with some wide belts I already have.


I bought this Boat Neck Tea Dress for my daughter who is a size XS.  It came in and the fit was perfect.  It has a full skirt, cinched waist, and the material is a medium heavy texture.  Beautiful dress and fine quality.  God bless the hands who made this dress.  I'll buy more Grace Karin dresses.


It's great I love it! The only downfall is there is no liner, so you definitely need something under it.
