A great deal for such a low price. The dress I received had deodorant stains from  the last person that tried it.


Love the dress, every time I wear it I get compliments and want to know where I bought it.


This is a beautiful dress and it fits wonderfully. It is very comfortable to wear. My only complaint is that the fabric seems to wrinkle easily.


Such a cute dress!! Needs to be steamed to remove wrinkles. Great shape and fit.
