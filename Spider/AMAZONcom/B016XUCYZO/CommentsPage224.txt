This dress is a huge disappointment, and I really want to return it. It says it's high quality cotton and the piece I received is not even close to cotton or any quality! It looks very cheap and it doesn't fit good.


Very pretty! A little large in the chest and I think that's the first time I have ever said that because I am well endowed. Overall very happy with this dress.


Fits perfectly. Lots of compliments.


I love this dress except that they don’t adjust the arm whole for a larger size so it was digging in me all night and I couldn’t lift my arms. Aside from this I felt very comfortable when I never do in clothes anymore.


Beautiful dress and I received many compliments. Size 18/20 with 38F chest and short waisted. But this was even roomy on my chest area! So definitely size down but don't be afraid to buy. I still love it and its worth tailoring.


Quality much better than expected. fits well and looks gorgeous with petticoat underneath. i received many compliments from my co workers and will definitely look to this seller for future dress purchases.


Perfect


Everyone loved my dress. Very vintage and classy. I ordered a large but I could have gone with a medium. I’m 165lbs with 34DDD.


Love this dress!


I bought this dress for a party and was so excited to wear it. I got it in the mail faster than expected but when I went try it on....I could probably fit 2 of me in this dress it's sooooo big. I read comments on how it fit other women that are busty like myself so I went with the suggestions. Definitely with I didn't because now I can't return it.
