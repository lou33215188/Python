I LOVE


I'm 5' 2" and 110lbs. I ordered a size Small and it fits perfect! Wore it for Easter and got tons of compliments. The waist belt is black so I wore black heels to put it all together.

Can't beat this dress for the price. Adorable on. I wore it without a petticoat because it was a more of "business" event but if it were more of a cocktail event I'd add a petticoat. PROs: Fit & flare is very flattering. True to size. Only CON: Arrives VERY creased so plan to spend some time with the iron before you wear it. I immediately ordered another one in another pattern; can't wait to wear it too!


Great dress but the belt is too big.


Great Dress! Awesome quality for the price.


I normally wear a women's large in shirts, & 14 in dresses- This fit a little loose around my stomach, as well as my chest. With a wide belt I bought for this dress, you could never tell the dress was big on me. (The belt that comes with the dress won't help much, a wide belt honestly looks better.) Perfect for the 50's look I was going for.


Beware of pet hair, this dress will catch hair very easily.


Good product.


waist is too high


I ordered a large, even though, according to the chart, I should have been a medium.  It fit, and was even loose in the back, but was very tight in the front.  This is definitely made for small C cup or less women.  If I had gotten XL, it would gave been really too loose in the back, but more than likely too small still in the front.


The waist is also higher than usual, so it puffs out above the hips, more like right on the waist, and made me look dumpy.  In the late 50's to early 60's this style was popular, at least on tv, for awhile.  If you watch "The Dick Van Dyke Show", Laura wore a few dresses like it. (I always did think it looked weird, even on her).


If you are small chested, have a straight figure, and like the high waistline, you should like this dress.  The black and white sprig/flower print is really elegant, and the material is thick but not stiff.  I was surprised at how well made it was -- a superior garment, especially for the price.


It also arrived at the low end of the guestimated delivery time.  I think it arrived in a week and a half.


I bought this for my wife. It brings back the times when we still had a valuable and somewhat outwardly moral society. These styles are just as casually classy today as they were held a century ago.
