Dots are more hot pink than red!  Fits very nice and very well made.  Zipper got hung up alittle and it says you cant wear it in direct sunlight long periods of time?!?!


A little large in shoulders. Not dress fault


I'm a bit of a busty woman with a smaller waste, so finding a cute dress that fits nicely all around is difficult. I was a little nervous buying this but it fits beautifully! I would definitely buy another and recommend this product!


Very good quality, it is a little high waisted for me, fits as a petite.


One of my favorite dresses!  I get compliments on this everywhere I go.  It's cool and flowy.  It looks best with an under ruffle.  I can wear heels with it or throw on leggings and chucks underneath.  LOVE.


I bought this dress and I really, really love it! My only problem is it says it comes with a belt and I did not get the belt with the dress when it came in the mail. Otherwise I really love it and would recommend others to purchase it if you are into vintage style dresses.


Fast shipping and great quality for the price. Fits as described.


Beautiful


Excellent
