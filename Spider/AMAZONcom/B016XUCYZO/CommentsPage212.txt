Obviously love the dress. My 3rd purchase in different colors.


Beautiful dress! I added a petticoat underneath and got so many compliments on it at a cocktail party! Absolutely gorgeous!


Pretty much fit as expected.  I ordered according to the seller's chart, not amazon's.  The bodice will need to be taken in just a smidgen from below the bust line to the waist...I have this problem with a lot of dresses and tops, no matter where they come from.  I do wish I would have gotten a petticoat, though.


Beautiful and received many compliments!


I LOVE this dress! Very comfortable and I got my husband and teen daughters approval on cuteness! Don't mind the mess in the photo as it was laundry day with a newborn ğŸ˜‹ğŸ˜˜


This fits perfectly.


very pretty runs a bit small


Wife ordered two sizes bigger than regular size and dress was way too small. Who sizes these?


This is a beautiful dress.  I love the fit (perfectly).  I have ordered several dresses from this seller, and have NOT been disappointed yet.


I was so nervous ordering a dress from online, but I am so happy I bought this dress.  It's beautiful! The material is lovely and it fits perfectly. Thank you!!
