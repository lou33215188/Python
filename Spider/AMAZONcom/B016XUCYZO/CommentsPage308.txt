Dress is Beautiful and good quality . It came nicely packaged. I will not hesitate to order again.


I bought this dress for dapper day at Disneyland and got so many compliments on it. I fit perfect with the tutu skirt i bought separately. The material was very nice and fit comfortably. Glad I made this purchase! :)


It is a good buy.  It fit perfectly.  I irdered a large size, I usually wear sz 10.  Arrived promptly.


This dress is so cute. Very vintage vibe. Only complaint is that it is shown with a belt and did not come with one. I get compliments on this dress all the time.


Ridiculously small.  I wear a large to an XL if the cut runs tight and this XL was about 3 sizes too small.  It ships from China so there are issues returning since you have to pay.  The material is the thinnest polyester I have ever seen and the hem is something I could have done in my 7th grade sewing class.  Zipper is cheap plastic and the neckline has a flap of material that isn't finished. The company offered for me to ship on my own dime UPS only to Rhode Island and then take a month to 6 weeks for a refund or take 35% off the cost.  Since it was so cheap the freight would have cost 50% of the dress so goodwill will get something new.  They said they hoped I would write a good review but them I got the refund and it was only 28% so all bets are off!
