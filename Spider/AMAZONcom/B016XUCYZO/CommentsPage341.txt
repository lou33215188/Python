I would suggest getting the next size up from what you normally are.


Poor quality material and the top area of the dress was significantly small, causing the Waistline to fall at the bustling.


My wife love it


Nice dress but runs a size small.


Darling dress!!!  Great find for the price.  Wore it for a theatre performance and it worked perfect!


I bought one of these dresses, and proceeded to purchase 3 more in different colors after receiving it! This is perfect! It fits exactly like a dress my mom had from the 1940's... Very fitted from the waist up, and very feminine from the waist down. I love them!


The fabric was comfortable and flowed well. I read the reviews and ordered a size up because I was afraid it would be too small, but I should have ordered my size because I ended up having to take it in. So cute on! I'm trying to find a reason to wear it again! ğŸ˜Š


I got so many compliments when I wore this dress ! Everyone asked me where I purchased it and they thought it was from a very high end store because of the cut,design and look of the dress ..extremely happy for ordering it online


Cant wait to wear it to a wedding


I just received mine in the mail and I LOVE IT. It fits me perfectly and it's super flattering. The fabric is stiff enough so the skirt holds its shape, even without a petticoat. I will definitely be ordering more!
