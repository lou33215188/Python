Gorgeous dress but it was a little too large. With a little amendment to the side it fitted perfectly. I wore it with a tutu skirt petticoat and wow, I got the exact look I desired. Got lots of compliments throughout the day on how beautiful the dress was. Will definitely be purchasing more dresses in the near future.


Such a classic! I will be ordering in different colors!


I love this dress very, very much


OMG, I so loved this dress. I will be ordering many more!


I'm 5'5", 165 lbs, size 12, large breasted. This fits just right in an XL. Large could have probably worked.


This dress was the perfect fit. However, I expected the material to be much softer. I only noticed the material after I took the dress out of the package and went back to check my order. No worries though. It definitely served it's purpose.


Love it. Classy and stylish. Makes me feel like a pretty princess.


Dress shipped quickly and fit perfectly.  I wear it with a petticoat underneath and I love the look.  Great quality.


I love this dress! It fits perfectly and is well made. It looks so pretty. I've gotten a lot of compliments when I wear it. I would buy it again in different colors.


Nice dress, but way too big.  The sizing chart was way off.  The material and workmanship was above average.
