Dress is adorable, except it didnâ€™t come with the belt!!! ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡


Great little dress.


Love, love the dress. I have received a ton of complements from friends and family.


This dress is adorable and comfortable and super flattering!!!  I received compliments all day at the function I was at. Will definitely buy more in various colors! In addition this dress is really cute by itself but a petticoat really helps to complete the look.


Thank you so much.


This dress is EXACTLY what I had hoped for! I'm 5'7" and 130 lbs and a small fit me perfectly. It's really stunning. The material is sturdy, the length is great and I cannot wait to use it for my engagement photos! Definitely will buy more in the future! Looks great alone or with a crinoline skirt!


Soooooo cute and very well made. I did cut the belt down, but it still looks good. If I hadn't had to do that, it would be a 5 star review.


I'm usually very skeptical about buying clothes online, but I saw how many great reviews this dress got and they were all RIGHT. This dress fits perfectly; has a great shape and is a nice cotton material. I'm 5'8" and about 155 lbs and ordered a Medium and it fits really well. And with this price, it's basically a steal. I'll probably get another one in a different color :)


I'm 5'4 and 135 lbs. Ordered a large because I worried about ordering a medium and it falling too short. Ended up falling the right length at my knees, but the waist and shoulders came out a little too large even when tying the belt on its smallest setting.


This dress is as beautiful in person as it is in pictures. It's a little big at the neck but otherwise beautiful. I cannot wait to wear it out.
