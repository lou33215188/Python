Love this dress! Didn't like the little belt that came with, so I found a wide black retro that works great!


Absolutely beautiful dress!! Great material!! It was a little big but we had it tailored to fit perfectly!


Love the pattern and the dress really is as puffy as they advertise. Very flattering.


The cut is not made for women with large breasts. If you're 44DDD you won't be able to zip the dress past your breast


I followed the size guide and it came in way to big.


Cheap material, but very cute!!


bust was a bit tight


Waistline too short, could be a little longer to actually reach down to the waist, would give a more lean look rather than stubby look. Otherwise, a well made, and beautiful dress.


My daughter likes very much. good quality


I really loved my dress and the fit was perfect. I got an awful lot of compliments. You must order the tutu as well. It gave the dress an extra sassy look.  The dress gets Two Thumbs Up!!!
