nice dress


This dress is cute and fits well (based on measurements chart).  Only con is that it is a bit see through.


Gorgeous material, looks beautiful on my sweetie - this was a birthday present, and she loves it!


I've worn this dress to two special occasions. It's light but totally worth the (not expensive) price. So many compliments on it.


Great fun dress for casual party. I like the style. The material is ok. The size fit me perfectly. I am 5'7'. About 140bl. I got size "s".Everything fit perfectly. Just wish the fabric could be little bit softer.


great quality, fit is very nice. THe fabric is heavy and has a nice sheen to it, You cant beat this for the price. exactly what I needed for a 50's do-wop girls trio Im singing in!


Liked the dress. But the size is small and it doesn't fit well. So returned this one. Quality is also OK.


I purchased this dress to wear to a garden Bridal Shower.  It is well made with a beautiful floral print.  Looks just like the picture.


The fit is very flattering.  I received many compliments.


Absolutely LOVE this dress! Fits is to size and is just super cute. Price was amazing.  Once I tried this one on, I bought the black one as well for an upcoming wedding.


I loved wearing this dress. I am a size 16 and the 3x fit me perfect. I felt absolutely beautiful in it. And the fabric is fantastic. I wore it to a hot outside wedding. The fabric was durable and breathable. So happy with my purchase!!!!! I might even get the same dress is more colors.
