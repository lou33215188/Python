Fits great in the Bust  but I can tailor the waist and I love the pattern style. Main reason for purchasing it.

LOVE this dress.


My daughter looked beautiful in it!


Fit well and is surprisingly comfortable.  Arrived quickly and other than a few hanging threads, I'd definitely order again.


adorable and beautifully made - i would order more colors if they had more pastels and pinks!


The sizing chart is off. This dress did not fit the measurements that were given. It was beautifully constructed and the material is good quality.


Very classy dress. I have gotten so many compliments on this dress. It's very flattering on.
