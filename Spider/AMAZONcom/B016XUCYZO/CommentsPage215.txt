loved this dress


I love this dress! I was very excited that all the review said they fit as expected. Unfortunately, when I got the dress and tried it on I couldn't even get it over my head! I typically wear an extra large in most clothing, this dress was probably two sizes too small! It was definitely a bummer...


This dress is perfect! Ordered for a wedding and got tons of compliments! Made with a heave fabric. No need for a slip. I will definitely be getting more in other colors


Size was perfect.


I received so many compliments when wearing this dress.  I don't wear the belt.  I love the fit and the style is great for me.  I also have this in Navy.


Love this dress! It was perfect for me to wear to and from my wedding so my husband didn't see my wedding dress! (We eloped)


Love everything about it except its a tad small. I usually wear a size 14-16 so i got the xl (16-18) and its more like a 12-14.


This is b-e-a-utiful! I got the black with red roses and I want to order one in every color they sell!!!  If only I could. ğŸ˜�


tooooooo cuteee


fits nice. I am normally a size large but ordered and XL and was a little big on me so the size is as expected.
