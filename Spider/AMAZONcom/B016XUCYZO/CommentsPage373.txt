I look beautiful and shapely


Very pretty dress and very nice material...Thanks for the good service....


The dress is a great fit. It's super cute and I got loads of complaints on it. You can wear it with or without a petty coat but I choose to wear one.  I will be ordering another in a different color very soon. Completely satisfied ğŸ˜�


Awesome dress!!!


thank you


love the dress. I weigh 187 and the large fits perfect


Very nice dress for the high tea I attended. The tutu underskirt was the cherry on top.


Pretty dress, heavier fabric than I expected but the little stretch is good.


Would be higher bent didn't cons with dress


This dress is so super cute! I have a wedding to attend this summer and can't wait to wear it.
