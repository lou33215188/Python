Very cute,  very flattering, good material. I'm 5'8, 157 and a large fit me just ever so slightly loose. I probably could have gone down a size,  especially since the material is a little stretchy,  but I'm happy with the way it fits. And man can it twirl!!! The little kid in me loves that.


Cheap!!!!!


This dress fits great! I ordered it according to the sizing chart. I wear a 4 and ordered it in a small. No problems. There material is great and sturdy...doesn't feel cheap


Did not fit at all. I ordered a very large size and still it was extremely small. I wear a size 20 womens. 4x is more like a size 12.


Great fit and flare. Is thin so I am looking at wearing a slip underneath.


I just received this dress and though it is a very cute dress the material and tag clearly state it's 100% polyester. Not the cotton and 5% spandex it claims. Living in Florida polyester is tough. I feel duped and shame on you for selling this product listed otherwise.


Great quality for the price. Shipped right on time


Perfect fit :)


I Love it and is considering getting it in other colors


I bought this to fit my daughter, she could have used a size smaller. It was very loose on her but it is very pretty and she still wore it and looked great!
