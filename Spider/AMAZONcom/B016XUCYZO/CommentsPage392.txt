I ordered an xs and it fit perfectly. (I'm  5'10") The belt wad the only problem, it is extra extra long.  Quick fix, I cut belt and created new belt holes.


Very pretty dress. Good quality for the price.


Pretty dress, beautiful color blue with polka dots. Fits perfectly. I wear 14. The dress was true to my size. Length is good. I am 5'3 and it hits right at the knee. Not too short, not too long. Nice, quality material.


Gorgeous dress.  great retro look for a great price.  it is true to size but runs slightly on the large side dont worry about it being to tight. Its also a slightly stretchy material.
