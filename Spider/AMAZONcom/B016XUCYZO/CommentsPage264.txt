Love, love, love! It fits well, is comfortable and incredibly flattering! I did buy a petticoat to go under it and it made a world of difference! I can not wait to wear it!


Love this dress! If you follow the sizing chart you should be fine. I bought the burgundy one. the color was a little off (a little more red) but I didnâ€™t mind.


Beautiful dress!  Perfect Fit!


Very happy with dress. I have bought Grace Karin dresses before and the quality is excellent as always.  I'm an NZ10 and the medium fits perfectly.


I bought this fir my 10 years old daughter in small. It fits a bit larger than a junior size but it is so beautiful. Will be wearing it for EID.


Got the dress as gift for my wife. Cloth was really nice and looked so pretty.


This dress is so cute. It fit perfectly. Absolutely adorable with a petticoat underneath. The material is nice and soft. The zipper might be a little flimsy. We'll find out when it's actually on for a couple of hours I guess. The price was certainly right. Finding this dress here saved me from spending $80 elsewhere.


The dress was suppose to come with a black belt, and it didn't. Dress is a bit shorter than expected. I'll be returning it.


Love the dress a little tight on my girl tho. Sizes fit a bit smaller.


I love this dress!! I'm between a 14/16 and ordered the XL.  The dress is made exceptionally well and beautifully tailored.  This dress looks and fits like it would cost a fortune but at $30 I will be buying more than one color.
