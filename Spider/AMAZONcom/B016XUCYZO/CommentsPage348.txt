Adorable! I bought a petticoat to go under. It's perfect!


Beautiful dress! It fits perfectly and is exactly what I have been looking for. I haven't seen anything like it in anywhere else and am very happy to have found it on Amazon. It couldn't have been a better buy or shopping experience.


Size of dress runs small. Did not like the sizing, gave dress away.


I love this dress.  It is so 60's.  This type of dress is good for nay body shape.  It can transform you because of the fit and flare style it has.  Love it.


Love it!


It fits great and the print is prettier in person. I was a bit afraid that it would be somewhat transparent where it was white, but it wasn't. The silhouette was exactly what I was looking for. My biggest issue with the dress was that it is extremely wrinkle prone.


Love this vintage dress.  Material is really nice and love the color.  It is a dress you can wear out to dinner or even to work and also dressy enough to wear to a special occasion  It was also a good price for the quality..


Perfect for the 50's banquet she went to. We also ordered a petticoat to create the fuller effect. She got nothing but compliments!


I absolutely love this dress!  It is so lovely!  It fits perfectly too!  High quality fabric, beautiful floral print, definitely worth the price!


I love the look and the fit of this dress...but after 3 months of wear the zipper has ripped a hole in the fabric and is no longer wearable! I loved this dress for work :(
