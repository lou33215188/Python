Great fit and a beautiful dress


I am THRILLED with this dress. I usually wear 2x but Ordered 3x just to be safe & it fits great. Will buy more from this brand


Beautiful dress.


Perfect fit, quality could be better but for the $ it's a steal.


Was happily surprised by the weight and quality of the material. It is a beautiful rich blue. Fits nicely and has a full skirt. Only problem I found is that while the belt is cute it smells terrible even after airing it out for days. Overall pleased with my purchase.


Pretty dress! I wore it to a wedding and got complimented.  I could have ordered the XL instead of 1plus because my top is smaller than my hips but I had on a cardigan anyway so it wasnt noticeable.


This dress is so beautiful. You feel like you're back in the 50's. I LOVE IT!


I absolutely love this dress! It is very well made, and it fits great! The size chart is very accurate. The length is great going a little past my knees, and the design (I got the floral one) looks just like the photo!


Love this dress! Pretty true to size even tho I went up 1 size...it fit perfectly!


Loved this dress very pretty pattern and flattering fit; I received a ton of compliments at the Kentucky derby party we attended. Great quality especially for the price
