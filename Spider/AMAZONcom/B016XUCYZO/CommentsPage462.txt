I had ordered a medium but was a little tight under the arms, I ordered the next size and fitted great. Returned the other dress and in two days was issued a refund with no problems.


Fun to wear!


This dress is beautiful! Fits very well and made from quality materials.


I like the way the dress fits and I would buy another dress by the same designer, The only thing I didn't like was the belt


I'll be sending this dress back...it was too small and the waist was way too high and the dress is too short for my taste.  I think it could be cute on the right person.


Cute and fits well!


It fit amazing but the belt broke out of package.


This dress is amazing!
