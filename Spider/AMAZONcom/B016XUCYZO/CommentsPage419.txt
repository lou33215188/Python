It fit with our being tight. I'm 5'3" 98lb and I got the xs and the only thing is I might take it in a quarter in on each side for my waist


a bit small in the breast area, my co workers loved it.  Me I can take it or leave it.  I'm 5'1" and 159lbs so I look really huge in that type of dress but its needed for our annual function that the theme is the 50's.


Quite frankly, I did not expect the dress to fit. On-line shopping for clothes is often disappointing. The dress fits perfectly. This mother-of-the groom will not look as gorgeous as the bride, but the father-of-the groom will be glad again that he married me 40 years ago.


great dress, made of quality materials. fit good has great structure and holds in what needs to be held.  will buy more


Love the style & fit ğŸ˜Š


Granddaughter loves the dress just above her knees and arrived on time


My wife is very please with the dress and that is what counts.


This dress is amazing! Fits like a glove! Cant wait to wear for my birthday ğŸ’�ğŸ�¼â€�â™€ï¸�


My daughter wore this dress for a fifties dance and looked very beautiful.  She wears a size 2 and the extra small fit her well.  She is 5'6 and it went to her knees.  Thank you!
