I loved this dress. It fit like a glove. I got quite a few compliments on it! I wore it for Derby Day! Great sturdy material and very well made!


GORGEOUS. Fits perfect, very flattering. Love the material. I received many compliments. Matched it with bright red shoes. Love it.

This is very small. But it is a pretty dress. I gave it to my daughter. I do love the pattern and material.


Absolutely no complaints. Bought this dress for a wedding and it fit perfectly. A belt came with it as well. The material is comfortable. No issues with the zipper. I actually plan on buying some other prints in different colors.


It is a beautiful dress! Perfect fit. I am buying another one as a gift.


Super fabulous I love it I got an extra small probably should have got a small but still very nice
