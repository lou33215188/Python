Beautiful, very good quality


PERFECT FIT! GREAT QUALITYğŸ–¤


Loved everything about, except for the waist.  It was a little too high, but I'm really happy with it otherwise! ;)


It's awesome with pettycoat.


I was little tensed wether this would be suitable to my sister, but after she wore this... Gosh she looked awesome !!


Very cute and well made! Just make sure to look at the measurements and it should work fine!


This dress is made of polyester not cotton. Fit was good and the pattern looks better in person. Nice, but not what was expected.


I love this dress!  I will definitely order more.  It made me feel elegant and feminine like a girlie girl.  I consider it a conservative fun look.


This dress is gorgeous! The wife loves it! And she looks gorgeous in it!


I typically wear a small (5'2", 120 pounds) and ordered the same in this dress. It fits perfectly. Very nice quality fabric and construction for price.
