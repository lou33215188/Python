I bought a size larger,  and the chest was still very tight, so I ordered another and it fit ok at best in the chest.  I usually wear a size 12/large in dresses, my chest is a 38C, and the XXL fit. Because it was so snug in my chest,  the armholes were uncomfortable.


Pretty and very retro.  Looks good on


But it fits an I am excited to wear this dress very much


Worth every dollar!  Luxurious fabric and well made.  I wore it with a petticoat and a gold beltza but it comes with its own belt.


Very pretty dress. Seems well made. Fits great. The only issue I have is that up close the fabric looks like it has lint all over it that does not come off, it is just part of the fabric. Other than that it is great so I did keep it.


This dress along with Vintage Black Petticoat was a gift for my 25 year old daughter and she loved both items.  Great quality and fit!  Ordered another set.  Great choice of colors.  Very happy with purchase.


Very pretty dress, got a lot of compliment


Very cute though


This dress is amazing! OMG! I am totally getting all the patterns...it fits perfect!


Love this!
