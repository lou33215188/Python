One side was longer. That was a little weird.


My daughter loved it, do also her miter when she saw it.


Sizing was off. Tended to run smaller than listed. Ordered two sizes to ensure that I could wear the dress.


I live the material the way it hangs and the fit all great.


Somewhat snug at the top, but overall a cute buy.


Loved it
