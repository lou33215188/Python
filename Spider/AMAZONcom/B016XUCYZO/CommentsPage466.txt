Love this dress!!! It isn't see through and it fits great!! It covers everything and still makes me look good.


If you have a bust, this dress with start flowing out too high and it will look like a maternity dress.

I absolutely love this dress. My only wish is that it had loops for the belt on each side.


Cute dress arrived on time and as expected

The dress fit beautifully. The cut suites my body type nicely  (I am stalky, and short). The material is soft and very comfortable.


This dress is beautiful and fit like a dream! As a plus sized woman I'm very happy with the length, fit, and it's a great material!


This dress was perfect for the wedding I went to and got more compliments then anything else I have ever worn!


Got this dress for my college graduation and it was perfect. It reached just below my knees and was a great choice for a more formal event.
