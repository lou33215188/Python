Excellent price!  Very good quality.  I love this dress.  I purchased the black and white dress and wore it with a thin black cardigan.  Love it and got compliments on it.  Will purchase more.


This dress is one of my favorites. I wore this to church for Easter and I received so many compliments. I highly recommend this dress and donâ€™t skip on the petticoat, youâ€™ll  look like a southern bell.


BEAUTIFUL DRESS! It's absolutely beautiful. I just wish that more colors came in my size.


The sizing on these are really, really small.  I ordered an XXL because of the reviews about small sizing.  The XXL was so small I couldn't even try it on.


Looks good on my daughter but could be an inch or 2 longer for her liking.  But it is a wonderful dress.


This dress is gorgeous!!  Somewhat light-weight material. But has a nice satiny sheen that makes it a bit on the dressier side. Looks awesome with the included belt and a crinoline petticoat underneath. Looking forward to wearing this at a May evening wedding and feeling fabulous! ğŸ˜Š


I read reviews and I seen that this runs short in the torso, so I ordered a larger size... wrong. It pretty much runs true to size. But it did seem to have too much material around the bottom. I'm sure a crinoline would be necessary for the full effect.


As many of you know sizing varies with each seller. I followed the size chart from the dress photos and the dress fits right. Usually i wear a Large or extra large from walmart, targe, etc but here i am a 1X plus. 44 bust, 37 waist and it fits enough loose to not fill squeezed. Fabric is flowy and soft. Will buy again from grace karin.


Such a comfortable dress! It is gorgeous and flattering. I'm very busty and have trouble finding dresses, but this is perfect. The belt did not fit, or work well with the dress, but I did not miss it one bit. Will buy more!


Love it!!! And got so many complaints when i wore it!!! If i had more money i would buy it in every color!!!
