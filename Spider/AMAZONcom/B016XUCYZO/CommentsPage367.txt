Got this for my mom and she absolutely loves it arrived on time fit as expected


Great fit and really good quality for the price. I plan on buying a few more!


Love this dress!!!!! The quality of it is outstanding. Fabric is soft and the fit amazingly flattering!


It fits perfectly and is just beautiful with an added petticoat to give it fullness.


Love it. Fits perfectly. Very flattering and accentuates the waist! It hangs really well on me and I don't really need the petticoat underneath even though I did try it and it looks cute either way. Can't wait to wear it to my friend's wedding in the spring.


Did not fit.  Very short waisted.


Love this dress. I'm 5'4", 131 lbs and ordered a medium. I don't wear the belt or a pettycoat with it though. My husband loves the way it looks on me!!  He says it's sexy and feminine. I think I'll order a couple more in different colors.


Great dress & price phenomenal


This dress is true to size.


Beautiful dress. Fits as expected. We did use sizing chart. Very nice material,a little stretchy which my daughter liked.


It looks adorable. Will order more.
