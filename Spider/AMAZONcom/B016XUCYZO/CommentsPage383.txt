I love it so much that I am back to purchase another in a different color. Beautifully constructed!


The dress is cute as a button.  Fits more snug than other apparel in this same size but the length is perfect for the style. Empire fit unless you are shirt waisted.  I gave this a 2 because of the care instructions printed on the package.  You can not wash it.  Have to use very low heat to iron but the kicker is that it says do not wear in prolonged sun.  I live in Florida, really.  Definitely a one time wear dress for an inside function.


I love the dress. You get what you pay for. It looks exactly like the picture. The quality of the dress is great, the fabric is great as well. It fit me perfectly even with the belt. I love this dress a lot.


This is a beautifully cut well made dress.  The cut is a little small in the bust so if you have a larger bust area, you may want to order up a size.


Very pretty. It has a satin, shiny feel and look.


While I  haven't worn the dress going out yet, it fits perfectly. Quality seems good and I love the fabrics and colors.


Tons of compliments. Comfortable and fits perfectly!


This is a beautiful dress!


I cannot begin to tell you how unbelievably delighted I was with this dress. The price was so outrageously affordable I ordered 4 for my son's wedding with the intent of returning 2. Instead we kept them all and cannot wait to find an event to wear them to. My girls and I are the same size so I ordered a size 6. The fit is perfect and the material of the dress is nice and thick. The packaging was beautiful and these dresses can be worn with or without the petticoat (sold separately). The attached photo is with petticoat. LOVE THE DRESSES and YOU ROCK!


The dress was perfect. Nice fabric with a little bit of stretch. The item is true to size.
