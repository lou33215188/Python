Wish it would have fit


Perfect! Love it! I usually wear an 8 or 10. Bust 38, waist 34. Large fit perfect. Nice heavy fabric.


I love this dress! Its not a heavy dress so im not hot the whole time wearing it! Very comfortable!


So pretty! I got my normal size and it fits perfect. I got a 1x. I'm normally a 16/18. It's very full without the tulle slip. I want all the other prints!


Lovely.  I love it


Hangs nicely, Good value.

Very beautiful dress. The only reason I gave 4 star is because there was a small rip in the zipper and I had to sew it before I wear.


This dress is amazing ! The fit is perfect, the fabric is a very nice quality , and the sewing is great ! I will be buying this dress in many different prints


Just what I was looking for. Bit wide in the shoulders, but well-fitted elsewhere. Received many compliments.


It fits perfectly! I'm always nervous ordering clothes online but I'm so glad I took a chance on this dress. I needed it for a 50s themed party and it was a great choice!
