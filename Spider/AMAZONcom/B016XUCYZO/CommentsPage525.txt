Cute and fun. I actually wear it to the office and it feels and looks great all day.


The dress was for my granddaughter. Fit great and couldn't ask for better quality. Very satisfied.


Nice and feminine. It is a blast.


It's a beautiful dress. Would order in other colours


This dress is so cute but the M was too small.  I ordered a large and it fits beautiful. I love the quality of the material.


Love it got two of them


Very cute dress for the price. Needs petticoat for volume.
