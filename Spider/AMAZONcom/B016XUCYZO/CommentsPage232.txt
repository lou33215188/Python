I do love this dress but it does run small i say buy a size up. I would have exchanged it had it not been for the fact i orderes it for photos and had no time. I bought an xl but it was tight abound my bust (38D), also if you want the dress to be full you will need a petticoat. However you need a petticoat with most vintage style dresses you want full.


I just love it.  Ware it to a wedding had a lot of complements on it.  Told the women where to buy them.


Lovely dress!  A small fit perfectly (I'm 5'4", 32C chest, 27in waist)!  Nice material.  Arrived quickly.


Love this dress! I wore a thick petticoat under and it looked amazing!


I LOVE IT!! The ONLY thing I'd change is the color of the belt that comes with it. Instead of black, I'd have gone with, either, a white, blue, or even a green belt.


Bought this for dapper day in Disney and received so many compliments! So cute and comfortable, I loved wearing it!
