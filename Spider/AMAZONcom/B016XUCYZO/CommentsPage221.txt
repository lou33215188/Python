Love it. Only issue is it wrinkles super easy. Great quality


Get a size larger thhan the chart says to get a fit. Besides that the dress is beautiful! Flows just right.


This dress fit me like a glove. I got a lot of compliments. The one complaint I have is that it was difficult to get wrinkles out of.


Lovely quality and fits beautifully.


Love this dress! I bought it in multiple colors. I'm a heavier lady and the cut of the dress is very flattering.


Really disappointed in these dresses, though I guess you get what you pay for. The material was a really cheap feeling, stretchy material (not cotton like it looks like). The small size was too big and the extra small was too small. It's a shame because the pattern is very cute.


Awesome product and seller.


Sure, it's pretty and fits appropriately, but the main reason I purchased this dress was because the description said it was cotton + spandex only. This is a cheap polyester blend + spandex, which means the fabric doesn't breathe as well, nor is it as comfortable on the skin.


Gorgeous dress. My daughter loves vintage clothing and this dress looks absolutely adorable on her.


Dress is beautiful! Heavy fabric, well made. I ordered a M, my measurements are 36D, 29", 36" and  5'6". Fit was perfect. Belt was indeed pretty useless but it's not necessary anyway. Full.skirt. I bought a crinoline to puff it out (and make the waist look smaller at the same time). Definitely recommend.
