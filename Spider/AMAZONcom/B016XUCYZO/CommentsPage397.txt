cute dress but runs small and sub-quality.


Ordered this dress as a gift for someone with measurements of 35" bust and 29" waist. The medium was a bit loose in the bust, but overall the fit was great. Received my order within one week as expected.


This was very high quality! Pretty good fit. It was a little bit bigger than I'd like but I did order a size up.


Lovely dress, a bit large in the waist, but the belt fixes that.  Wear a petticoat underneath to dress it up!


love it!


So cute!! I got lots of compliments and was very comfortable.


love love love


Perfect fit! I love it!


I love this dress. It is very comfortable and fits very close to the size.  My only hang up is that is it dry clean only.


This dress fits just as described.  I love the look of this dress.  Will be perfect for the wedding I have coming up!
