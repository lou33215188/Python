Perfect, my wife loved it.


I love this dress! I get tons of compliments when I wear it.


The dress was purchased for a school dance. The waist fits greats and it flows nicely. It is too big for my daughter in top. But she loves it.


Its adorable. 5,6, 143 lbs and the medium fit perfect. It even has a little stretch to it so you can move. Using it for a 50's style dance.


Dress is gorgeous, colors are bright, fit is amazing. Ordered a large (I am 36DD, sz 12 dress)


Unfortunately, I had to return because the sizing was too small.  Cute dress though!


Nice material, but cuts into my shoulders. Smaller than I expected.


This dress is so cute! It fit perfectly and looked really nice and well made.


This dress was sized for an infant!  When I ordered an adult XL.


Very have with this dress.
