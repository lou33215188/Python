Fabric was a little bit rougher...maybe thicker is a better word.  It just wasn't as soft as expected.  However, i really love the dress, it is comfortable and is a good fit.


I love this dress! I can't wait to buy more. Make sure to buy the crinoline slip to fill out the skirt ;)


This dress is perfect for my mom. She's going to look beautiful in it. The quality is good.


Love this dress! Fit great. I'm 5ft 8in, weigh 180lbs, and wear a 36D, got this in a large and it fit great! Wore it to an outdoor wedding in Nebraska and got several compliments!


There is just too much material.  I wish they would have taken some of the ruffles out.  However, the material is nice.


Fit great! I ordered the 2x because I wanted to make sure I would have room in the stomach area. I'm normally around a size 16, and if I wasn't pregnant the 1x would have been the size I went with!


Love this dress!!!  I'm 5'2 about 115lbs and small busted. I ordered an XS. It fit me like a glove! The skirt came just to my knees. The belt was definitely too big but that's ok. I wasn't planning on wearing it anyway


Fits beautiful. I can zip it up, however I'll probably have to go w/o a bra as it's a wee bit snug. The rest fits great.


In love with that dress!!!


very cute dress, order a size up, did not fit per the size chart
