Cute but belt falls off and it ran pretty small. I have a wide ribcage and this made the product difficult to wear and the belt fell off easily from the ribcage (which was an unusual place to fit the belt anyway. Not like the photos and wouldn't buy again.


Love this little dress it's the perfect dress for summer and has a flattering fit I'm very happy with the purchase


Great quality, beautiful fabric, and so cute! It does fit very closely in the body, so doesn't hide any problem areas, but that's what shape wear is for!


Its super nice and summery. Beautiful flowers and nice energy.


Material is heavy quality and beautiful print. I love it!


Nice dress


For the price this dress is adorable.  Absolutely love it will order more as it comes in many different colors .


I bought this dress for church I can't wait to wear it...I had the prefect outfit in mind for this I'm so excited.


Very pretty dress. Fabric felt nice. Ordered the 3X but fit like a size 14.


I still give this a 5 star because I loved it so much I am retuning for a smaller size!
