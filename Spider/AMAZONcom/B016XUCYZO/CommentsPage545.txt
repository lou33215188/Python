Lovely, feminine dress. Received many compliments!


Nice dress, runs small. The material isn't stretchy so you have to order at least two sizes up.


I got it for my best friend as a surprise present and it looked amazing on her na fitted her like a glove. I got the XS.


It was perfect thanks!


Love it.
