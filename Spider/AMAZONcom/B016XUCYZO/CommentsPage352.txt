This was a gift for my younger daughter, and she just loves this dress. We bought it specifically for her high school graduation, but she's worn it several times since then because she likes it so much. She says it's very comfortable, and the style really suits her. And, honestly, those polka dots are just adorable.


So the dress deserves a four-star rating for those positive points. But I can't give it five stars because there are some obvious quality issues - sloppy seamwork, low-quality fabric, and a belt so long that it wraps around my daughter's waist twice, making it virtually unusable (which is sad because it's the perfect style for this dress). None of this turns us off so much that my daughter won't wear the dress but enough that I can't give it perfect marks.


I know, I know...you get what you pay for, and at right around $25, this dress was a great price. So we turn a blind eye to the dress's imperfections and my girl happily wears it all over town (and gets compliments left and right). If you purchase the dress with the full understanding that this is not a Macy's-quality garment, then I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as my daughter does. But if you're picky about details and are looking for a more high-quality dress, then this one might disappoint you.


Great dress, the fit was a little loose but overly so. I received many compliments the day I wore it.


Adorable dress, but keep in mind - dry clean only. Though I'm honestly not sure how well it will launder.


I LOVE THIS DRESS, GREAT MATERIAL,FIT. OVERALL


Very very comfortable. I LOVE the dress. Fit for any occasion. Red was just right. I love the flow of the dress. Highly recommend. Thank youğŸ˜�


Way too small. pretty dress tho. nice cotton print with a full skirt.


XS - Fit me perfectly and was a HUGE hit!!


I weigh 120 lbs, 5'4" and very small chest


Better than I expected! I had doubts but I was pleasantly surprised. For $30 this dress is a must buy. It has spandex mixed in so it stretches a little in the snug areas for a perfect fit.


The dress was lovely, but the material was too plastic/papery to me. For the price I would have expected much better quality. Will be returning.


I like the dress. The fit is not what I expected. It's a little full, but I'm going to keep it.
