Love the dress the quality is excellent however the belt it comes with is a bit cheap compared to the dress but a quick fix!


Perfect fit and material is nice. Luv it.


A great little dress for my daughter. This was perfect for my daughters theater event.


Loved this dress, unfortunatly runs really big. I will order couple in different colors and patterns, in a smaller size.


I love the dress and its quality. I brought couple of GRACE KARIN dresses they all are pretty and worth the price


Dress fits great I followed the size chart


The dress is beautiful and very nice quality. Just not for someone who is tall or long waisted.


I was unable to zip up my dress all the way up. I was told the dress would fit as I ordered a size 2X to make room for my chest. Unfortunately it didn't work out.


This dress was just lovely. I wore it to my friend's wedding in Florida and received so many compliments!


Very nice dress.
