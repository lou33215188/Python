loved it


This dress flares at a weird spot.  The fabric was nice, however the flare and the cheap belt made me return this.


Poor quality of fabric. Feels more like cheap costume material. But it was cheap.


Although it was too small for me, the dress was very pretty and well made. It is also very stylish reminiscent to "I Love Lucy." If you wear a 3x, unless you have a small mid section, this might not be the dress for you.


This dress was absolutely perfect!


Bought this to wear to a wedding. The sizes fit just as expected. I am a 1x and this fit like a glove!


Fits perfect. Really cute!  I am 5'8", 172lbs and large fits perfectly.


Great dress! Would have liked it to have a U or V neck but this works perfectly!


Amazing! Bought two dresses size small and just look perfect :) very happy with my order! Most likely will be buying more very soon


Beautiful dress for the price!


Way too large. I'm 5'1 and the small went to my ankles
