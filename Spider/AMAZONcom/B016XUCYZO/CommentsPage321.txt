Absolutely stunning! Couldn't be happier, BUY IT!!!


Super cute, flattering cut, and I got loads of compliments on it.


beautiful dress!!! Bought it in size medium (i'm 5.3", 130 lbs) for a wedding and it fit perfect. Love the fabric and design. got so many compliments at the wedding.


They are very nice but the underarm area is a bit small.


This dress is beautiful.  The fabric is a nice weight.  I did order 1 size up because I am busty. Definitely worth the price.


My 16 year loves dressing in a conservative time period.  The dress was a lovely outfit for Easter.


Beautiful but was small. I wear medium or American size 12 but a large which was 12-14 was still small for me.
