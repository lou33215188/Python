I would suggest sizing up.  It is very tight and not very forgiving on size.  Otherwise we'll made and arrived on time!


Fit fine but the seam at the waist but a little too high


Beautiful dress I love it, a fit very nice I'm 5'3 and 170 I ordered large and it fit perfect.


Although I bought this dress over a month ago, I only had the opportunity to wear it last week. All day I received compliments and I felt like a million bucks! Can't wait to wear again and can't wait to order others.


Love it


Beautiful, fits nicely and comfortably.


The dress fit really well. I went up a size to 2xl. The arms were a little snug for me but other than that this was a great dress. I plan to buy more.


Love this dress. Wore to a wedding and got a lot of compliments. Looks just like the picture. Would definitely recommend any one of any size to purchase.


VERY PLEASED WITH THE FIT STYLE AND QUALITY OF THIS DRESS FOR THE PRICE.


 I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR 50'D STTLE DRESSES AND THE FITS THE BILL PERFECTLY


just as pretty in person.
