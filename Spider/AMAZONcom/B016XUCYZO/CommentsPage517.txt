Arrived 2 days early, fits perfectly and got lot of compliments.


This just makes you feel pretty...


Cute dress with great vintage style. Fits great and the cut is very flattering. Will definitely be buying more.


Love!!  Fits as expected. I usually wear small- the small fit perfectly.  I'm also 3 months pregnant and the stretch in the material is forgiving.


I wore a petticoat to make it fluff out more. I took the advice from an other review and swapped the belt out with a ribbon.


Love!


washed well. Fits perfectly. Got tons of compliments!


Poor quality. Very thin, zipper sticks, not lined and not made very good


Adorable dress for a 14 year old's Spring Fling Dance. The material is a good quality too. True to size.


My wife got it for graduation party and got compliments, need I say more.


Really cute nice fit.


Perfect fit. I have a big larger rib cage and wear a 32-34 C so the top was a little snug with a size small of this dress, but it still fit as expected. Very comfortable.
