I like the dress but, it does not fit!! I ordered a Medium and feels like Small size


This dress is so nice!


Material is on the thin side. You will need a slip for light colors but other than that... It's awesome! Love everything else about it


I purchased this dress for a 40's and 50's party and didn't expect much based on the low price. I was wrong, it is well made, great fabric, fits perfect (I wear size 6 and ordered a large) and will be wearing this to work. Would not hesitate to buy from this vendor again.


The dress fit perfect and it arrived in a timely manner.  I like my dress so much that I will purchase again in a different color.


I bought this dress because I had lost some weight and was really feeling myself. I cant lie I assumed it would be too small which would be ok since I'm in the process of losing more weight. But, when I put this dress on it was soooo cute and fitted my waist perfectly. I received so many compliments and will definitely be purchasing more. I got the 3x I normally wear a 1x to 2x


The dress is well made.  The style and pattern are very flattering.  I had been looking for a dress that does not cling and not revealing this dress is perfect.


I love this dress! It was a big too large so I returned it and got a smaller size. The return process was hassle-free.


This is a great quality dress for the price, and so versatile. I will wear it to work with a cardigan, and also out on the town with a petticoat and maryjane heels.


My daughter loves this dress


Such a cute dress.  I have a 37" bust so I ordered a L according to the chart.  It is a little tight in the chest but not badly. It looks cute on too.
