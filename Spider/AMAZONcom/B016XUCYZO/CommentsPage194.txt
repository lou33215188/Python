Super cute! The fabric better quality then anticipated. Fit like a glove. ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»


I have only tried this on. But, I love it! I can't wait to wear it out!


Loved this dress can be wore w or without belt and love the style and price! A winner for sure.


This dress only gets four stars because it was way too short. Im 5'9 and it went right in the middle of my knees. The material though is high quality! SOOO SOFT! The belt is cheapy. But the dress looks awesome on my smaller, and shorter, sister she's beautiful in it! So if you are 5'1 this dress will be the perfect length!


Great fit, just ordered another one


I bought this dress for a holiday party and loved it! I am a true size 3X and it fits amazingly. I highly suggest buying the petticoat to go under also, as it completes the look.


I LOVE this dress!!!  It is so flattering, and the fit was perfect.  I wear between a 14-16, and my bust is a 42 DD.  I ordered the 1X and it fit like a glove.


wore this dress for a tea party...got tons of compliments...based on the price its an excellent buy


This dress was adorable, but ran a little too small so I had to send it back. Unfortunately, a size up wouldn't work for me either, but the construction seemed nice and the colors were vibrant and lovely.


It came and I love it! It looks just as vibrant as in the picture. I bought it small to encourage myself to lose weight. But it fits me right now tho I have gained two pounds! So I think it runs  a bit big. I love this dress so much I am tempted to order another!
