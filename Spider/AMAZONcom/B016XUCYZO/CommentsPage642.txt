I'm always a little worried about the quality of dresses shipped from Asian countries, but this dress was just fantastic.  The material is very flow-y, and I think it's made of polyester so it won't shrink in the wash.  It hugs me in all the right places.  You'll have to get some tulle under the skirt if you want it to billow out like it does in the advertised photo.  I ordered a size "medium" and I am 5'5" and 128 lbs.


My only complaint about this dress is that it falls 2" below my knee, but a simple hemming job can fix this easily!

Absolutely LOVE this dress. Vintage wear is my absolute FAVORITE and this really hits the spot! Perfect length, good quality material, comfortable, and best of all washer safe! I won't take a star away even though there's a basic hiccup with this dress. I am a 36 DD (I ordered the dress in XL) and it's a bit tight on "the girls" when trying to zip up and the zipper catches on the track which; if you're alone may be a bit of a battle for you. However, I've found that pushing your shoulder blades together and getting an assistant to zip you works great! The material has a bit of a stretch so don't worry, you won't have loaf of bread boobs or underarm chafing. Anyhow, besides that bit I am super happy with the dress. It's so pretty and flowy I feel ready to go out and swing dance any time! Haha, exaggeration but I'm sure you get what I mean! I noticed the plethora of pattern and color choices as well. Ladies, look at the pictures... This dress is beautiful on all shapes and sizes. Treat yourself and take a chance with it, feel good, and feel gorgeous. Personally, I can't wait to get more!


This dress is very pretty and I will be wearing it to my next wedding or special event. The material has a little bit of a stretch to it however, if you are blessed with a large bust area I can see how this dress might not fit.  Also, the material seems to wrinkle easily and for those of you who are into low maintenance like I am, be warned that this dress is supposed to be dry cleaned. To be honest it feels a bit low quality (made in china), but for the price it's good enough.


I ordered 2 sizes up so ofcourse it was bigger for me then I'd like, but ultimately I love it and can take it in just a little fir a more fitted look.  I got plenty of compliments.  It was packaged greatly.  Definitely will by again!


I'm 5'6" and 130lbs, I bought the small, and it's perfect. Falls right on my knees and it's comfortably snug around my waist. I'm just a 34B, though, so I don't know how it would fit bigger girls in the top half.


I read other reviews that said the belt is way too long, so I was ready to trash the belt that came with it and substitute one of my own, but the belt was perfect! I'm a 27" waist and there is a lot of excess, but I know some reviewers cut it off. I don't mind tucking it under the belt behind my back.


The skirt is flatter than the picture makes it look. There's a lot of extra fabric down there when it lies straight down without a petticoat underneath. But the twirl in the skirt is SO worth it! I've never had a dress with such a cute spin! The fabric is heavy, seems durable, but it is a little see-through when you look closely. White or nude undergarments do the trick just fine.


It came packaged very neatly, but the dense fabric retained wrinkles from shipping. I hung it in the bathroom and steamed it out, and I think it got rid of most of the wrinkles. Also just wearing it and spinning in it helps!


Tip: I bought the white and black polka dotted dress, and some red suede pumps - 


 - to go with it! Very cute! I'm going to wear this outfit with a white floppy sun hat for Easter and my graduation party!


I LOVE this dress. It is so cute and has a cute pattern. I added the petticoat and it makes for a fun and fabulous party dress. I get compliments every time I wear. The skirt has great movement, and if you love to dance this dress, this is THE dress to wear. It has a sassy rockabilly 50's look to it so no one will have the same look as you.


BUY A SIZE SMALLER!!!!!!


First and foremost, I ordered this dress in a size medium. I wish that I had ordered a size small. The dress was a little too big on me overall the dress had ample room in the arms, the bust, and the waist area.


A little about my measurements to offer you girls (and possibly some guys, etc.) some perspective on how the dress fit a person with my shape and body:


*I am approximately 5â€™5.5â€�  ~ 5 feet and 5.5 inches  ~ (165-166 cm).


*At the time I had tried on this dress, I weighed somewhere from 130-140 pounds (my usual weight is 130-134 ish).


  ~~But, keep in mind that I was very bloated when I had tried on the dress due to some


  medication and monthly hormonal fluctuations that cause me to retain water and bloat


  up so badly that I cannot even fit into my normal jeans.~~


*I tend to gain weight around my hips, buttocks, and upper thigh regions.


*I have a naturally occurring hourglass figure, although it is not exaggerated


*My waist measures 25-26 inches


*My hips measure 33.5 inches


*Across the widest part of my butt, standing with my feet together, I measure 36 inches


*Under my bust, I measure 29-30 inches (depends on how accurately and precisely I take the measurement, typically it is 29.5 inches)


*Over my bust (meaning, measuring across the nipple), I measure 35 inches


*My torso is the longest part of my body and I have very stumpy legs, relative to the rest of my body


With that being said, because of the shape of this dress and it being too big and not being able to hug any part of my body where there are any curves, my entire body gets lost within the bulk of the dress, thereby making me looking much larger and less shapely than I actually am. The parts of my body that are exposed in this dress, meaning my arms and 2/3rds of my calves, appear to be much shorter than they actually are. Because of my body being lost in this dress and losing any semblance to a living human being, my arms and 2/3rds of my calves awkwardly poke out through the ample areas of the dress and also appear to be quite thick-like a resemblance of the dress.


In an effort to try to make the dress fit better, I tied the sash that it came with quite tight, but this did nothing except make a slight pull up past the lower portion of my rib cage. Since I have a relatively long torso, at least when compared to my legs, many dresses and shirts with the waist pulled in or a belt or sash that is supposed to tie and accentuate the waist do not work for me, since they are always up too high and  are instead pulled and or tied around my rib cage (maybe about 3-5 inches up on my ribcage, starting from my ribcageâ€™s lowest point). So, pulling in the dress to accentuate your waist is not going to work if you have a long torso. You could tie the sash elsewhere, but then you will be bypassing the stitched in sash loops and it will look a bit off, plus, the sash probably wonâ€™t hold as well as it would if it were threaded through the stitched in sash loops. So, I guess if you have a long torso like me, you may want to use the sash and accentuate your waist, but you will probably have to unstitch the built in sash loops and reposition them accordingly (a very easy fix and if youâ€™re afraid to attempt it, then take it to any tailor, it has always cost me less than $10 across major US cities from NYC to Butte to Orlando and more).


The dress was packed tightly in a waterproof plastic zip bag. But, when you take the dress out, it is quite wrinkly.


What I did to help get out most of the wrinkles (about 70% of the wrinkles came out doing this shower steam method) and what is pictured in this review, I hung it up on a corner hook in the bathroom so that the dress could hang freely and not bump any part of itself into a wall or door or whatever. And then I took a hot shower and steamed up the bathroom. I did not open a window or turn on the fan as I wanted to keep the steam in the bathroom. I showered for about 15 minutes or so, total. And then I got ready in the steamy bathroom, with no open windows or fans or even opening the door, for about 15 -20 or so minutes. Once I was done getting ready, the dress was about 70% less wrinkly than it was when I had taken it out of its packaging less than an hour before!


I was able to get about 90% of the wrinkles out of the dress by doing this same exact steam shower method and getting ready in the steam with the dress about 2 more times (it may have been 3) over the next 2-4 days hanging off of the hook, not bumping into anything. I suppose if I wanted to get out the remainder of the wrinkles (some of them were very deeply set), I would have to use an iron or take it to the cleaners for them to get it out with an actual steam cleaner to focus on the remainder of the wrinkles. But overall, 90% of them are gone using that steam shower method about 3 times total over 2-4 days.


When I wore the dress out in public to run some errands and to meet up with a good friend and an acquaintance for a quick bite to eat and then a drive through the country followed by a walk on the beach, a number of people complimented the dress (most compliments were about the color and how it reminded them of those old timey 50ish big poofy casual skirts) and  they only noticed the wrinkles when I asked them about the wrinkles.


Even though I had asked some of them directly about the wrinkles, after a moment of thought, every one of them said that it looked like a normal dayâ€™s wear and normal creasing just from wearing the dress and sitting down and doing stuff in it, but it didnâ€™t look bad and they would not have even noticed it if I had not pointed it out.

Thanks for reading my review. I hope parts of it were useful! Take care! (:


I didn't want to leave a bad review because I love the dress. It's beautiful, soft, and fits great. Unfortunately, the first time I wore it I noticed a large section in the front that looked like the fabric had a big run in it (about 6 inches long) right in the front and the fabric is already pilled. I think the dress is defective. I'd noticed the fabric was a bit dull (it wasn't with the first one I got) but didn't mind because I was so excited to wear it. I already threw away the packaging required to return it so I'm stuck with it. There was no section to contact the seller for them to fix this issue. The first dress I got (that I returned because it was the wrong size) didn't have this issue. The fabric looked more vibrant, not pilled at all, and there was definitely not a run in it.


First let me say that I ordered the 2X as it was closest to my measurements on the chart, and then ordered the 1X and kept the 1X. The 2X did fit, but it wasn't at flattering since it didn't cinch in my waist. I am a size 20/22 for pants and I think my waist size is 42". The bust is a bit big even in the 1X but not bad enough to require alterations. I love the length.


I also bought an XL petticoat from the same maker (Grace Karin) which was a little too tight and kept riding up but I loved the fluff it gave me anyway. The dress definitely stands out a lot more with the fluff underneath since the circle of the skirt is just massive. I only wore the ensemble for about 3 hours and I couldn't imagine how those 50s housewives could do it all day!


Unfortunately the dress was really creased when it came from being folded up for shipping. I spent about half an hour ironing it. I'm guessing I could have done it faster with higher heat but didn't want to take a chance.


On both sizes of the dress I ordered there were small issues with the threads on the hem. The 2X had a loooooong piece of thread that I'm glad I didn't have to deal with. The 1X had a bit of mis-stitching that you don't notice unless you're inspecting it.


The pattern is beautiful and the colors are so bright I absolutely love it. I can't wait to wear this dress again and I'm just thinking up times I can make it work.
