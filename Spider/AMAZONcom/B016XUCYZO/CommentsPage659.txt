Love, love love this.. I bought this dress in large size.. it fits perfectly. I am 5'10". The dress touches my knee.. I am so in love with the quality also.. it's cotton.. but not at all see through..


Slightly large however, I never measured myself based off of the measurements. I picked a 3x and is normally a 2x. Women that have a front belly due to pregnancy this is a wonderful dress. I would highly suggest buying a petticoat for underneath. It looks better that way. Very happy with the results and I never ever buy clothes online.


I love this Dress!


Apple-shaped body types... AKA, those who are looking to draw attention away from their thighs and backside.... As the dress is only fitted directly under the bust, it draws focus to the upper rib cage area, which is usually the slimmest part on a woman. This creates a flattering look on women who carry their weight in their lower body.


Very great material. I love it.


Love it.


A little larger in bust, but overall looks great on.


Love love love this dress! It fits perfectly. I'm on the shorter side ğŸ˜‰ And it hits me right below my knee so great length too!


I just got this and it fits me just right. My hubby loves it too!


Absolutely in love with this dress.  I live the way it flows and it's so very comfortable.  Love love love it!!


OMG I LOVE THIS DRESS SOOO MUCH!!! It fits so nice and it goes down to my knees! It's super beautiful too!


I'm still amazed that I could find such a modest, beautiful dress at such a reasonable price!


I'd love to have a closet full of these dresses!!!
