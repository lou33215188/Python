Beautiful dress. Comes to knee length. May need to go up a size. Fabric nice.


It was a big snug around my boobs but I  heavy chested. Had it altered. Besides that.... Perfect. Got loads of compliment .


The bust is small compared to the rest of the dress, but the measurements provided by the company were fairly accurate. Fabric is a decent weight and the length is great.


Love it but must buy the petty coat to achieve the full look


This is a beautiful dress and is exactly like the red one I purchase, just a different color. Same size ordered, however; the purple one was way shorter and I cannot wear it.


Beautiful dress that is so comfortable.  I love the color and design. It looks fantastic.  The black color is slightly shiny. I bought 2 that is how much I love it! Also wrinkle resistant which is amazing!


This dress is simply beautiful and comfy. I got it in my fav color. Maybe thatâ€™s why I love love itğŸ¤”ğŸ”¥ğŸ˜�


What a beautiful dress!


Love the dress! Im 5'4", comes right below the knees. Beautiful color. Petticoat was vacuum sealed in bag, which I thought was nice. Came with a thank you letter in bag. :) I will be ordering more Grace Karin dresses in the future.


I loved it!!! I was looking for something big girl friendly and man have I found it! It slims you down and hugs your curves all at the same time. When I got it I thought I might have ordered it too big but it fit PERFECTLY. I wore this with a red petticoat and it looked amazing!! I wore it to dapper day at Disneyland and to homecoming, definitely buying again!!
