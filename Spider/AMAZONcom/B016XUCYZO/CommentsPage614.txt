Very nice fit


Love, love, LOVE this dress!


I love it!!!


The material is great! Very thick cotton, like vintage dresses of the 50s used to have. It's well made, but the bodice part is slightly big on me. Hard to say how it would be on other people. I'm a size 6 and bought the medium because of other reviews. It was a good choice and easily tailored. The waist fits a little big high - and I'm 5'1. I'd definitely buy other clothes from them.


Loved it!


Love it, love it, love it!


Just perfect


I haven't tried the dress on, but the neckline and sleeves are very different from what is pictured. I liked the dress because of the neckline and sleeves. The one I received seems more like a wide strap tank top with scoop neckline. I'm not pleased.


Update: I tried the dress on. It's noting like the one pictured and I'm returning it. The belt was in the package. I just missed it.


This dress was beautiful.


Nice dress, expected fit, good quality material
