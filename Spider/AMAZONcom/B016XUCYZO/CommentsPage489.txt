I think it is sized small


I bought the black dress and it fits exactly right and looks exactly like the picture.


Poor construction.  The front darts we're uneven & material was not lined.


The dress is pretty true to size and I would definitely recommend to others.


I really like this dress. It's good quality and I love to colors.


Super cute in picture and Super cute on me too!


Super happy with my purchase!


Great dress


Bought this dress as a surprise for my wife without knowing her exact size. Without consulting her, I chose a small for her normal size 6 and it fits and looks great! She loves it!


Lovely!  Fit just right.  I'm 5'2" and 125 lbs.  Will buy this dress in other colors.


Absolutely loved this dress! I normally wear a size 16/18 in dresses or an XL and I got a 1x and it fit perfectly!
