Love it. Better than I expected. I received quite a few compliments.


The fit and the material are great!  Lovely dress!  I just wish it weren't 96% cotton and need some ironing after washing.


So many compliments!


I love this dress, I loved it so much I purchased another.


absolutely love this dress. I normally wear a large but I bought an extra large and it fit perfect....


I felt like Audrey Hepburn from the movie Sabrina. A classic piece.


I expected same quality as the vintage skirt from Grace Karin. This was somewhat lacking, wasn't as heavy or smooth as the skirt. Still a beautiful dress though.


This dress was perfect! The quality of the fabric and vibrancy of the color was exceptional. Grace Karin is officially one of my favourite sellers on Amazon now!


I wore this to my nephew's wedding. It fit well and looked nice.


Love the style of this dress. Can be worn plain or with a crinoline. Can be dressed up or worn casually  Fits as expected. Great price
