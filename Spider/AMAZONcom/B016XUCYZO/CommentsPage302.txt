The waist is too high, I need it to be one to two inches lower.  I tried to use a thick belt but it still not enough.  I think it's going back.


Great cut. I'm 5'10 and this dress hits me at mid-knee. Thinner fabric. Wear a slip underneath to fill out skirt.


Curvy girl was nervous about ordering this one- but I am THRILLED!!! Great quality for the price- turquoise color actually a lovely periwinkle shade.  Followed the measurement suggestions- and the L fit my 5'6" 165 lb frame perfectly.  I'm ordering it in a few different colors.  Go to summer dress!!!!


LOVE THIS DRESS!! Ordering more in other patterns!


This is the greatest dress at an unbeatable price!! Gorgeous fit, very classy style. I get compliments every time I wear it.


It fit exactly as it said it would. The material is good and the finish is good. Great buy. Thinking of rebuying in a different pattern as I love this type of style. Looking forward to wearing it.


Just beautiful!!


Very nice dress. It's for my daughter and with her measurements she was really close between the medium and the large, so we got the large. It has just enough room that it's not "too big" but she could still grow into it some.


I bought an XL. I usually don't buy clothing off the internet because they never fit but I was so happy  that it got perfectly. The fabric was a little thin and food Winkle very easily otherwise fantastic dress!


I absolutely LOVE this dress! I am a 40DD and size 16 in pants and I ordered a 1X and it is so flattering, I've gotten tons of compliments alrady. I'm going to order more! Perfect for going out or going to work!
