Second one I've purchased. Absolutely LOVE!!!


love it.


It's lovely and the bodice fits like a glove. The skirt is vrey feminine, and will make you want to twirl,...espiecially if you wear a crinoline under it!


My daughter wore this dance for a Spring Fling dance and it looked amazing.  Fit perfectly, good material, well made and arrived on time.


The dress is very fun and flirty!! very modest and I felt very pretty in the dress


Love it. Ordered another in a different color.


Beautiful


Fit ok. Looks great. Zipper could be better though.


I am buying this dress in every color. Amazing quality. Knee length. Fits like it was hemmed to my body.


Fits very well..
