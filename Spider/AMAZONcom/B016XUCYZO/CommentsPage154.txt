Loved this dress, I get a lot of compliments! ğŸ˜Š


This is the cutest dress and my daughter loves it so much that I have bought it in another color for her.


Love this dress. Fits perfect and I can't wait to wear it out!!


This dress is great! It is very full but is a nice thick material and very attractive!!!


Love these dresses. This is my second one! I went by my waist measurement I have an average bust size so it for perfectly. Ladies if you have a large bust go a size up.


I'm obsessed with this dress. Super flattering and comfortable. I already have it in 2 colors and I'm sure I'll get another. I wish the belt didn't have so much extra length to it, but the dress itself is great.


Stunning & I will be ordering from this designer again....fits true to size & has that lovely 50's vintage feel....highly recommend


Fits well and color good. Only issue plus the stitching near the chest area. Not smooth


I'm going to have to have it taken in, but I think it's a cute dress.  I went with the 4x as I am a 20-22 and I was allowing for some discrepancies in the size chart and actual fit, but it's several inches too big.  For the price, though, these are great dresses.


Simply beautiful.  I am always hesitant about ordering clothing online without being able to try it on but this was a true to size fit.  My daughter looked absolutely beautiful in it.
