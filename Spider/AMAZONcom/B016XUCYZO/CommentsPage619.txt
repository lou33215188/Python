I just got my dress and I'm thrilled.  It's quite snug but I don't want to go up a sizer because I'm sure it would be too big. I got the black dress and bought a fushcia petticoat to wear under it and it looks stunning. We're going on a cruise this month and this will be perfect for a formal dinner.


The dress is great, I like the quality of fabric and a belt, but the waist is too high and it doesn't look good on me, even though I am not tall - I am 5'6". I ordered size M it it was too big in waist, so if I would get size S the waist line probably will be even higher, so I am returning the dress. I think it will look good on shorter people.


The dress was too big for me. The top was shifting, the bottom part was too long and it overall looked weird on me. I was very excited for it and couldn't wait for it to arrive, but when I tried it on it was very long. It made me look shorter than I am and I'm 5 feet tall so the last thing I wanted. Sadly, I was very disappointed couldn't believe that it was so different because it looked really pretty in the pictures. Also, the belt is cheep and wouldn't even fit around my waist properly. Another thing is that the material is very thin and seems like the color will fade easily. I would advise you not to buy this and waste you time returning it.


I would give fewer stars if I could. I ordered this in one size and it was just a touch too tight.  No worries, prime item, send it back and get the next size up. Although the first dress matched the description, the second dress did not.  Cheap fabric, poorly made, different label, and SMALLER than the one I sent back.


Bought 3 dresses in a single transaction.  Two are AMAZING but this one is NOT the same fabric as others I purchased. It took forever and came from China.  Terrible thin fabric with frayed edges.


Over priced crapola


Absolutely love the two dresses I received from Grace Karin.  I am 5'6" and they posted hit below my knee which is exactly what I wanted.  I can't get over the quality of the dresses for the price.  I am looking forward to wearing these to special events this summer.


ADORE this dress! Makes me look thinner and very flattering!! Can't wait to wear it for Easter and my cousins wedding, thank you! ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼


I personally didn't like it on me. I don't like where the waistline sits. It hits above my natural waist and poofs out so much it made my butt and hips look HUGE. I sent it back. The quality is good, I just didn't like it on me. I am 5'5" and 130lbs


I am a 5'7..... 213 lbs woman and I wear a size 16-18 in jeans and a 38C in a bra. I'm not large and round around the mid-drift as I have a long torso. I ordered the floral white, with pink and purple flowers dress....and it was too big for me. At the size I am now, i needed a 1X maybe a size smaller than the 1X. I feel it would have been a better fit. The dress is pretty and is made of good material. It does not shrink much when washed either, I tried that, lol. I have no complaints, I just ordered a size too large. Hope this helps someone, because all the other reviews did not help me much.


Cute as can be! I'm a 16-18 with 40DD bust. I ordered the 3xl expecting to take the waist in some, if needed. Dress fits perfectly, if snug in the chest. I'd buy again in a heartbeat. The belt was included, though not needed, and fits with ample room.
