i did have to send it back but only because of the sizing. the fabric and color looked very nice.


The skirt of mine isn't quite even all the way around but otherwise I love this dress. Fits as expected, although there's no stretch at all to it.


I have Enmayer pumps to match and an Laura Ashley that sets this garment off. Very pleased and look forward to purchasing more of these retro classics.


I always wear an x small but this was too large


Love this dress! Make sure to buy the petticoat with it for a real beautiful look. So many people complimented the dress. I wore red heels and carried a red purse. I also wore a black bolero to cover my arms.  Stunning dress


Beautiful!!! I wear a size 14 (five feet 3inches tall), I bought an XL it fits nice. I Could have been able to wear the Large considering the space left in the dress. The material has a stretch to it. Personally,  this dress can be worn with or without a petticoat. I love it!!


5'3"/140/32D. I usually wear small/medium or 4/6 dresses. I bought this same dress in a pattern in small and it's slightly too small at the arms. Medium is great! Slightly large at the neck and gaps, but with good posture it's fine.


the color was off for me, and the size was too big.  I am 5'4, 170lbs


Beautiful dress!!! I made the mistake of getting the wrong size for my daughter but she loves this dress!!! Wonderful quality and price!!!!


Some what small around the bust
