I wear a small normally, but order a medium because of past experiences. Well, this dress is too big. I really like the dress and will keep it

I ordered a size too big. I always do, then I take it to the tailor.


Well made beautiful rendition,  you won't be dissatisfied.


Fabric is very thin, but the print is very pretty. May wear as a tea dress, but length is just below knee not mid calf.


Fun vintage dress! Great price and fantastic swing to the material. The belt is cheap (I'd recommend replacing it) and the dress is not lined, but the fabric is thick enough that it is not transparent. For $30 it is a great deal!


So cute and flattering. Perfect for work or date night. Very versatile. Comfortable and feminine.


Loved this!!!


This dress fit and the colors in it are brighter then they appear online, which is a PLUS!!

Love love love this dress! Beautiful and fits perfectly. I'm 5'3 140 pounds and normally wear medium but after reading reviews I chose to go up to a large. The dress is very lightweight and flowy.
