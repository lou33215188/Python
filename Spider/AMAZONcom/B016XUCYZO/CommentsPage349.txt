Good quality, washed nicely.  Fit as expected.


I bought the black dress with cherries.  It was for a 50s party.  The dress is super cute and fits very nicely, as the fitting chart describes.  Very good find for a great price!


This dress is so cute and fit perfectly according to the size chart. It's made of a high quality sateen fabric with a weighty feel so it drapes nicely. I would highly recommend this dress for anyone looking for a 50's retro look, without having to scour vintage shops.


I love this product it fits great. Beautiful dress.


It's absolutely perfect!!Like many others, I'm obsessed with this dress and plan to buy another! Fit is perfect!


Gorgeous dress, and I get so many compliments! It was ever-so-slightly smaller in the waist than I'd expected, but nothing a little spanx can't help with. Works great with or without a petticoat underneath. I want all the colors!!


Only negative thing I have to say about the dress is the zipper .. where it starts at is horrible you have to fight it over the hump where the waistline starts


LOVE this dress.  Can't wait for it to get warm enough to wear it.  I'm 5'2" and about 125 lbs and the medium fits perfectly for me.  I also got a petticoat and love how it looks with it.


Cute simple black dress.


I was surprised by how cheap the fabric and design look in person, but I love how the dress flares at the bottom and it is very comfortable, even with a petty coat.
