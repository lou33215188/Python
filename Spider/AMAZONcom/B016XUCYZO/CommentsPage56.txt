In love already. Being a bit overweight, I have to watch what I wear, but I trusted fellow reviewers on this one and sure enough - I love it. Pros - it's beautiful and durable. The belt is a velvet which makes contrast nice. You can accessorize it any way you want! (Oh, and I did do the 'twirl' as soon as I put it on - of course) The cons - It's a bit short for my torso and I'll actually have to break out the iron. For those looking for measurements: 190 lbs, 5'7", 38 bust - I got xl and it's just the slightest bit large.


This dress is a Chinese knock off of the dress in the photo. I'm 5'7" 136lbs long and lean. Usually dresses like this fit in the waist but won't zip up my back. The large has a 30/31" waist and is not binding on my 30" waist and very form fitting around my 38" bust,(actually my back is very athletic and my boobs are average).It is the best fit I've found in a dress in years. The woven fabric has a bit of stretch. Very good quality for the price. I got the red with the black polka dots.  The dots are larger that in the photo and the skirt isn't as long as pictured. I just ordered a light blue with white pin dots.


I got this on Prime Day and I'm really happy I did! The skirt is super full, but it's fun and twirly. For some reason it says dry clean only on the tag, but I've washed it on cold in my machine twice and had no issues. The belt is pretty annoying (it just won't stay in the little guide spot on the side of the dress, so its always dangling weirdly), so I just leave it off. Also, I ordered a large based on my measurements (bust 37, waist 31.5, hips 39) and it's a bit big, but not too big to wear.


I was very surprised at the quality of this dress given the reviews it got. I expected a much cheaper material but it is actually sewn with somewhat of a thick cotton like (most likely a polyester blend) material. It fit as I expected it to fit, just slightly larger than my actual size (I'm 5'4, 115 lbs) and I bought a small. It's larger at the waist because it hits higher for the flare at the bottom. I would suggest buying a petticoat to go underneath but it is still very cute without one. Overall, I am satisfied with the make and wear of the dress.


Okay. Let me start by saying I have a huge fear of ordering clothes online and I have an even bigger fear of ordering dresses online that are fitted through the ribs with no stretch. I have been disappointed so many times before online and in store. But...This. Dress. Fits. Perfectly. I went up a size but I really think I might be able to order my size next time because oh yeah, there's gonna be a next time! I cannot be more thrilled. It looks good with or without a petticoat. I'm 5"2' and it hits me mid-calf, which again, perfect. I just...I'm so excited! Thank you Grace Karin.


Love this dress.  Nice weight fabric and it felt nice on.  I usually wear a size 16; 38D VS bra.  This was too big, but I totally love it, so will reorder a size XL.  Hopefully that will fit better.  When i tried it on, i definitely thought it would benefit from a petticoat.  Have one ordered, but has not yet arrived.


After reading reviews for days I finally bit the bullet and ordered it - I am so glad I did! The classic style of the dress is so flattering on all body types. I got the petticoat to wear under it and that kicked the dress up to showstopper level! I am a normal size 14/15, 5'8 &185lb, small C and the size Xl fit like a dream. I will be getting this dress in several other patterns. If you're not sure about ordering this,  JUST DO IT!


Beautiful dress.  The belt buckle did break off when I was trying to get the plastic off of it, so that is not the highest quality. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  I'm hoping to be able to ordered another belt.  Otherwise,  great quality and fits well. I'm excited to wear this dress.


This dress is adorable. I am 5'2'' 150 pounds ( I hold it mostly in my stomach) and I purchased a medium. It flatters my figure perfectly. The zipper is a little stiff and small but it works. The arm holes are slightly too small and uncomfortable after a long day. I think it's mostly because of the tough fabric but the fabric is lovely otherwise. When I received it, it was wrinkled quite badly so I washed and dried it (I refuse to dry clean). Afterwards it was much smoother but the pleats were a lot less distinguished, as expected. I plan on purchasing a petticoat to wear with it but it works well without it. For the price, this product is great.
