I LOVE the way this dress fits and the material is very comfortable. I received so many compliments. Definitely happy about the purchase!


I love this dress!!! I am 5"8, 120 pounds and I wear a D cup and I found that the extra small was PERFECT. My only struggle with this size was that it was hard to get it past my chest while wearing a bra. I got it for dapper day at Disneyland and I thought the pink and purple floral pattern would be perfect for my Cheshire cat theme, and it is. I got a slip because without one, I will admit it had NO poof on its own. The material is nice and thick so no undies showing through and the dress feels like a nice white shirt with starch, if that's helpful, so it might feel scratchy to some but its worth it! I'm a tall girl I would say and its still a nice modest dress. I found that is can be a little frumpy in the neckline, like its loose but its definetly not a deciding factor on whether not to buy this dress.


I reccomend it to anyone on the fence about it because it is an awesome, well-made, vintage little dress that goes with every occasion.


I ordered this dress for a Audrey Hepburn themed bridal shower. I love this dress! It fit fantastic and was very comfortable. I ordered 2, one for my daughter and 1 for myself, we got so many compliments.  I would definitely order this dress again. I am even thinking about ordering another dress in a different color.


This red with black polka dots is gorgeous. The fabric is great and has just a touch of stretch to it. Easy cold water wash and line dry.


Just be very careful of ordering dresses from this page. Be sure they say Grace Karin and fulfilled by Amazon. Watch because each color differs. The black with white polka dots was listed as Grace Karin but fulfilled by some CHIC GIRL OR Orange Red company that is actually in China and they were not nice when I needed to return the black with white polka dots as the fabric was worn looking and awful. Amazon I must say took charge of the issue and showed me they truly care for their customers. They refunded me. So in the end if I was to order any of the Grace Karin dresses from the 5 I have seen I would order just these.  Red with black polka dots, black with pink, yellow and purple flowers, white with pink and purple floral print and the black with fuchsia polka dots. I am kind of a freak, when I find something that I like and the fit is great I order one in every color so I have exactly what I want. This taught me to be careful and to READ everything. I do so appreciate Amazon for putting value on me as their customer and helping me find resolution with the one dress that was sub-par.


Fits very well! Wore to a wedding and ended up actually jumping into the puget sound in it multiple times thar night! I though for sure that the ocean water was going to have an affect on it. Took it to the dry cleaners after my little adventure and it still looks brand new!!! Love this dress!!! Such great quality and beautiful!


This dress is completely precious. Bought it for my 14 yo daughter (5'1", 130, 37-29-36, sz M)


Was a little surprised that packaging said "dry clean only" and "no prolonged sun exposure".


No care tag in the dress itself. Ironed well on cotton steam setting.


We purchased the Grace Karin Crinoline for underneath. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B011RJ0048/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_19


Perfect look!


Absolutely loved the dress!  I got so many compliments. I am 5'4/180, 38DD, I wear size 10-12 or Large. I looked at the reviews and ordered a size up due to my chest size and not wanting it to be too tight. I ordered the petticoat also and OMG just made it look even better. I ordered another one and have 2 more in my cart. Must buy!!!


This dress is so flattering and beautiful, it has flare even without any help. The colors are gorgeous, the material is strong and silky, and it so comfortable. I can't believe it was only 30 dollars. (The quality rivals that of an 80 dollar dress.) Hands down my favorite dress. Perfect for Spring and makes me feel so light and shapely. Even with all my rolls and lumps, this dress makes me look slim and full-figured. I am 5'7", 250 pounds, so I at first bought size 2X Plus, but returned it and got a size smaller. 1X plus fit wonderfully.


Wow! What a beautiful dress. I bought this for my sister's 30th birthday. It arrived right on time and fit her perfectly. ğŸ�‹ğŸŒ¼ğŸ’›ğŸ”† This is a size small. We also bought a 25" black petticoat.


this dress was a perfect fit and hung very well on my daughter.  she loved it and received many compliments at graduation


paired with "Retro Dress Rockabilly Petticoat"
