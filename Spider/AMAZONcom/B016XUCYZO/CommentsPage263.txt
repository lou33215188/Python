This dress is so cute and fits perfectly!!! I would recommend it for anyone! I wear a size 12 and got the large. Perfect!!


Gorgeous dress - absolutely love it! But it is slightly bigger than expected!


It is totally as expected. And I love wearing this. Very cool for summer nights!


Fits like the black one I brought perfect soft material and pretty design.  Nice for a reception or summer.  Love it


Very simple and light with single layer fabric. Beautiful to look at. It's a little larger than expected. Bought it for an occasion a week ago and couldn't use it. Need to be adjusted before I can wear it.


I give this a 3. Even though its a beatiful dress with good quality , it runs way too big. Dont order according to measurements. Rather stick to size. I ordered 3 X plus and i am 100kg and 44 DDDIt is twice my size. Way too big.


I love everything about this dress, the print, the colors, the material and the fit. It's just so pretty! I'll just need a lil help with the zipper though since I can't reach behind me low enough to fully get the zipper up.


Pretty. My husband loves this dress. It has a lot of material and is somewhat scratchy.


This dress was awesome and fit so well. The problem arose when it rained at the event I wore it to and the red dye ran all over the white.


Lots of compliments. Love this dress.
