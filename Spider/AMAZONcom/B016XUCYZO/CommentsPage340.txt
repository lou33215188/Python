love it


Was exactly what my niece wanted and she looked amazing.


I loved this dress and have been recommending it to everyone.  I was shocked with how well it was made and felt.  There was just enough stretch to it to make it very easy and comfortable to wear,.


Absolutely love that dress! I ordered a petticoat with it and got a ton of compliments! The only thing I didn’t like is that the belt didn’t have holes punched in it.


Wife loved it


This dress fit perfectly and I was quite surprised at the great quality of the material, belt, and zipper. I’m definitely going to buy more of these dresses!


I love this dress! I paired it with a petticoat for a classic look. Received tons of compliments!


beautiful dress but fit too small. go one size up.


I wore this dress for my college graduation and got compliments on it all day! This fabric is a bit rough. Despite being white it wasn't see-through at all. Highly recommended!


Good
