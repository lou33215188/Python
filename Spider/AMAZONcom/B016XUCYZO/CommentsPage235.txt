THIS PRODUCT WAS A LITTLE LARGE ON ME, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO CONSIDER IT A MANUFACTURER/SELLER MISTAKE. I AM VERY SMALL ANS USUALLY WEAR AN X-SMALL, BUT THIS DRESS STILL LOOKED AMAZING FOR MY BROTHERS WEDDING. THANK YOU!!!!


This dress was better quality than I expected. I'm about a size 6-8 and usually wear a medium. I ordered a medium and it fit well, although because it was just a little looser than I hoped it would. Still the dress is beautiful and I got many compliments when I wore it. I would purchase again in another color.


Beautiful dress, great quality!


True to size!! I read some comments that it ran small and ordered a size up, inly to have to exchange it for a smaller one.


Bought this dress for my sister n sent it to her as a Christmas gift in 2016. She says she gets alot of compliments about the fit, style and pattern. She absolutely loves it


I’m small on top so the large size dress works for me. If anyone is on the larger side on top it maybe a very snug fit.


I expected the dress to be less stiff material-wise, and even after following the sizing chart provised, the bust is still too small for me, but aside from that, it's a very nice dress, and having bought the white one with floral, it's remarkably not see-through. Shipping and delivery was also very quick and painless.


Great quality.. I love this dress twice for myself once for my daughter


Love this dress!


LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this dress... Beautiful color and super classy... Will definitely buy more colors


I was surprised by how much I liked this dress. Nice quality, fits as expected, and is very flattering to my figure. I wear size 8 pants and ordered a medium. It falls just to my knees (I’m 5’5.5”). I will probably be ordering this again in an additional color.
