This just came in today and I'm SO excited! IF YOU USE THE MEASUREMENT GUIDE it fits perfectly (I'm 5'4, size 16+) ! I never buy clothes online, but thought I'd give this a shot. Normally I buy my dresses from Dress Barn or similar for work. Quality is the same, but price is far better & more fabrics to choose from. LOVE THIS. Will be ordering in additional patterns.


fits nicely and looks like the image


For the price, very cute dress. Made well. Fit as expected on sellers size chart.


Great dress however it was way to big. I ordered up due to reviews and I shouldn't have, it's being returned. I'll order another one size smaller than my original order for sure.


This is a great dress for the price. I'm buying more in different colors. The dress is figure flattering and looks great with the black petticoat I bought separately. I weigh about 220 pounds and an 5'7" so I was very worried the dress would be too short, too small, too tight, and poorly made. But I'm pleasantly surprised that it fit and doesn't look cheap!


I love this dress. Don't order too large. What you'de normally wear is what you should order. I'm 5'6 " and 240lbs with a large chest. a 2x fit perfectly.


Pretty dress, but I can't zip it up the last few inches past my shoulder blades. This will have to be returned.


LOVED IT. Wore it for engagement photos and received many compliments.


Only needs a good ironing. True to size chart. Great purchase


The material is thick and feels extremely durable! Order your true size, I am between a 10 and 12 in pants so to be safe I ordered the large and it fits, definitely would not have fit the 12. I do plan to order more! Love love!
