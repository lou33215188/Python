My daughter is in love with this durable looking, but comfortable dress.  It is hard to find a good fit for a 14 year-old.  We will definitely buy one again in future!


Very classy, timeless dress...:)


It fit amazingly and I just ordered my normal size with out measuring myself, so it's very true to size. It looks great on and I would highly recommend this dress if you need a 50s dress to get the brand!ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š


I loved the dress, it was a little big I usually wear a 12-14 regular in dresses and thought it would transfer well to a Large but I should have gone for a medium. The dress is tea length, I'll have to get it hemmed shorted


Fit perfectly. Well pleased. Many compliments.


Good quality


Came so quick. Great quality and accurate sizinh


Very classy look that can be dressed up or down.


Perfect fit. XL for 36D, 5'6".


Cute fits great!! Some of the dots not lining up sets off my OCD but nothing a black fabric pen can't fix.
