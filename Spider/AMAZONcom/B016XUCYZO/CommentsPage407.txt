Beautiful dress! Nicely made.very flattering.


Tried it on as soon as got it and it fit perfect and loved all the colors on it.  Wore for a wedding I attended and received many complements.


I have 3 of these dresses so far and I plan to buy a couple more patterns when they come back in stock! So pretty! The belt is useless, way too long and very cheaply made but otherwise these are a great purchase.


It's a little tight getting the zipper up where the waist seam comes together.  Tear drop zipper is weak, so have to be careful when zipping. Otherwise, it's a beautiful dress.


The dress is beautiful and just what I expected but it did come in larger than I had anticipated I'm going to have to have it taken in


ADORE this dress!  It fits perfectly, and is just the right length.  I Do recommend the petticoat underneath if you purchase this one - just the right touch!


Gorgeous! Wore with a petticoat to make it pop!


The dress is gorgeous. Only flaw is the tag was literally sewn into the seam. That's ridiculous. Other then that I would buy another. Or one of each color.


This dress is a dream come true. Perfect fit, beautiful fabric, amazing pattern. I want to wear it everywhere.


Beautiful! Good fit. I'm 5ft and 112lbs and I got a small. Slightly large around shoulders but not large enough that I wouldn't wear it or change the size.
