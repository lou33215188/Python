Cute dress! Fabric weight is substantial enough to have a nice drape.


I was so excited about this dress. The fabric is awesome but the fit was weird. I have a pretty proportionate body but it just didn't look right.


Amazing dress for the money and it looks like a dream! Love it! If you are a plus size girl, make sure you only buy plus size dresses from this brand. Not all styles come in the larger sizes.


My girlfreind loved this dress! She is somewhat thin/average about 5-8 and the small fit her nicely.


Love the dress not quite large enough to zip because of my bust line. If I had gotten a larger size it would not have fit any where else.


The dress was just what I expected.  It was a little large around the waist (I got an XL because my waist was 1" too large for the Large according to the sizing chart), but was able to cinch the belt without any bunching.  I may take it in a little before wearing it gain.  I got many compliments and felt very beautiful.  The material was easy to iron.  Overall, worth the price.


I'm pretty broad backed so the zipper pulls just a bit. The cut is the right length and is cute on my body. I defined the waist with a brightly colored belt. Several compliments thus far.


Beautiful dress


The dress fit me everywhere but the neckline. I am going to take this to a seamstress and see if they can fix the dress. If they tell me they can't I will be returning it.


Happy with my purchase! Good fabric, very cute pattern a high scoop neck and great flair to the skirt of the dress. Order 4 in total.
