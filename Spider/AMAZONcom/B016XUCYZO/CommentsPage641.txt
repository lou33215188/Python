Nothing less than amazing ğŸ˜€


I'm 5'4" and 117 pounds! This dress is a small and not tight! It's super cute! Sorry I'm not wearing the belt! But it's my new favorite dress!


To start, I received the dress a lot sooner than I had expected, which was a wonderful surprise!


When I opened the bag that the dress came in and tried it on, I was only slightly disappointed with it. The belt is way to big so you definitely have to buy a new one. As for the dress itself, the material is strange but it should be alright and it leaves a bunch of lines (I.e. Extremely wrinkly). I'm hoping once I wash, dry, and iron it that it will be much better!


Overall, I love it though. I thought the red would be cute for winter and I was right! It's flattering and adorable.


I'm a tall girl so it's a little above my knees, as seen in the picture.


I highly recommend it though, it's most certainly something to buy!


cute cute


Bought this polka dot dress and the material was not as shown in the picture. Had bought the flowered one as seen in the pics before and it was beautiful but i was very disappointed with the polka dot one. It fit very well however but the material was not a very good quality..


Great dress!!! I am 5'5 167 lb usually wear medium ordered this in large and it fits just perfect! Great quality, great style dress. Will be buying more colors


Ordered for my daughter to wear to a homecoming dance. Ordered the size based on the measurement chart. It is nice heavy-weight fabric that lays nicely. Belt was horrible, just as expected from previous reviews. . . so we ordered a high waist leather belt from Amazon and it worked perfectly.  For the dance we also included a tulle slip for volume!


I ordered a size L..I'm a size 12-14 fits a little snug...but can zip all the way up, I rate it a four cause I ordered it without buying a petricoat:( You can tell when you put it on that it's made for a petticoat to be under. So I will definitely be buying one. But other than that, it's shiny just like the pic shows, and the colors are vibrant and beautiful :)


I'm 5'6, 180 lbs, and a size 14. I ordered an XL based on the size chart and it fit exactly as expected. It falls below my knees (no petticoat).


Pros: The thick material and cut of the dress easily hides problem stomach areas. It's a very well made dress. I ordered the red and love the color. No problems with the zipper, and it is nicely hidden. Very comfortable and classy.


Cons: Did not come with a belt as stated in the description, and it looks very plain without one. Wash instructions are a little unclear - in the description it says to hand wash, but on the tag that came with the dress it says to dry clean. I guess that means you can do either?


LOVE this dress! I receive so many compliments every time I wear it. I did buy a petticoat to wear underneath and it does add a bit of flair to the dress.
