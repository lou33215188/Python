Bought this for our daughter. It was too big--so we returned and ordered a small which fits her nicely. She loves it, but has only worn it once. We added crinoline petticoats, a white belt, white shoes, and a white sweater to complete the look.


Lovely dress. The fabric is very nice and sturdy. It does seem to pick up everything though. It helps to have a lint roller handy. I do wish the little belt it comes with had a little ring to slide the excess side into, but a very minor thing.


I was pleasantly surprised at how this dress fit and looked. I was close to buying a dress almost identical to this one that was $80. At $30, this dress is a steal. I followed the chart and ordered the XL. It fit me perfectly. I am 5'3", so it is a tad longer than I would like it to be. I'll probably hem it so it is at knee length. Overall, I'd say this dress is a win!


Great dress, I got so many compliments when I wore it! I am a curvy woman, usually wear size 6-8 and have larger thighs and bum with a small waist and 34 C chest.  I bought a medium and it fit me wonderfully, even two months post-partum. the material is nice and heavy and doesn't wrinkle easily. It washes well too.


I would definitely encourage you to wear this with a petticoat in order to achieve the fuller effect you see in the photos.


This dress fits your true size!  I usually buy tops in medium or large. My jeans size is an 8. I'm 5'2" 147 lbs with a 36DD and I ordered a large - it fits perfectly.  I purchased the white with black polka dots- very vintage!  The belt secures at the small of your upper waist & creates the perfect shape. I also purchased the same designer crinoline tutu in black to fan the dress out a bit. I'd recommend getting it-


Wonderful material- light yet solid.  I just purchased another in black.  Great cocktail or brunch dress!


Pretty well made, light weight summer dress with a beautiful pattern, that was well priced, came well packaged and arrived on time. This is the 2nd one I've purchased. I will definitely be back for more!ğŸ’•ğŸ‘—


I normally am a 16 or xlarge but after reading the reviews I ordered the 1x and it fit perfectly this dress is beautiful well made looks just like the picture, fabric is good quality glad I bought it.


Came on time and packaged carefully(due to size and cotton content will need just a little ironing)It is beautiful and fits perfectly.Now All I need is a shrug that matches my blue shoes and everything is all set.


This dress was absolutely perfect for my daughter to wear to the spring Fireman's Dinner, (we added a black net crinoline to give it some body) and she loved it. The fabric is cotton with a nice brushed sheen, the zipper is well set, and the dress matches the sizing chart perfectly. The included belt was very very long, I trimmed it. Otherwise no complaints whatsoever.


The style of this dress is pretty, but the material is definitely not cotton and I wouldn't have bought it had I seen it in person.  I noticed in reading reviews after the fact, that there are a number of different dresses under this same item, so depending upon which style dress you order, apparently determines the size, quality, material, etc.
