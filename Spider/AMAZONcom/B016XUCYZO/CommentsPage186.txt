Grace Karin is quickly filling my closet and becoming my new go to. I have at least 10 dresses from them and everything fits perfectly with a modest length that allows me to wear it to work or the elementary school I help in. The cut is flattering and the color and print is always what is shown in the picture. Trust me, you cannot go wrong with a Grace Karin dress.


Love love love !!


This probably is my first review Coz I usually never write reviews. The dress got delivered this afternoon, after trying on I felt amazing. The fit was exactly what I was looking for. I ordered a medium and I did received what I ordered. Coming to the cloth, I found it great. The cloth doesn't looks like a cheap one at all Infact the quality was great. And I liked the belt too. Just that u need to adjust it a bit. Great product for reasonable price. I'm gonna order few more colours.


It fits everywhere except in the length is to short


Wow, what a great find. The fabric feels very nice, the colors are bright and most importantly, it feels and looks good to wear!


I’m 5’5” and around 155-160 and the medium fits perfect!! It’s has some stretch too!


I LOVE this dress. I ordered a 3X to be on the safe side, but should have ordered a 2X as the top part of the dress fit big. I camouflaged it with a belt and shrug. I wore this to a red carpet event at a Family Reunion, and wow'd the crowd.


I love this dress. It fits well with a little give to it. I have a petticoat to wear underneath for a bit of poof.


This dress is husband-approved! I am 5'6", 132 lbs. and ordered a size M in the red w/black polka dots, and it is so cute!  I also bought a black petticoat to go under and that looks so pretty and dresses it up a bit too.  I would definitely buy another color of this dress in the future!


A lot smaller then described and too short


it's very beautiful dress and very nice color and the quality of the cloth is very good i like it
