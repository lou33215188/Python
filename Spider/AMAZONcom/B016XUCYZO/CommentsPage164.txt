I ordered based on my actual measurements and it was huge. Very cute dress and well made.


It looks nice but it was not very flattering.  And it did run somewhat small.


Love it


I needed a dress for my son in laws graduation from the police academy. I wanted a classy little black dress that I could add a royal blue belt to. I'm always cautious when buying online.


This dress was not only delivered as promised but fit perfectly according to the size chart. I'm going to see what other colors it comes in and buy more.


This dress is absolutely beautiful! It's a good bargain for a low price, and so far it seems to be of great quality. The skirt is poofy by itself, but I also bought a petticoat to go with it, and it gives it a nice layer of 'poomf' underneath! My usual test for a good fluffy skirt is to spin in it, and spinning in this dress makes me feel like a princess. Highly recommend!


I loved this dress! It's a little too big at the top, but not too much where I think I needed to go down a size. I did size up after reading all the reviews.


I loved my dress ! I'm 5f 7inch 185lbs and I ordered a extra large and it fits well beleave i could have fit a medium also. I would buy this dress again in a different color! I recieved a lot of complements , love the checker patern it was something different from the topical polca dots! ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜˜


I absolutely love my dress. What I love most about this purchase is the product was exactly as the picture shown. The color is vibrant and I did purchase another dress within two days of receiving my first one. I cannot wait to wear it and  will post a picture.


The size wasn't actually the problem, it was more where the waist hit me and the length of the dress.  The waist hit right underneath my breasts-- not flattering.  The skirt hit above my knee and I'm 5'6.  I returned.


Absolutely love it!! Fits perfectly, is well made and extremely flattering! I will buy more of this dress in other colors and patterns.
