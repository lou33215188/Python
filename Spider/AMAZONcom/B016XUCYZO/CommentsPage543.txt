Love it.


I like it but it's to short


I love this dress. It fits great and looks even better with a petticoat.


BEAUTIFUL! 145 lbs. 5'4", a L will fit perfectly! Just like Audrey Hepburn â™¡


Thick, sturdy, soft fabric.


This looks just as in the picture. The fabric is soft and strong. This is so pretty!!!!


I bought this dress for my daughter's  semi-formal  dance.  She loves it, and can't  wait to wear to the dance.


Great quality!  Construction is top notch.  Will definitely be ordering again!


Looked like picture, but a little less shiny.


The dress or the fabric I should say was a bit loose around my boobs and at the neck the belt is kinda cheap but other wise I love it!!!


I like the Fit and colors
