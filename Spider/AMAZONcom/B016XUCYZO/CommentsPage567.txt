I bought this for my daughter and she loved it! she took pictures for me and it is beautiful! Perfect for a night out or just a nice dinner. I highly recommend this dress in red. Perfect fit and very comfortable to wear. I also love the belt!


Very pretty dress happy with it


Fit perfectly and looked very similar to the pictures online! I absolutely love this dress and it was a great dress for the occasion I needed it for!


Fits as expected. Love


Very flattering and comfortable!


The belt went around me twice and the bodice of the dress stopped much shorter than expected.


I love this dress!!!!!


A little lady bug-ish, but I love this dress.


I didn't expect it to fit as good as it does


Fits very well and looks great when paired with a petticoat
