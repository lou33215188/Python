Love this dress. Itâ€™s very classy & fits great.


Perfect! Great quality! Fits just as expected!!


I ordered this dress in a medium and it fits perfectly!  Extra cute with a petticoat underneath (sold separately). I would definitely purchase again in another color/ pattern.  I received so many compliments.


The torso weidth is just fine, but I have a short torso length...so I have to get that adjusted to fit me without the flare ups. The dress itself is made with good materials and finely sew. It's mostly for people with longer body lol but I still like it.


5'2' 165 lbs, 38DD chest, XL fit PERFECT. Great material, and completely happy with this purchase. Belt didn't have any pre-punched holes, but wasn't planning on wearing that belt anyway. Got many compliments on it at my bridal shower.


Love the dress and it fit.  Well made and light weight material. It arrived a full month earlier than quoted. Happy with the purchase.


Super cute but you need the netted skirt for it to fit properly, snags super easy


Beautiful dress especially with the petticoat


The dress is wonderful . I am size 22-24 and 48 ddd and the dress was great. Size 4x was ordered.


I wore this dress to my grandparents 50th anniversary party and it was a real eye catcher.  I am 5'6 177 lbs and I purchased a large and the fit was excellent and I loved the price. You definitely want purchase an underskirt to add volume and personality to the dress.
