I love this dress.  Feels durable and very comfy! I think I might get a thicker belt but overall I could not ask for more!


This dress WAS amazing, after trying it on once, when I went to wear it a week later, the zipper completely broke apart. SO DISAPPOINTED


The only problem I had is that it runs large. I purchased a extra large according to the size chart but the dress is gaping all around. I am returning for a medium and hoping it fits better as the material has some stretch. This was purchased on my father's account.


Love this dress so much I had my bridesmaids get it in black for my wedding!


I put 2 on these tooth brushes I only got 1


it's a little big but gorgeous and i'll have it taken in


ABSOLUTELY LOVE this


Overall beautiful dress , but for an XL is way too small ..
