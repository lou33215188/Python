Looks great on and the fabric is nice. Not cheap feeling at all. The belt is a little long but not a deal breaker.


Lovely! I am a plus size girl and was worried how it might fit, but it looks great!


Love love love looks great, I’m a bigger girl (200p 5”11)and got the XL it fit perfectly and went down to my knees! I get a lot of compliments on this one!


I recommend this dress


Excellent quality, will be purchasing more in other prints.  Material is thick and soft, really surprisingly good quality.


I was super sad that this did not fit,  but I'm also disappointed because it did not have the belt with it. I hope this doesnt effect my return!


love this dress!!! Beautiful quality!

Cute!  Just didn't look good on me!


My daughter got this for a school dance and it was perfect. Fit as expected, no issues at all. Thank you!
