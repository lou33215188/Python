Nice quality material and style. Fit great and looks awesome.


Pretty, and nice, but a little shorter than I though it would be. Bought for daughter and she's tall, 5'10'' and this was a bit short for her. Cute dress though.  She's keeping it will wear flats with it.


For a dance competition.  Fits perfect!


So cute!


Gorgeous dress!


Wonderful for the price. The fabric is a bit coarse, but it looks beautiful. I am a petite, slim framed woman and an x-small fit well. BUT the belt that comes with it is WAYY too long and doesn't have enough holes to cinch it in at my waist. No matter, I will replace it nonetheless.


Love it


Love this dress. Excellent quality. I paired it with a black petticoat and blue shoes for a pop of color and it worked perfectly. I got so many complements. I would absolutely order another dress for another occasion.


wore this to my bachelorette wine tasting day and it fit amazing. the quality was GREAT and it is super affordable! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!


If I wasn't so fat I never would have purchased such a dress.
