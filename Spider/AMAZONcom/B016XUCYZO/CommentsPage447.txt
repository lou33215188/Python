Super cute! Going one size up wouldn't have been a bad idea but it fits OK, just a wee bit snug. Other than that (which isn't a very big deal at all) It's prefect!


Quality material  the price!


BEAUTIFUL dress!!! I will be ordering more from this seller.


It looks good but I got it as a gift for someone.


Bright colors! Well made! Very full skirt with lots of fabric; thick fabric - good quality.


Beautiful and great quality!  My teenager ended up keeping it because she likes it so much!


Adorable!! Fit just right, will def buy from them again! Got a large, and it's comparable to most larges in Dep stores. Great buy and a lot of compliments!


Not the dress that's in the picture. Lighter in color, not as shiny, no belt. Definitely need crendeline.


LOVE IT!!! Addicted to 50' styal dressed this is my third one. It is long enough past my knees, (5ft 3in) can't wait to wear it. The belt is HUGE I had to make a whole in order for the belt to work.


Comfortable and cute. Got a lot of compliments wearing this dress.
