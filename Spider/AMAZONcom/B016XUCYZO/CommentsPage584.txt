I liked it fits perfect and the color and material match to picture which made me happy!


I love it so much


This dress is made of exceedingly cheap, thin and sheer material. It would require a slip underneath to be wearable, which kind of defeats the purpose of a summer dress. In addition, it was far too large, even in the smallest size. Don't be fooled by the picture or be sucked in by the low price. It's not worth it.


Very nice


Perfect !! Thanks
