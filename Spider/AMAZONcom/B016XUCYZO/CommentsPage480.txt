Absolutely love this dress!! Will definitely order in other colors, it looked good without the petticoat, but even better with it!!


Love


Classy and beautiful!


Its a very cute dress, not sure its will work for what I initially bought it for but for the price its a great dress and material is pretty nice.


Beautiful dress!  Pairing it with a crinoline for a fuller skirt.


Belt was very large, dress was a bit big on top, other than that the dress looked beautiful after it was taken in on top.


Very cute for the price.  Needed to cut many loose threads before wearing as they caused the zipper to not function properly.


In love with this dress ... thank you so very much


Beautiful dress, looks amazing, highly recommend


It was perfect for a summer wedding.
