Bought it as a xmas gift for teenage niece, She loves it. It looks great on, is a good length and washes well.


very pretty


Good


This is a beautiful dress, the material is good quality. It is made more for petite to slightly average! I hate I had to send it back!


Fit fine but was to long for me and I am only 5'2" I had it hemmed but other than that I love this dress


This dress style, with a petticoat, is wonderful. I went up one size, primarily to ensure the length. That is a XXL. I've bought from this vendor before and will do so again; definitely worth the price. Didn't get a fee for this review, either.


akward fitting. Extra fabric in bust, and skirt was waaaaaayyy to large. tight in stomach area


This dress was amazing, wore it for my ten year anniversary. Simply BEAUTIFUL... looking for it in other colors it really made me feel sexy.


I love this dress would buy it in every colour


I purchased this for my 14 year old as well as a petite coat! She loves the fit and the fun colors, she twirls and dances it was money well spent!
