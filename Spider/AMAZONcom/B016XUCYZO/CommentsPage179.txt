I had to return this dress because I am too long-waisted for it, but it was very well-made and I really wished it had fit!


Fits perfectly! Such vivid colors and great material!


I absolutely LOVED this dress!!


It fit so well and the material is not thin or flimsy. Would definitely buy more!


I listened to reviews and bought my 13yr old the small. She looked lovely. Very well made and fits just right.


Had to return, received a refund promptly. Thanks!


Fit great and worked wonderfully for our 50's day at work.


I love this dress...Number 4 I purchased from this Company..


This is a really cute dress. I didn't bother with the belt, but the dress itself was really nice quality.


I am 5'2" and 98lbs and I got an x-small which ended up being just a little too tight. I had trouble getting it over my hips and busted the seam by the zipper (oops!). Once it was on it was comfortable though so it was just the teeniest bit too small. I'd recommend people around my size get a small instead.


The dress is very nice. Bought it for my daughter, I would've have wanted it for myself but Im 6'0 tall, it fit my daughter perfectly.  The color is very vibrant


A really classy dress. Perfect for any occasion you might wish to dress up for.
