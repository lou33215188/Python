Super cute party dress! I wore it to a wedding and it was perfect!


Great quality fabric and stitching. Measurement chart was accurate. Would definetly order another one!


Beautiful and great quality! You will get complements galore in this dress!


It was a very cute dress but it fit too snug around the breast area so I sent it back but ordered another in a larger size


Bought this for my sistee for her birthday and she loved it and it fit well to its size! Might get one of these for myself because they are too cute!


My daughter loves it.


I am extremely happy with this dress. It fits according to the size chart provided.


Very well made, not cheap at all, fits even better than I had expected it to fit.


Wonderful Dress.  Slightly longer then I like but still great to wear. Zipper is hard to maneuver.


Perfect fit very impressed.
