Size is off, not what the chart says


Loved it...


Love the dress!!!!! Fits perfect.


Nice


perfect fit! love this dress.


The material is nice and it is comfortable to wear but it does come extremely wrinkled and the belt must be one size fits all because even on the smallest hole it's still 2x the size of my waist. The stomach of the dress is too big and the shoulders are tight. Kind of disappointed at the money I spent on this dress considering I got a nicer one for less money. The fabric isn't as high quality as shown in the pictures and I would not purchase from this seller again but now I'm stuck with the dress because it's expensive to ship it back.


It's a little tight under the arms. I have not worn it as of yet.


Fits perfect! Love it!


Looks like picture and fits great


The dress exceeds my expectaion! It's fit to size and perfect!
