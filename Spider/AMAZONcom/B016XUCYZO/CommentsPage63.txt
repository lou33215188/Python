I bought this on Primeday because it was cheap, and I figured it might be meh, but I was wrong! I expected an inexpensive dress on Amazon to suck, but it was amazing! I got it today and tried it on, and it fits perfectly! The waist is a teeny bit loose but the belt makes it unnoticeable! The fabric is nice and the seams are well sewn! Overall, I am incredibly surprised that this dress is absolutely great, and I'm absolutely going to buy another!


This dress is so beautiful and I received so many compliments from men and women both. Wore it to a wedding reception and I was the best dressed woman in the place (well with the exception of the bride), don't under estimate the feeling of wearing something that makes you feel beautiful. Definitely going to get it in other colors/prints.


Had to return it. The dress is beautiful and looks like great quality. However, the sizing chart said the 2XL was a size 18-20. The XXL that arrived isn't even close to that. I wold put it around a 14. Wish it was right size because I love it!!!


I am 5' 4" 130 pounds and a b cup. The medium dress fits very well. I got the white and black one. The material is nice, not see through at all. I may even buy another is a different color. My only complaint is that it rubs on my arms a little and the belt was a joke, but I had another one.


Waistline is too high and dimensions are off.  Im 5â€™8â€� with a long torso, however this would never have fit even if I ordered a larger size. Armholes are tight. Im usually a size 10 and I could barely take a breath. Go buy a vintage pattern and make it yourself- thats my advice and what I plan to do.


It fit as expected, but the quality was off considerably.  Of course, we get what we pay for and I was worried that given the price it would be a cheap material and it was.  FYI, the white is "very sheer" and the dress is not lined so you'd have to make sure you wore something under it (or be prepared for everyone to see everything).


I absolutely adore this dress! I'm between sizes, and was iffy on what size to buy. Do make sure to look at their size chart in the image description, and not the amazon standard size chart. It's totally different. I bought both 2x and 3x, not sure which would really fit me right. I'm a short gal at 5'1" and 245lbs, very busty with big hips, an hourglass shape. The 2x was plenty roomy, and extremely comfortable to wear, yet very flattering and beautiful, and the length together with the petticoat hit me about 3-4 inches below the knee. I'm in love, I finally feel pretty in something again. I want more colors!! Thank you, GK.


I super love this dress!!! My size is 36DDD, 150lbs and 5'1".. I ordered XL and it fits perfect!! I got sooo much complement!! Thank you Grace Karin!!! This dress made me look so Fabulous!! ğŸ˜ŠğŸ’ƒğŸ‘Œ I highly recommend it!!


Really pleased with this dress!  I looked at the reviews prior to ordering and am glad I did because the dress does run small!  I generally wear a large but ordered a 2xl considering the reviews.  It fits like a glove.  The fabric is a little stretchy which I like.  I'm no too pleased about the stain on the dress - it's a grey mark right on the bust but it's small and I'm hoping the Tide pen can get it out.  If it came without the stain it would have gotten 5 stars.


Beautiful dress and excellent quality. I got so many compliments! (Nevermind my crooked belt in the pic. Itâ€™s actually straight, but my hand was pushing it up.)
