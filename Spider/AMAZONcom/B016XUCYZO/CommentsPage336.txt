I absolutely love the dress! It looks great on me and I have received several compliments during the few times that I have worn it. The only issue that I had is that it is a little large in the shoulders but it's not very noticeable.


Beautiful. Got a lot of compliments!!


Great looking product how however the fit is smaller in the bust.


Very happy with the dress, purchased to wear at Dapper day.  Seems to be well made.  I sized up based on the size chart but it's a little big. I'll be wearing a crinoline under it and a wider belt so it should be fine.


Amazingly lovely dress, great fabric with body, well constructed, and fits well.  According to the chart, I am between a "M" and "L".  My measurements are 38-29-38, and the "L" dress fits very comfortably.  I added a wider belt with elastic which cinches at the waist.  I will order in other colors.


Very Cute!


Definitely like how the ACEVOG dresses drape much better than this brand. This one kinda poofs out in the front. A petticoat resolves that issue but I don't always want that look. The deep red and black polka-dot pattern is exactly what I expected. It is awesome.


I'm a 10/12 and the large fit me really well. A bit tight in the chest but I'm pretty busty (36DDD) Otherwise I love the dress, and if fits as expected! Lots of looks when you wear it!


I ordered 2xl according to reviews read. It fits good. I plan to order more colors.


It fits perfectly except for the belt which could be an inch longer.  Really like the look
