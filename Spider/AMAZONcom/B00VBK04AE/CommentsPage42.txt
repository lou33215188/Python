i got this dress very wrinkles so I couldn't wear it for my celebration ☹️.


But the dress is beautiful if without the wrinkle.


really liked this only wished it had pockets


my daughter and her friends love this dress. If my daughter is not wearing it, one of her friends is.


Gorgeous dress but I'm having to exchange for a larger size because it s way too small. I went by the measurements when ordering but couldn't zip it up when I got it home.


Mido 5 pies. Así que me quedo largo


If you are not an expert in ironing (like me) prepare yourself to spend some money in the Dry cleaner.. Beside had some white dust all over.. Like it has been throw on the floor before arrived in and all  wrinkled inside that envelope.. You can tell that was never ironed before!


Adorable dress but size up if your busty. I was able to get it zipped but the cut of the dress was too high and tight in the chest. I returned it and bought a different dress in the same fabric.


love it


True to size, nicer fabric and construction than I was expecting for the price. Very happy!!


Have not worn it but I have tried it on and it fits great. I did have to buy a size larger since it seems to run small.
