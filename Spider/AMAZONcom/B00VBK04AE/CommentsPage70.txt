Great fit, great material. Isn't see-through, and very flattering. The cotton does wrinkle very easily, though, so be warned that it will get mussed a bit every time you sit.


When I took the dress out of the package a button fell off and after the first washing the black faded to grey. Not happy.


This is a great dress for the price. I got it on a lightning deal for about 11 bucks and you can't go wrong with that price.


My daughter is 5ft tall and 100lbs and the small was too small. So dissapointed,  they don't have this print in a medium.


Not western sized


Too small - Gave to daughter


I ordered an XL in this dress that is supposed to fit women size 16-18. I decided to go with the XL in case the dress ran small. Well it ran very small...the size XL fit my size 8-10 sister, perfect. Not at all true to size. Beautiful dress but too small.


The belt didn't even come close to fitting...the dress itself fit great!!! The dress looks plain without the belt!!


Love this dress.  I'm a size 15/16 and the large fits just right.  Comfortably snug on top, and an open bottom.  Highly recommend!


Beautifully made with good quality cotton fabric. Fit perfectly with no alterations required (I am 5'2", 119 lbs, ordered a medium). Thank you for such a beautiful dress at a great price.
