This dress is made of extremely cheap material, it feels like an old tablecloth. its not nice and shiny like the picture shows, its dull & rough. I'm returning the one I bought, I'm very disappointed.


Beautiful dress


I absolutely loved this dress.  I wore it on New Year's and got many compliments.  The material is perfect... I've already washed it and hung it to dry.  It kept it's shape and size. I ordered a petticoat to wear with it and at first was too puffy so I cut out one of the layers of the petticoat.  That fit perfectly.  My husband loved it.  You won't go wrong buying this dress.  Make sure to order a size higher.


Ordered for my wife and she loved them. Make sure you pay attention to the chart to figure out what you will wear in comparison to waist and bust.


Update- one of the ones we purchased the zipper seems to stick.


This dress does not disappoint!  While it was a tad longer than I had expected, adding a petticoat underneath would make it beyond perfect.  The material and craftsmanship of this dress is gorgeous. It fits as sized in the pictures by the seller.  Perfect for any occasion as it can easily be dressed up with a great pair of shoes and jewelry.

This dress was far better than I expected for its price point. Used the belt as a headband, and it made a great Dapper Days dress ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»


This is a hit, very gorgeous. . ordered a large, I'm 170, 5'11', 31 inches around the waist and small chested.. a little big on the chest area. other than that, it fits beautifully. . Looks so great with the petticoat  on.. can't wait to wear it to my sister's wedding..  Got it on a deal, only paid $11.99 for it and it also came with a thank you card in it. I'm soon ordering more in different  colors.  100% recommend


I LOVE this dress!. I bought the red stripes in a M. I usually wear a S but reviews said the dress ran small. I'm 5' 5" and weigh 112, I'm pretty sure the S would've fit since I have extra room all around. Thinking about it... The fabric is great, a substantial weight without being too heavy. The red is a vibrant true red. A great dress.


Too small around the bust/waist area. I normally buy a large because I'm a 36 B and wear a 12 size pans (USA measurements). The left side of the skirt is wrinkled and odd because the pleats do not extend very far. Make sure you know your measurements before buying.


LOVED this dress but it was swimming on me, unfortunately. For reference, I am 5' 3" and 112 pounds. I bought the small. But the dress itself looked well made and was so cute.
