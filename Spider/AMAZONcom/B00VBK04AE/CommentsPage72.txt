I followed the size chart, and ordered based on my measurements, It fit perfectly. I'm 5'1", so it hits me right below the knees. You don't really need the petticoat, but it hangs sort of sad if you don't wear one. I put a red ribbon belt on it instead of the black one that came with it. I thought it was cuter.


The fabric was nice and the print was wonderful but the sizing is waaaaaay off!


arm holes do not fit size of dress.


ABSOLUTELY loved! I have a handful of dresses from Lindy Bop and feel that this dress is a better fit, nice material, and great price! Will definitely buy a few more in different patterns. LOVED.


it runs very small. I normally wear Large and I had gotten this dress XL and was extremely too small.Overall the dress is very pretty and nice fabric. Only downside is the sizing.


I love this dress! Lots of compliments! I ordered a small and I'm 5ft 107 pounds. Wore it for Valentine's Day. It also came with a belt.


Love it... Almost have every color


Delivered quickly and correctly.


I ordered based on the size chart not my normal dress size.
