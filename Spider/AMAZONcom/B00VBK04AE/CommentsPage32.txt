Very cute-sits at natural waist and looks as cute on as it does in the picture! Love the fabric weight and composition. Very comfortable to wear and cute, all the way around! Would recommend this company.


Perfect and dressy. Great vintage styling piece and can be worn in office, I'm tall so this dress being long was so beneficial. As with any online shop, KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS.


I ordered the black and red flowered dress. I wear between a 12-14 depending on the cut and I am a 38DDD so I ordered a XL. I honestly could have done the Large. The material is stretchy so there is room to work with. I am 5'3"and it reaches just above my ankle. Hope this helps you ladies out.


Beautiful dress. Nice material with a bit of stretch to it but doesn't distort the print. Be sure to view sizing chart as dress runs smaller than normal sizing.


You can wear this alone but underskirt is highly recommended. Just need to be patient and spend some time to iron it before wearing it. The fabric wrinkles easily. A very cute dress.


Good quality fabric, well constructed. The color was well represented in the photo. I am very satisfied with my dress. I would only add that I wish it had side seam pockets. There is ample skirt to hide them and it would be nice to tuck away lipstick or keys.


I love the style of this dress.  It runs a little small, but I can work with it.


The dress is beautiful and the quality is top notch.  My only issue is the fit in the top is a little snug.  I got a 3x and I'm a 22 on top.


I knew it would be a little tight through the chest area but the length is perfect. Super comfy dress and very cute.


Amazing  dress!!!  Bought a size 6; perfect  fit!


Going back to buy the blue.
