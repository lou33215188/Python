Love the length very elegant good quality cotton bought it for my daughter who is very tall at age nine and mature fit her very well


The size chart is very helpful. Although my daughter's measurements were a bit between sizes, I focused most on her waist measurement and the dress fit perfectly!


Pretty dress for lots of occasions. I like that the belt/sash can be adjusted or taken off. I am 5' 8", 140 pounds, C cup size and the small size fits but is tight around the top.


Buying another one in another color lol I'll probably but one in every color, this dress is so perfect in every way.


Runs small. Also, the lining on the bust of the dress is CLEARLY visible through the front of the dress. I returned mine.


Ordered off the size chart included in the description.  Although it's not the size I would usually order, it fit well.  Nice material, all around lovely dress. Looks even better with a crinoline slip underneath to promote the fullness.


Beautiful and great quality!


Fit perfectly and well made


Too small for this style and color. It was a gamble that I am going to need to return.


size chart is pretty accurate. I'm 5.5 and 161lbs. the XL was a perfect fit. looks exactly as shown. I ordered the black stripe.
