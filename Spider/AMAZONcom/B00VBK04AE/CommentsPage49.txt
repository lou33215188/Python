Love it.  I bought these for my bridesmaids.  They are beautiful.


This is such an adorable dress, perfect for our upcoming retro cowgirl party! Thanks for having such fun outfit options at an affordable price. The dress is well made and has a ton of detail.


Wonderful craftsmanship And dresses run small so order bigger size


It's great! The zipper isn't super high quality but what did I expect- the dress is super cheap and is surprisingly good for only $30!


Love my dress! Great quality and price!


Still fit just a bit tight. However the button loops were not large enough to put the buttons trough.


I love it. It makes me look more cute


Thank you


Way too small.  Returned it.


Love the dress fits great
