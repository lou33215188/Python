The sizing on this was all over the place. Ended up giving it away, as it was too large for me.


This dress makes me happy! I feel great in it and I love the pattern. It fits great and makes me feel amazing.


The sleeves are a little tight. The dress is adorable and fits beautifully everywhere else. I might take the sleeve holds out a bit to be more comfortable.


I just received my dress in Red Wind true to it's color, the price, style and fit was just right.  I also bought a petticoat which made it look even more so wonderful. Just one thing pockets, I love pockets so I'm going to have someone put them in for me, no big problem.  Thank you this dress is going to look good at my friends 60th birthday party.

The quality of the fabric and construction was excellent. The blue was really more dark purple, but absolutely beautiful. The fit was surprisingly perfect on my 5'8" frame. I did end up returning the dress, because the style was not becoming on me. I would definitely order other clothes from this company.


I love this dress. It is perfect for my informal nonbeachy beach wedding. I am 160 lbs and 5'9" with biger thighs and a soft tummy the XL fits just right. It also fit at 165 lbs. It gives me a lovely silhouette. When it arrived it was very wrinkled but a trip to the dry cleaners and problem solved (I don't have an iron). The seller was also very helpful and prompt in responding to some questions I had.


Dress is beautiful, absolutely love it!


Beautifully made and a perfect fit. Use the size chart! It will ensure you dont need to make returns. Fantastic lines. Very happy


My wife like the dress. It looks great on her
