It's super cute!


I wore it as a costume and it was perfect


Adorable! This cute dress hasn't gotten me a date but I feel my confidence soring as I twirl gracefully through the yard!


I ordered a medium.I am 5'6, 145lbs and 38B bra size.It fit perfectly.True to its size.


I received so many compliments on this dress!  Plus its really comfortable and fun to wear!!


Very pretty, but did not fit as expected.


This dress is very beautiful and fits well, i would recommend it to anyone who wants to look gorgeous!


Nice dress, but the zipper is terrible. Rather than return the whole thing, I’ll just get the zipper replaced.


5’7 164lbs and M fit perfectly


beautiful dress for the right occasion.  the belt was a bit snug though.


I adore this dress.  It's easy to iron and fitted me as expected.
