Good thing I followed the measure board, I ordered one size over, my daughter usually wears medium I got her the large and is just great!!


I had to do an alteration on it because she is short, so I cut the dress a bit to get it at her knees, other then that, It's a perfect Dress!!


Five stars well deserved!


I am a bust size 36" and waist 28". I ordered a size medium and it fits perfectly.


I deducted a star though because the bottom hem curls up. I have iron it down before I can wear it.


This dress fits perfectly!! The length is just at my knee. 5'5" 34-26-39, small is just right!!


Omg I cannot say enough good things about this dress. The quality of the fabric was impressive right out of the box. When you pick up the dress it feels heavy like it's not flimsy at all. Lined in the bust. Stitching is solid. I have already found reasons to wear it twice in 2 weeks.


Bought for daughter as an orchestra concert dress. She wore it with black tights and black flats. Very pretty with hints of Audrey Hepburnesque style without being a total vintage throwback.


My daughter is 5'5", 110 lbs. I believe we ordered a small.


THIS DRESS IS AMAZING!!! It has the tiniest bit of give, which makes it look like it was MADE for my body. I have an hourglass figure so, pin up dresses are my go-to and this dress is amazing. The only downside...no pockets!!! I also don't care for the belt that comes with it cause it's the exact same stripe pattern, but it does have cute buttons. I will probably use the belt for other outfits.


I would have given it 5 stars, but the belt didn't fit. It was extremely too small.  The dress itself fit well.  It is beautiful and I love the bird pattern.  It's perfect now that I bought a belt.


This dress was delivered today and I had to get on here and do a product review I absolutely love, love this dress! So glad it's offered in plus sizes and the fit was perfect I am so happy thank you.ğŸ˜� #LUOUSE


I was so skeptical ordering this dress.  I LOVE this dress, the fit is very nice and although packed in a small bag, the dress has nice weight to it.  I will follow-up later with a photo.  I fit a size 4-6 but bought in an x-large.  There is a little room but not too much.  I will continue to purchase in the future.


Adorable! It fits perfectly. I am usually an extra small in dresses but the small fit perfectly!. The print is fabulous and it washed beautifully too!
