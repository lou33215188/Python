I love it! It's beautiful!


fits great. looks exactly as photo. elastic on waist band at back to receive buttons is also a neat idea.


I'm 5' 1, so the dress was a little long on me. It's a little tight on top too but a very cute dress.


Love it! Fit was perfect. Loved the color too.


Too small up top


Longer than expected, but beautiful


this dress will fit fine, but the zipper was not working too good.


ordered for my granddaughter it did fit her nicely


Fast shipping, love my super cute dress


I looooove this dress!!! It was perfect for the wedding I wore it to!
