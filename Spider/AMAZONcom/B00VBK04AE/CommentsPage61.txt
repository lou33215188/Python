Got lots of compliments!


Loved the dress, fits perfectly.  Looks best with a petticoat.  Belt is definitely a bit on the small side but fits as well.  Could be fixed with new elastic fasteners for the buttons.  Ordered the XXL.  I'm 5' 10", 42" bust, 34" waist, 42" hips.


Love this dress so much


I'm happy with it


I loved it !!! It came in sooner then expected and fit as ordered! Everyone gave me great compliments!


Nice dress just does not fit me the bodice is a few inches too big all around:)


A classic beauty with superb old-fashioned craftsmanship and quality fabric to match!


Everything is perfect about the dress


I love the material, and the flare. It's what I expected.


Looks great on!
