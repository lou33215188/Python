Gorgeous, but too small in the chest. :(


I love this dress. It was a little tight around the arms, but it was beautiful on.


I love the style of the dress, but it was too tight in the bodice, especially the bust. Normally an 8 or 10 fits my bust line just fine.


OMG!!! Love this dress fits perfect


Bad quality. It was wet when I received the package.


Uber cute!!


It was perfect! Very cute!


I love this dress, the material exceeds my expectations... My only complain is that it's a little too tight in the bust area but other wise beautiful dress!


I was very disappointed! The dress did not look like picture.


I really loved this dress.  I am hoping to get the female choir members to order one in black.  The fabric is excellent.  I had to order a size triple X.
