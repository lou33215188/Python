awesome dress but not true to size. Not even close. The dress is well made and very nice looking but the sizing chart provided by the merchant is seriously off. Consider ordering one size down. I'll be returning this for a smaller size as I do really like the dress.


Perfect fit! It’s a tad long but I’m just short. It’s my first dress like this and I’m so happy with it. The bust & waist fit perfectly.


This dress is adorable!  It fits true to size and looks so cute on-I received quite a few compliments on it!  I'm a bigger girl, and quite busty and this dress zipped up perfectly-no issues!


Ok


Love this dress! BUY


This is really a beatiful dress all around, the cut, fit and material are all amazing. I really wish they would have used a better zipper on this beauty, mine broke before I got to wear it out, I had to get it replaced immediately after I got my dress, if you don't mind replacing the zipper, this is a great dress otherwise!


I love this dress! Awesome fit, awesome color! And I get compliments every time I wear it!


The most certain way to a put smile on your daughter face. Super nicely done, good quality for unbeatable price. Love it


I'm 5'4" and 130 pounds. I ordered a medium black dress and I like it. It's up to my knees and fits like a glove. The only downfall about it is that it gets wrinkly fast. But totally worth the price!


This dress fit great and looks great too! I'm 5'5 and about 120 lbs and ordered a small. It has just a small stretch to it and the material was nice!
