Love, love love. Fits better than I expected. The belt was weird though.


I really like the dress but it was to small.


It's really flattering and fits well. I only wish it had pockets :)


My daughter loved this dress.  She is between a small and a medium US size. I ordered a medium for her and it fit her perfectly.  She LOVED it! Very elegant.  You can definitely see Audrey Hepburn in this dress.  Taki


Very nice I wore it for a wedding as a bridesmaid. It  runs a tad small. I ordered a large and normally wear a medium top.


Very pretty but sizing is way off.


This dress is absolutely gorgeous. It can be dressed up or down. This dress looks great on and fits just right. I'm very pleased. I would love to have it in red.


Would be super cute if I could get it on. Will be returning as these dresses run close to 3 sizes too small


SO many compliments on this dress! Fits great and washes well!  I would love on in every pattern!


Dont know how to say how satisfied i was. The dress is amazing. I wear it for my birthday and everybody told me i look like a little girl. It fits me as i expected. I'm 5.38" and 140 pounds, the medium fit me well. The material is good. And don't need to wer a petticoat. Its amazing!
