Fits real good


Great dress fits well


Love the dress


It is so pretty!


I ordered a 3X based on the size chart but it proved to be WAY too big. I sent it back, ordered the next size down, and it fit just right this time. Love the print and can't wait for warmer weather so I can wear it!


I wore this to a company semiformal event. I feel a little selfconscious about weight these days, but because I'm busty with a small waist, this dress was extremely flattering as it hid my hips and thighs. It got multiple compliments the entire evening and was told by a friend who didn't attend that she heard I was the classiest looking one at the event. How nice!


this material is great. stretchy but not thin. i have since looked up and bought dressed from this brand several times!!!!! love them all.


Wrinkled.


The dress is wonderful. I wore it to a wedding and got many compliments. I love the fabric but wish it were woven not stamped. I fear the color will fade.


Loved the design however, the size indicated was tooooo small! The sizing chart is wrong,  wrong, JUST WRONG!  The size I chose was my typical size! Very disappointed hence this is the second time ai ordered from this company!! NEVER AGAIN!!! ğŸ˜¡
