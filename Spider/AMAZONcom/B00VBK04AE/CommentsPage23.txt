This can be casual or formal - you can dress it up with a poofy petticoat for a beautiful silhouette, or without and it's still gorgeous.  The bodice is lined, it's machine washable and irons easily, the skirt has great movement when you walk and it's very very comfortable.


I couldn’t love this dress more than I do—it’s a great fit, I’m 5’7 and the medium fit perfect.


Love this dress however it is a bit tight across the chest hence the 4 starts.


Fabric is ok. Casual dress. Comfortable fit.


The dress looked and felt ok but the sizing was not correct.

So cute on.  Fits great.  Love this dress.


Ordered this dress twice. First in a Xlarge.  The fit was a little tight in the bust and waist.  Ordered the same dress a second time , but in a XXLarge.  It fits the same as the first,  absolutely no difference.  This makes me wonder.


beatiful dresss my wife loves it thank you


This dress fits very well. It is cute! I am 5ft 5 " and weigh 150 lbs. I bought a medium and it was perfect. One issue is that there were some bleeding of the fabric after washing hence 3 stars. I am not overly peculiar so I can still wear the dress again.
