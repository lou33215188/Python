Bought this for a funeral but with a little tweak, wear it to parties as well! The belt in the center completely detaches so you can mix this dress up easily. Definitely buying it again in additional colors.


Love


This is a gorgeous dress and the quality is beyond my expectation.


I should have order an 1x .. The extra large was tight around waist and upper chest area... But it is still a pretty dress..


Beautiful dress


I can't  say enough. I LOVE IT and it fits perfect. Perfect!!


I was nervous about buying a dress online that I couldn't try on, but it was great! It fit perfectly and was so flattering. The material is much stronger than I expected as well. I would definitely recommend!


Thank you so much ! The product is awesome , very high quality ! I'm so happy


I ordered the largest size that was offered but it still feels a bit tight. Wish it wasn't so wrinkled in the package.
