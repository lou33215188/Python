Fit was adequate but the neckline was WAY too high- very uncomfortable!


Surprisingly wonderful in every way. (got the one with blue and white vertical stripes) It's well made and fits great. With that in mind, the value is above and beyond.


When an item is so reasonably priced and it's made in China you cross your fingers and hold your breath...and then you tell yourself that you get what you pay for. This dress is better made than some dresses that cost 5X as much. The fabric has a nice weight too it with a bit of stretch, the seams are solid, the removable sash fits well AND has covered buttons.


One thing to note when it comes to fit: I ordinarily wear an S in US sizes (34/27/35--107lbs) but got a M in this dress and it fits like a dream (I don't like a sausage casing fit)  with a tiny room to spare esp. in the bust area. (Fixed with a different type of bra.) At 5'2" the length hits me about an inch below the knee and that's exactly how I like it. Generally, I am never hesitant to have a dress altered if the fit is too big, but in this case it doesn't need it.


I love this dress SO much, I'll get another one in a different color.


UPDATE: Got another dress, this one, in red, cowgirl/rodeo print. Beautiful, fits just like the previous one (white and blue stripes) â€“the color is vibrant red and the print crisp. Looks just like the photo. (no bait and switch here)


Washed it in the washing machine on warm and hanger dried it. Came out great, didn't shrink nor wrinkle too much. I'll iron it but could get away without doing it. Such a great buy, can't get over it. Now I want the bird print...


Initially I had an issue when I ordered this dress. I received a men's shirt. Dissapointed, I contacted the seller explaining my dissatisfaction and disappointment. Today, I received the dress and its a wonderful and perfect fit. It's such a pretty dress. No regrets on this purchase at all. I greatly recommend this dress. So many compliments already ğŸ˜Š


Absolutely perfect! Great length (I'm 5'6) good for twirling and surprising quality. Definitely buying more colors.


I got a 3x and it fits like an XL. Beautiful fabric though


I really love this dress! I got the striped blue & white dress & itâ€™s so cute! I was kind of scared because I went a size bigger & I do not regret it! It fit me great! I also got a size bigger because I wanted it to go below the knees, & it did! I am 5â€™0 and weight 115lbs as a reference.


I just love cotton clothing and even more old fashioned dresses.  Though, this dress was advertised as being 97% cotton and the actual tag on the dress says that it is only 75% cotton.  That is the one thing I didn't like, but I still do love the dress.  The tag also says to not iron, which worries me when it comes to the pleats.  It is a pleated dress after all and not being able to iron it will make it difficult to make the pleats after washing.


fits well, the neck line is a little big though. looks cute on.  I matched with a cropped yellow sweater and multi color heals


I bought this dress as an option for attending a wedding and when I opened the box I was afraid it seemed small but the material has some stretch to it, not much though, and it fit perfectly and looked amazing! Since I also love wearing dresses for work I believe this will also be a perfect number for that. The material is quick to wrinkle but it seems sturdy!


This dress is classy and perfect! Don't think about it buy it!
