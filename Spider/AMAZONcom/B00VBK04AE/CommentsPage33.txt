Very comfortable and pretty. I wore it to see the nutcracker. Added a small black jacket and a petti coat.


This dress is so flattering and fit very well! I’m 5’8” and it hits my knee so the perfect length. I have a hard time finding properly fitting clothes being tall and very “hippy” but I’m in love with this dress!


just beautiful beautiful  fit well wear it over and over I love it my remember to get one size bigger


My only complaint is the zipper is a bit hard to unzip, but otherwise this dress is amazing! So cute!


I love my dress, it’s the first one I’ve ordered from Amazon that actually fit perfectly!


This dress was made so cheap! No lining or anything. I returned it!!!!


Very pretty, fits well, and a great value.  The material is nice but it was a little short for me so I did not keep it.  I would be curious what others have said about how well the color holds up after washing.


I double checked the size chart to make sure that it would fit me before I ordered.  The dress is really really cute in person, but when I went to put it on, it was 3 sizes too small.  The 3x was more like a size lg.


Great quality, I bought this for my sister for a WwII reenactment and she got a ton of compliments. It fit her perfectly


I love this dress, fits very well. I got lots of compliment.I am a size 14, I followed the reviews and got a XXL which was perfect. One thing about this dress is that you have to be prepared to iron, but i did not mind the ironing, it look great on me.
