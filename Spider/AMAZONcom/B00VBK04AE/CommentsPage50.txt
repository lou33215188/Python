Love the dress. I'm a size 12-14 and had to get a 3X size but it's very comfortable and quality is good. Would but more.


Awsome and stylish

Love love love!!!


It is perfect like it Was mas Ã© Just for her


Although the picture appears to have a satin look, it is very dull. Overall, it is a pretty dress and fit well.


love this dress!!!


Very flattering but I'm a 40D and it was a bit tight in the bust area. Overall, great dress


Too short and does not look like the pic


Bought a large.  It fits perfectly.  It was an extra dress that I thought I would return if the other dress I bought worked out better but I'm going to keep this one.
