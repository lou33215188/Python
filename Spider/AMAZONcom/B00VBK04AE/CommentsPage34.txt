LOVE this dress, very flattering and fit according to measurements; received many compliments! Thanks so much for making online dress shopping easy!


Love it!  Very cute.  Only gave it 4 stars as material wrinkles very fast. I usually wear a size 10 or medium, runs small, glad I ordered the large.


Great quality fabric. It was super cute and I was so excited, but the sizing is off and I had to return.


in love with this dress so mo that I had to post it on Facebook right away. It  a great design and make me look much better that I could imagine. The dress maybe vintage but looks modern and in style too. No regrets and may even be best item bought in last few years.


Really cute dress-I have a petticoat that I wear under it that helps to give it some needed volume. Very happy with the fit and the quality of this product.


This dress is a great buy. Every time I wear it, someone asks where I found it. The fabric weight is cool enough for summer and be paired with a sweater for cooler weather. Very comfortable.


It's a beautiful dress. I ordered a size 16. It ran too small, however my daughter loved it. Therefore, I gave it to her. She wears a size 8. It fit her perfect!


Beautiful dress, originally I ordered a medium size which according to the sizing chart should've fit but it was too big especially in the shoulder and chest area so I returned it for a small and now it fits perfectly! Love it so much!!!


I usually buy dresses in XL size (to fit my bust) and take the waist in several inches after purchase. That was my plan with this dress, because the sizing chart said that XL can fit up to a 43 inch bust, however, I can barely fit my 40 inch bust into the dress and zip it up properly.  I can hardly breath or move my arms while wearing it. It's pretty though.


Looks nice but runs small on me. Fabric is also on the thic side. Returned it.
