I love birds, but it is difficult to find dresses with bird prints. I love the length and chest coverage. The only downside was the size. I usually wear a small and ordered a medium, yet the medium fit more tightly than expected.


Amazing !!!  Every time I wear this dress, I get a compliment from every single woman who passes me!  I wear a black tulle petticoat underneath it and a black shrug if it is chilly.  I'm bringing back to the 50's look !


This dress is not only lovely but, it’s really well made for the price - I’ve purchased others on amazon from different sellers that had no lining and the zipper was awful - this is much higher quality! Super happy with the dress :)


Loved the dress.  Sizing if way off.  My medium size dress felt like an x-small.  I’m going to order the dress again in an XL and see if that fits.


This dress fit exactly as expected, unfortunately the belt that came with it was two sizes too small. Luckily the dress looked cute without it. Material is sturdy, handled my hemming it without issues.


This dress is a pleasant surprise for the price. Great durable fabric, however it could use a good iron. I liked that the waist band with the buttons is a separate piece, almost like a belt, and you can adjust the height of your waistline that way. Fits well in all the right places.


I've only worn this dress once so far but I got so many compliments on it! I ordered it big, expecting it to be a smaller fit but I think it's actually true to size because I've definitely got some wiggle room.


Many compliments whenever I wear this dress , I’m a size 10 and a medium 5’5” 165 lbs , had to order a large


42 D/ 36in waist / 5'5/ ordered size 3x and it fits beautifully. I did not want it mashing my chest in so I sized up from my normal 2x when ordering this style dress. True to color.


Very nice dress. Had to return because it runs very small. Its cute though and well made
