Beautiful dress, but a Medium fits more like a petite small and so I ended up giving to someone else about 5'2 and 100 lbs that it fit perfectly.


Halloween costume but could possibly wear again


I absolutely love this dress!!!!!!  Fit so nice!  I think I will order another color. Ladies you won't regret it!!!!!


I am 5' 1'' so the dress is too long for me.  I will have to get it altered.  The dress fit nicely. Looks really cute on me.


The button loops are too tight and do not go around the buttons. It is a good thing that I sew some myself so I can extend the loops to make it work.


Bought size medium. Im about 5 feet 3 inches weighing 140lbs...I purchased a dress of Luouse prior and everyone loved it so I purchased another one...I can't tell you how beautiful the dress is and its thick material so don't have to worry about stitching. Absolutely amazing!


I am enjoying this dress. It fits just right


This dress is one of the cutest I have ever bought! It fits perfectly and though I was worried about the quality, due to the reasonable price, it is stitched and made beautifully. I absolutely recommend buying one... if you are on the fence... take the leap you will not be disappointed.


Fits like a dream and the pattern is adorable!


Cute but too small in the arms. Waist was cut too high for a women's fit a-line.
