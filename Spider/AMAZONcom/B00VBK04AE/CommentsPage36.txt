Perfect! Looks great! I will order another pattern as well. I love it!


Loved the color (wine). Loved the length. Zipper gets caught every time though and the belt was too small to actually wear. Didn't return because it was otherwise perfect. Wore to two weddings so far.


Omg...if I could marry a dress, I would! Fits like a glove. Made really well and the fabric is perfect! I was nervous to order without trying it one, but I am thrilled! I'm gonna buy more!!


The material is a bit thin, other than that looks just like the picture. I'm 5 foot 2 and 100 lbs, I ordered the x-small, fits me well below the knees and a tiny bit loose.


i love the dress. very pretty blue. very modest and simple.


I loveddd this dress! Its true to size and put together pretty well. Only thing is, it comes folded in the package so there was many wrinkles and had to get dry cleaned/pressed. But it came out beautifully!


This dress was small in the breast i had to purchase a similar material and add it under the arm . This dress was well made and it look well but  my daughter is a bit busty. Remember it is best to go up a size and get it take in to your fit . Beautiful dress


Currently my favorite swing dress!


Great dress and the size was as expected. The fit was great and I love the colors of the dress.  I got a lot of compliments.


Super cute pattern and silhouette! Ran slightly big but I think the next size down would be too small. Would buy it again in another color!
