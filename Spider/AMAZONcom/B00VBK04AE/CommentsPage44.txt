I was a bit nervous about the dress fitting but I just tried it on and it fits perfect. Usually I wear a size 14/16 I bought a xxl and it fits just right. Looking forward to wearing it for my cousin wedding.


This dress is exactly what I was looking for! fabric feels comfortable, perfect shape and length (I'm only 5'2"). Fit is just right. I want it in all the colors!


Beautiful...perfect fit...with petticoat I felt like a princess


Very nice fit and navy blue color with a gorgeous neckline. Purchased with a navy tutu underskirt to fill out the bottom even more as I'll be wearing to a wedding.


This dress was exactly what I was looking for ,I was going for a vintage dress for a black tie that I am going to. The fit is as they say , The quality is good..Happy customer ..


Absolutely amazing for the price. Fit perfectly!


Great fabric and fit. Zipper is a little stiff but will probably get better after a few more wears.


Love the dress but size is about 2 sizes smaller than it is labeled.


Cute dress. Fits snug but seems like nice quality. Plan to retune though. Not crazy about the pattern


I ordered this on a Friday morning and received it the next morning. I wear a size 14 and ordered a XXL and fit as expected. I felt very comfortable wearing it.
