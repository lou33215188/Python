A huge pain to iron, but it's an adorable dress.


I love this dress! I bought it for my office Christmas party last year and received so many compliments. The top is fitted (without being too snug) and the skirt is the perfect length. I was able to dress it up with a sparkly belt and a statement necklace.


This dress is SO cute! It fit great! It could have been a little tighter, but it was still very flattering. I am 5’10 and usually wear a 10 in dresses. I got a Large, and it was a nice fit. I wore to a sorority tea and got many compliments!


Bust line hits too high and makes you look fatter than u are...but really cute fabric


The fit was great, but the print wasn't as cute in person.


This dress is so perfect for the shower I'm hostessing! I'm a size 8 and the Large fits perfectly,  falls at the knee. The material is surprisingly stretchy. The belt with two buttons is a separate piece and is adorable!  Such a good buy!


It’s such an adorable dress. The price is fantastic for the quality of it. The fit is pretty spot on. I’m a large normally but ordered an extra large because I’m a 40E and things normally get too tight around the chest. I might’ve been able to get away with a large though. I love this dress!


I love the fitted lines of this dress! It was a bit longer than I expected it to be but I'll be able to hem it easily to be more proportional to my frame. I'll definitely order from this company again


A tad on the short side for a 50's dress, but a great fit and price!


This is a very beautiful and comfortable dress.
