This is the first dress I've bought that fits perfectly! The belt is a little big but I can take it in. The dress is not too tight in the shoulders and its a little stretchy so it's perfect for dancing in. The color is more blue than periwinkle but I'm okay with that. I don't normally like dresses but this one is beautiful! :)


Somewhat small in the waist


The dress fit perfectly, but the belt was wayyyyyy to small. But whatever, I still love the dress.


Cute dress. Fits well. Buttons need some reinforcement.


Absolutely great!!!! Fits perfectly!
