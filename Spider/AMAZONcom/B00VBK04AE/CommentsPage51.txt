good one


This dress is wonderful and can be styled so many different ways.  Love the matching belt.  Only minor complaint is that it fits a little tight under the arms.


Too small.


Really nice dress.


I had to have this dressed hemmed quite a bit, as I am only 5'. The color was beautiful, the fit around the waist was great. Some of the stitching was a little snaggy, but overall, I am very pleased.


I love the dress  it fit as  expected


this dress was made from good material, great structure, but it was too small.  was going to return the dress but my daughter liked it so much and it fit her perfectly. She wore it to church.


Love it


Dress looks nice but it ran small so I didn't have the time to exchange it before an event so I had to wear something else.


Ordered a small and a medium because it was a bit unsure, the small fit great!  Very true to size.
