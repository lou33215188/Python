I love, love, love this dress. I loved it so much I purchased it in two other colors. Great fit. Perfect length. If you love the 50's look you can't go wrong with this dress.


I loved the fit of this dress and it was priced very affordably. I wore this to my husband's company Christmas party and received so many compliments.


Dress fits great, ordered a size up as recommended. Fabric is a little thin but absolutely wearable with a slip underneath.


Beautiful dress with vintage flair! I bought this to wear as a costume in a play. Hoping it holds up well.


really cute but just didn't look right on me. lovely though on the right person. fabric is nice


It looks like the picture. Love that it is cotton, just wish it was not packed in a tinny box. The pleats are wrinkled and a bit of a mess, but I still like the dress.


I absolutely love this dress !!! It’s amazingly beautiful! I am 5’2 and 135 and a medium fit fine ! Great quality and beautiful detail to the dress !


This dress was really cute on and fits as described. I will definitely buy more.


really love this


Nice dress but too small
