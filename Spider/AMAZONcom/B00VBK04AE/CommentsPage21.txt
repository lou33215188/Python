I was a little worried when the package arrives because it was feather-light, but once I opened it this beautiful dress unfolded! I order a size larger as their sizing chart indicated I should. It fit perfectly and I received at least a dozen compliments at the bridal shower I wore it to! Absolutely love it and probably will buy it again in another print!!!


There was something wrong with the zipper unfortunately.  It came right on time for the occasion but I had to return it.


Totally cute dress, but it definitely wasn't designed for women with big breasts.  I wasn't able to zip it up in the back, and I'm really sad because I loved this dress!


Beautiful dress, well made and nice fabric. Canâ€™t beat it for the price.  Medium was a little snug so I exchanged for the large.


This is adorable, I love it, no defects, fits great, fabric is good quality and beautiful. Would order again in about 3 other colors with birds.


I received my dress today and tried it on. It looks great!  I can't wait to wear it. It's lightweight but has very nice material. I would definitely recommend this dress. Feeling like Audrey Hepburn in my classic vintage dress.


this is the only dress I've purchased so far  that fits well, not too large or too small. The quality of the fabric is very good and the color is great. The only complaint I have is that the hem is uneven, enough so I notice it, I'm picky about my clothes. I'll have to take it to a seamstress and have the hem redone. Over all I really like the dress. The sizing chart is accurate.


Absolutely gorgeous.  I weigh approximately 180 lbs and it fits perfectly.


Love this, very comfy and I got a ton of compliments, would 100% recommend!


Dress is beautiful but came in navy, I thought it was electric blue.


Also came with no waist belt.


Other wise, it's beautiful.
