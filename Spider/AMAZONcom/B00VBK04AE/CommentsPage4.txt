I can't tell you how much I love this dress. I bought the navy bird dress, and it's the cutest darned thing I've ever worn! I can't wait to show it off, especially at work. It comes with a white belt, but the dress looks good without it. I think I'll use the belt for some other dresses I have. The material feels like pretty good quality and is a little stretchy, so it fits me well. I love how it accents the best in a lady's figure. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get some others designs from LUOUSE in the coming months. Vintage-style clothing has become a weakness of mine lately, one that I'm happy to indulge.


Took a little time to get it but was a manufacturing problem not the sellers fault. They kept me up to date on the shipment. The dress is lovely. Very flattering fit with just enough stretch so you can breath in comfort. Love the full skirt with a petticoat I purchased separately. Can't wait to get my others. If you use their size chart it fits just fine. Definitely would order again. Thumbs up from me.


I followed the recommend size chart and ordered an XL when I usually wear a medium.  Fit perfect!  Great dress for $20.00. Very comfortable. I ironed out wrinkles from shipping and it looked great all night. I did get a petticoat to wear underneath for fullness!


I love this dress!! I am 5'1 115 pounds I ordered the small and it fit great!! Falls just below the knee. When the dress came in it was well packaged but the bottom of the dress was very wrinkled just tossed it in the dryer on wrinkle release setting and fixed that. Only one problem. The zipper malfunctioned on the first time wearing it ğŸ˜� I was so disappointed as I loved the dress but the teeth on the zipper was messed up in one area causing the zipper to split after it was zipped up. I am gonna have it fixed because I love the dress!!! The material feels great thick and stitching is perfect very well made!! The little belt wrap in the middle is optional it can be removed.


very pretty and nice material. I purchased this dress thinking it was prime as I had ordered two from the same link but in different prints. The other dress ( blue stripe was too big and I returned it. This one was shipped from China, did not arrive in the two days and I have to pay for the shipping to return it. Which I think is wrong. ) It arrived in about 10 days but when I tried it on it was too small in the chest. Which is the complete opposite of the same dress in a different color that was too big in the chest. Both were ordered as mediums. I was tempted to try and let out seams but decided against that and will pay for it to be shipped back. (What a scam)


Although I returned these (I ordered the navy with the birds and the blue and white stripe) because I found other dresses that better fit the occasion I bought them for, I thought that these were very cute and flattering. The fabric is a little thin and wrinkle prone but not bad for the price. Next time I'm in the market for new dresses, I might repurchase.


Measure yourself and use their size chart when ordering! It might not feel nice to have to order a much "larger" size than you're used to but it'll ensure you get a dress that fits. (For ex: I'm used to XL but had to get a 3X!)


Finally,  for clarification, if the color you're looking at has a belt in the image, you'll get a skinny pleather belt. If it doesn't, it'll come with a belt/sash made out of the same fabric that the dress is made out of that comes together with two buttons.


I bought this same dress in two patterns--this lemon one, and the turquoise birds one. I'm 5'7", ~150lbs, and a 34D-36C. I usually wear a 6 in dresses.I ordered both the medium and large in both styles because reviews of sizes varied. I'm glad I did! The medium of the turquoise birds fit great--in fact I had a bit of extra room. The medium of the lemon I couldn't even zip up, and the fabric belt that came with it was probably 4 inches short of even touching. The large in the lemon fit great--maybe even a little snugger than the medium turquoise birds. The large turquoise birds was huge on me, so at the very least the sizing discrepancy was consistent between the two styles.


But overall, I'm very excited about these! I wouldn't say they're HIGH quality--unlined, pretty thin, and not soft. The white lemons is a little bit see through, but not terrible. But they're perfectly adequate. For <$20 I'm really not complaining. They're cute, flattering, unique, fun dresses. You do definitely need an iron or steamer, they came in very wrinkly.


Hard to get the wrinkles out, but otherwise I really like it.  I am a misses 8 and ordered the XL.  If you are near a 36" waist and bust 38C or larger, definitely an XL.  I might have been able to squeeze by with a L, but the fit is ok without being too tight.  I have been eyeing this dress on websites the likes of rosewholesale etc, and didn't want to take a chance on waiting six weeks for my order, or I didn't want to pay exuberant shipping rates for a low price.  This was a good find on Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.  I did try this dress as recommended with a petticoat, and it was too fluffy for my taste and age, but I think it looks great without it.


I bought this for my daughter to use as a bridesmaid dress. I absolutely love it. We had the sleeves altered a bit due to her not filling up the bust area. It is slightly smaller than expected but still fit her perfectly! Will probably add a petticoat to fluff the skirt a bit. Great material and very well made. Pics without belt and after alteration
