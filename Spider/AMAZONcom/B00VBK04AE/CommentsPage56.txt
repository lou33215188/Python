a little more spandex than expected- but it is very fitted and flattering


Wonderful quality and a beautiful dress. So glad I ordered it.


It's a beautiful dress. Was just a liitle tight under the arms. Reordered a bigger size.


Fits perfectly. Wrinkled but that was to be expected. I'm 5'3 a little over 120lbs. Ordered a size small.


Button loop on belt immediately came undone, but it was still a cute dress and can be worn without the belt


beautiful dress, just cut to small. Great fabric and color.


This dress is even better than expected. The quality is great, especially considering the low price, and it fit perfectly! I expected to need to wear a petticoat, but I don't think it's needed.


I love the fit of the dress. However, the dress is more kelly green in person. On my computer, it looks more teal.


I love this dress!  Colors are bright.


It does fit snug, but for me, true to size.  If you are big busted, may not work.


Beautiful dress!
