Very pretty but makes my behind look somewhat big.


i get numerous compliments everytime i wear this dress.  i bought it for a 1950s party, but the style and print are very appropriate for an office environment as well.  the back dips a little low, so I just pair it with an orange cardi.


This dress was super cute. It was a little tight in the arms, but outside of that perfect!


Everyone  at  church  loves  this  dress


Super cute casual dress for a great price. I would purchase again.


This dress is so lovely, I'm 5,4" and it falls just to the middle of my calves. It's a super flattering shape. My only complaint is the belt that came with it was missing a button and the other one popped off when I tried to fasten it, but it's alright because it looks just fine without it.


Love this dress!! I am 5'5'', 125-130 pounds, have a size 34B chest and ordered small and it fits great. It's not too long and the skirt looks lovely even without a petticoat underneath. It's a nice thick material and the birds are vibrant against the dark background. I can't wait to wear this out somewhere!


I got the red dress with the white polka-dots and black belt, and I LOVE IT! I'm wearing it to work today for the first time and have already gotten 2 compliments within the first hour. I might get more in different colors, lol.


Would five five stars but the buttons fell off in the wash.


A little long, I'm 5'6, but otherwise fit perfect for an hour glass shape. Read the recommendations for a petticoat if you want that added flare. Without the petticoat, it will lay flatter.
