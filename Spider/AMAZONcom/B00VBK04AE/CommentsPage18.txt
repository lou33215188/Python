I paid attention to the size chart the seller provided and it fits. The Fabric is thin-ish but its not see through so we are good to go. Its very cute. I would buy more!


I was a little nervous to order a dress online, and from Amazon. I ordered per my size and the dress fits perfectly.


The material has a little give, is light weight and will make a fantastic summer dress. I am anxiously awaiting the petticoat, but the dress can be worn without one.


Love the dress. Fits great but belt is too small. I can hopefully press it and make it longer. The colors are bright and it laundered beautifully.


Love it


Will buy more


Great cut and fit! I love how this dress looks. The material is a strange blend though, which makes it iron a little strange. Not enought of a problem to rank below five stars though!


The fabric is so thin that it spilt in several places when I washed it for the first time. Sad. I liked it, but only got to wear it once.


Cut is not as impressive as picture.  Great price thou for a nice cheap dress.  doesn't flow as much as picture. shipped super fast, fit was perfect.  it was just a good dress for a good price.


Really great quality for the price! I couldn't be happier. Looks amazing with a petticoat underneath. The seams are even and well sewn. Fabric is of excellent quality. Much nicer dress than I had expected for only 30.00.


Very cute and nice for summer.  Easy to alter the waist to fit.  I'm 5'8" and it is slightly above my knees.


I love this dress! It is adorable and looks perfect with a crinoline underneath. It is very stretchy, so it runs a little big. I’m 5’2 and 120 lbs. and the small fit perfectly.
