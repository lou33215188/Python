The dress I got had a zipper sawn in badly that gets stuck every time you try to pull it past the waist seam. The belt that came with it was the wrong size (2 inches too short). Otherwise the fabric is sturdy and other seams look OK, so I don't know if I'm unlucky or the quality control s always poor, that's why 3 stars and not 1 star.


Not a true navy color as I'd hoped. Fit was a bit tight. Otherwise very pretty.


This dress is super cute with or without a petticoat. I wore it to Tokyo Disney and for Halloween as Minnie Mouse. However, after wearing it several times, I started having issues with the zipper. It still works but takes a little persuading.


Chest area is too small. Pretty dress otherwise.


This is an adorably made dress that doesn't make a thirty-something mom feel frumpy OR trashy.  The fabric is substantial and the skirt flares out properly; I can see it being worn with or without an underskirt.  I think the chest and armpits are cut ever so slightly small; I am 5'5" 120 lbs, and have a B cup -- anything larger in the chest, there would be no room.  As is, though, fits my body type perfectly.  FYI: I found the high waist to be just barely restrictive, but it does give and stretch a little.


I bought the navy blue with birds in a 3X. I normally wear a 14-16 and am large busted. The dress fit like it was made for me. Fitted, but without being too tight or uncomfortable, and extremely flattering. Armholes are nice and large also, so they don't cut up into the armpit. I am just over 5' and it hits me probably 1-2" below my knee. The print is very cute, and it has a nice retro fit & flare style. You could use a petticoat or crinoline if you want extra volume in the skirt, but I don't think it is necessary. Material is substantial, not sheer, and not too thin or cheap-feeling. I won't use the belt it came with (it instantly went into my Goodwill donation pile). I'm impressed with this dress for $20, and will definitely be ordering more for wear-to-work dresses during the summer months.


These are amazing great quality dresses for the price. The material is pretty thick and a tad stretchy. But it's very comfortable. Well stiched and looks good. I bought two dresses going by the reviews and I am glad I did! Just order two sizes larger than what you wear. I wear an L but ordered XXL, although XL may have fit me too. But since I like to wear looser outfits, this fit the bill for me. Would need steam ironing but I don't mind that. I am happy with my purchase ğŸ˜€


I was looking for an A-lined dress for a flattering look when coming across this one. Since I am considered "chesty", it is usually difficult to find one that doesn't stretch everywhere and/or fit over my chest and still give me a flattering look. This was a great combination of not only fitting over my chest but also giving me a flare and not feeling as though the dress is too short. This quality of the dress is amazing as well, especially for the price point! This dress is lined to make the dress feel like it's more than just a piece of fabric, but made for a nice social gathering.


This dress is everything!!!! I really like this dress; the fit is as expected and please know I added a crinoline petticoat of the same color. It is well made; the construction is very professionally done; the fabric has a nice sheen to it and looks expensive. I was so very hesitant to buy this dress but once received, know that I am well pleased with this purchase. This dress and very feminine and classy especially with a simple pearl set.


I'm so so so disappointed. I LOVED this dress so much that I bought it in 4 colors. They all fit perfectly. After washing in cold water and hanging them to dry they STILL shrunk! They are completely unwearable now as they barely pass halfway down my thigh. I'm so sad because I loved these.
