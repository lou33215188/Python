The neckline of the dressed ripped, when I was putting the dress on! The material looked nothing like the picture!


Great deal!!!


The dress is a beautiful blue.  It fit well and I didn't have any trouble with the zipper.  However, the belt was to small.  I think that belt was just put in the wrong bag.  Over all the dress seams great. I can't wait to wear it.


Love it!


Absolutely loving this dress!


Love this. It fits perfectly.


Got a lot of compliments, love how it fits. The only down side is that it comes really wrinkles.  But I know how to iron, so wasn't a big of a deal.


Love it


I simply love this dress
