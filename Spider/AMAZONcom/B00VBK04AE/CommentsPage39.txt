Great buy. Fit perfectly for the measurements given. My daughter LOVED IT with the petticoat!!!! Washed at home and had professionally pressed. Material was sturdy, although the belt was a little off in symmetry, you could not tell with it on. The belt loops were a little too snug, but we managed. Very satisfied.


Sent back, way too small


not true to size, it's too small and the fabric is cheap. I will be returning it ASAP!


Love it! Get compliments all the time.


Beautiful Dress, although the belt is way too small for this dress & the zipper sticks, I still am glad I bought this, it is gorgeous.


My daughter needed a dress for an event and this was PERFECT!! She was very happy and it fit her perfectly. Good fabric and length. She was very satisfied. Definitely would recommend


I ordered a 3X my dress size is normally a 16/18. It's still a bit tight around my back but looks super cute! Only thing is that the belt that it comes with the buttons are very flimsy and feel like they're about to fall off.


The dress is beautiful.  I think the quality of the material is great especially for the price.  I did as other sellers did and wore a petticoat with it.


If you have a small waist and larger bust, this dress is perfect.  It is very figure flattering.


Love it! Also love that the matching fabric belt/waistband had the buttons sewed on with matching elastic loops so that it fits perfectly.
