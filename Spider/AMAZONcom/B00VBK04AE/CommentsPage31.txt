It's a nice and simple dress. It doesn't have a lining but the fabric is not see-through. Ordered the equivalent to a size 12 (US) and it's a little big around the waist, but nothing terrible. I really like it and will buy again.


I love the style, but the fabric is a dust/lint/pet hair magnet. I could walk around lint-rolling myself in it all day and never catch up.


I love this dress. Its just a tad shorter than I like and a tad snug on the bust area. I wear a bolero with it and feel beautiful


The dress is beautiful love the material . I highly recommend.


Dress fits great but the belt seemed a little long for my waist. Easy fix though. Love it.


This dress is nice and fits great.the belt however did have some flaws and could have been a quarter inch longer.


Fits just right and I like the style but the faces of the cowgirls were all really disfigured..


Great fit. Love the dress


Cute design, fits my 15 years old niece nicely.  I highly recommend it.


I used this dress as my Disgust costume from Inside Out. I hand painted the pattern on. It was a little time consuming but turned out great!  I was even able to alter the belt.
