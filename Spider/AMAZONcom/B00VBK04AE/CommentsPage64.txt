This dress fit me exactly as I expected it to! Great purchase for your $$$$


Let me start by saying I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! I followed the size chart and the recommendations made the dress fit perfectly. It is a great weight of fabric and lays nicely. The only reason that I did not give this dress 5 solid stars is because the belt that comes with it is a size smaller than the dress. Maybe I got a bum belt, but it would be perfect it if fit as well as the dress. The neck rolled a little, but a few stitches will correct that problem. I love it so much that I ordered it in red too!! BUY IT!!! You will not be disappointed.
