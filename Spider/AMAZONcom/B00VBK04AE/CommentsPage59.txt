love the dress but to small. the cut was very nice.


It's stunning!!!


Fit like a glove....


Beautiful dress. I got exactly what I wanted. It even arrived sooner than expected. Very happy!


Ordered this dress in several sizes for my niece's wedding. Order one size larger and the fit should be good.  There was no medium available so we ordered 2 sizes up and had to alter but it was very easy to do.  Dress color is not as blue as in the picture but has a purple note in the ones we received.  I had to order another small to match the dye lot of the others that came.  The small was very blue.  When ordered it came with the more purple note.  They must be ordering from a different distributor for the material used in the dresses.  Niece was very happy - she had no clue I had to order these twice.


Fabric is cotton and gets very wrinkled. Fits perfect.


Very nice!


Very nice dress for the money.


Must have a smaller waist to fit properly.


Beautiful
