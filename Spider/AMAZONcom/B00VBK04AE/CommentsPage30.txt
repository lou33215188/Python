Excelente !!! Very Nice !!!!


LOVED this dress!!  Is does run small, in the bust area, but for me not an issue.  The seller was very accomidating, needed it by a certain day and it came before then.


Fit perfect very perfect. I ordered 2, they come together very fast after 2 days in the best conditions. I'm more than satisfied. I can't show picture right now but I'll post next week. I love my dresses


I really liked this dress and I received many compliments too. I didn't have any issues with quality at all. The color was pretty close to the picture as well. I plan to order at least 2 more in the other available colors. I did not wear a petticoat,  but i think I may try one in the future. I was very pleased.


It's a cute dress and the belt really makes it.  However it is much longer than I expected.  I know I'm short (5'), but it hits me about four inches past my knees.  I'll need to have it hemmed.


Very cute, but the zipper kept sticking. If it wasn't for the zipped, I would've kept it. Was returned.


I ordered the green bird print. Fabric wrinkles easily and is somewhat stiff. I am 5â€™5, size 20, and ordered a 3x. Fit as expected. I added a tulle skirt underneath for poofage.


Loved it. It fit a little snug for a small but not too much. It's only a little snug since I'll be wearing an undershirt with it. I do love it though. I ordered the lace to go under but I think I like it better without it. It's very flattering. I love the way it flows out. Material seems very good. I can't wait to wear it out! Will be ordering again soon.


Gorgeous red dress. I bought a medium and I am 5:4 140 lbs. It fit and feels great for the price. Awesome bargain and great seller. Absolutely no complaints.
