This dress is made out of a decent, fairly sturdy material. It has a slight stretch, which is nice. I had to order several sizes up from normal, and the buttons on the belt came off, but were easy to fix. Overall, I like this dress!


Usually wear 12/14 i ordered 3x and fits amazingly! I want to buy  each and every one of these  dresses. The price is amazing so is the quality of the dress for the price! Cant wait to wear it out...


nice dress runs small


This dress was a perfect fit. Sizing is true to measurement table. Fabric has a slight stretch so it fits like a glove. Very well made dress. Could not be happier with my purchase!


It is well made for the price. I bought it for my 10 year old daughter so it is a little big on her in the chest area but I expected that. Otherwise it fits her great!


Excellent quality! My little sister loves the dress for an event we have coming up this summer!


Exremely beautifuly dress! I absolutely love my dress because it is exactly like the picture, color and all. Great quality material and design. I will definately order this dress in two more colors. Very classy fit!


Bought for a company event and was very happy with the dress and how it fit. Not a fan of the belt but I wore it anyway because it came with the dress.


Somewhat small in the waste


Nice fabric, fits a little bit looser then I thought but not baggy still looks good on. Only complaint is it came so wrinkled. I had to take it to get steamed because you cannot iron it
