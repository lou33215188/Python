I was worried about the small being to large because I usually wear an xs but the dress fit just right. I'll have to raise the hem a bit for my height but it's a beautiful dress and great fit overall


Nice dress, decent quality, but much too small if you've got a large chest.  Unfortunately, have to send back.


Pretty dress. Liked the material.


A little long but I'm 5'3" otherwise I loved it


Great dress! Fits perfectly. And the material is beautiful! Not cheap! Would definitely purchase again from them!


Looks and fits like pictured it is a empire fit


Want to return this dress. Cost too much to have it altered.


My dress was horrible.  There is a huge water stain on the front of my maid of honor dress that has to be worn in 3 days. With no funds to replace this in time i do not know what to do.


Flattering dress


The material was extremely thin and the top half of the dress was see through. I was very unhappy with my product and didn't even try it on because it looked very large and horribly made.
