Great quality for a great price. Love how the material stretches. Used for modeling


Perfect! A little long but fit perfectly!


This dress is goregous I wore it for my husband's Christmas party.


Fit nice!


I seriously love this dress.Ive worn it to two military events in the last few months and have gotten sobl many compliments on it..it matches my husband a navy blues perfecty


Nice dress. I wore it to a military ball. It does run small, so I'd rec ordering up. The static cling problem is serious! Be sure to have some non-cling spray on hand or something! I ran it through a metal clothes hanger a few times and that helped somewhat, but only somewhat. Enjoy!


The picture shows that the top is tight fitted but this is not the case, the dress is very stretchy. If you are bigger busted you'll want to contact a seamstress to get cups added to it, as it is somewhat see through. Since the back of the dress is open backed with shear lace covering it makes it difficult to wear any type of bra.


The dress itself is soft and stretchy, and the lace trim is also soft - not itchy at all. The color is a little darker in person than online. Overall, very satisfied!


Graceful and feel beautiful-added bonus is can get into it without unzipping!!!! I might find a crinoline under it to raise it up a bit-am 5'5" and it's a little long and don't feel like hemming lol!!!!!


this dress was amazing!  The fit was perfect and even though it's all lace on top in the front and back, you cannot see through it!  It was perfect!
