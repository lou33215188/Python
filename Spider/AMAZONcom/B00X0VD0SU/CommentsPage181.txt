Size does not fit - buy larger by two sizes to get your size - very cheaply made.


Love it. Good quality for the price.


Wore this to my Christmas party for work and I got tons of compliments. It is  lightweight and I love the way the dress moves with you as you walk.


Beautiful and formal. A bit long.


Just love this dress and its material


Perfect, absolutely wonderful


very nice


Absolutely love this dress. fit as expected. The waist placement is a tad funny but not noticeable really.


So nice and soft. It fits correctly and my beloved like how it looks on me.


FITS ME RIGHT. SIZING CHART IS CORRECT.
