Lots of compliments on this simple, elegant dress.


Adore this dress. I purchased for a formal bday party I was attending. Very figure flattering and elegant. Even though I was not able to wear a bra with this it still fit perfect and I never felt uncomfortable wearing it. I danced A LOT and thankfully the dress was very forgiving of me sweating like a mad woman. Love the material of the dress and the lace was soft and not itchy.


Look very nice to my wife


the length is a bit long... I need to stitch it a bit shorten by myself.  Even I wear 3 inches heel, still the way too long like 1-2inches.  Quality is good in  this price.


Very comfortable and beautiful!! I am very busty and it's hard to find something that's comfortable and covers the ladies. Very classy.


Nice quality. A little worried about how to wash it, as handwashing is recommended and ain't nobody got time for that! But it fits very nicely, and it's very comfortable.


This dress is elegant looking and fits and flows so comfortably. It is very long on me (5'6") it definitely requires heels


OMG ... its beautiful. ..i love the fit, the feel and the compliments.  Had put on some weight after my baby but it concealed everything.


Great fit as in size but does not compliment body shape.


I love this dress so much!! Got lot’s of compliments from the ball. The green dress works perfectly with the gold belt. I am 5’4, 121 lb, and got a small.
