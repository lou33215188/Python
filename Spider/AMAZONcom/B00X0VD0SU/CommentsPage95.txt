ITs perfect, I love the fabric, it is soft and does not wrinkle, much more than I expected


Beautiful dress but for was too small so I returned. Nice quality dress though.


The lace in the photo is a bit hard to see but the entire top of the dress is see through lace material.


Love this dress! Fits Great! I'm 5'4 and 165 so for the Large. Love the Color and lots of compliments.


This was a very nice dress.  The fabric alone would cost more than the dress itself did.  Unfortunately,  the zipper was put in incorrectly and I had to return it.


This dress is really pretty. I got many compliments. I purchased a size up after reading all of the reviews and it fit great. However the length is very long and I had to pay to have it hemmed. I am a 16 and purchased an XXL.


I got this in the red and it is perfect! The lace part is very soft and the flowy chiffon part under the lace hides my tummy. I am ALWAYS an 18/20 in dresses (Macy's, Old Navy, Target etc.) and I got the 3X. It fit perfect. It definitely looks way more expensive than $40! I am very happy!


absolutely gorgeous. wore it to a holiday party and got complimented all night


This dress is beautiful and comfortable. The material is surprisingly soft. It's long enough to reach the floor. I'm very happy with this purchase.


Looks exactly like the picture and it fits great! I didn't give it a 5 because in the back the lining and the zipper was stitched roughly so it left a bump in the back. But, with quick alteration it was perfect.


This was a tenny bit snug but otherwise a perfect dress! Would purchase again.
