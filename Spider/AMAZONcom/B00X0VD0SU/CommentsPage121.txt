Beautiful dress


The dress I received is nothing like what I ordered. The fabric is different, the cut is different, even the back is different.  Very disappointed as this was for a Christmas party tomorrow and I now have nothing to wear.


love this!


a little bigger then expected. the top part is lacey and see through. i bought a lace bralette to wear under and you couldnt twlly


Very comfortable.  Elegant flow.  Machine washable.  Perfect.


I received so many compliments on this dress last night! Amazing quality for the price! I ordered a small and the length was perfect(I'm 5'5")


Beautiful dress.  I bought this dress in navy and it looked wonderful.  I purchased the small, I'm 5'8 165 pounds. I bought the medium at first,  but it was a little loose.


OMG this dress is amazing.  Fits perfectly and is so soft and wearable .  Very true to picture .  For the price it is amazing  It has the feel and look of an expensive dress but, affordable


Love this dress great quality perfect fit


I'm 5'6" and it is long - I'm hoping that heels will help keep it off the floor
