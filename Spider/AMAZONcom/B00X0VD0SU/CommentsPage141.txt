I ordered a size bigger than I would normally get just to be safe and it was perfect


This is a very pretty dress, although I do think it needs a belt.


Beautiful dress.


This will be the perfect dress for my upcoming performance with my Alma Mater at Carnegie Hall!!!


Love the dress, it's so gorgeous. Can't wait to wear it.


This dress is perfect for a bridesmaid on a budget!  Its very lovely on and is made very, very well.  Great quality and great price!


Gorgeous gown. Fits like a glove.  Very happy with this dress


Great dress, too short for one of my bridesmaids.


pretty dress. but runs very small. i would recommend ordering a size up if you are busty. i am a 42 DD and i can't zip the size 18/20 in the boob area.


Super comfortable and very elegant.
