I just got this dress at 35 weeks pregnant. I am 5'6" and weigh 220 most of which is baby it feels like, I ordered a XXL . Anyway, I was looking for a long, flowy dress for a maternity shoot and ordered this hoping it would work. It does! It covers the bump while still having length and it is gorgeous!


Dress came a day earlier and it was absolutely beautiful !


Loved it! It was long but I got it tailored. I am 5'1. Buy it yall! Very nice for any formal event!


Used these as my bridesmaid dresses and these were perfect!


I bought this for my daughter's winter dance; she looks absolutely amazing in it (and says she feels so happy wearing it). Thank you so much for offering this beautiful dress at  such a great price!


The material is very good. The fabric is stretchy and soft around the chest. It does run a little long. It's as beautiful in person as it is in the pictures. Highly recommend.


Loved it. It was like if I got it in a boutique. Got so many compliments and it was just so comfortable. Perfect dress for any occasion. I felt so good at my brotherâ€™s wedding


I simply love this dress. for the price it is outstanding. I was not able to wear a bra and still received lots of compliments. the dress did not need any alterations just a sexy person to put it on. any type of jewelry looks great with it.


Ordered a few sizes up as a maternity dress.  Fits perfectly.


I purchased this dress for my sisters wedding and I was pleasantly surprised. It for great and looked beautiful.
