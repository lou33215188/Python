We had difficult with the zipper to up


This dress is pretty and well made.  The fabric is nice and doesn't look cheapy.  I have 2 issues with it.  Number one is that it is a little too plain, so I would want to add a sparkly sash or something to it - that's  personal thing though, not a reflection on the quality of the dress.  Number 2 is that the back is so open that I am having trouble finding a supportive undergarment that won't show through the lace on the back.  I saw several reviews where the wearer just did not use a bra, but my bust wouldn't work for that.  At least for me, the fabric is too thin and the dress is not structured enough for that. It is a pretty dress though, with a nice overall shape and quality.


I love, love, love this dress but couldn't get it sipped up past my back bra strap even in an xl. I reordered immediately in the xxl and returned the first one. Praying the next one isn't too big. The first one ran small in the bodice.


Its gorgeous


Love this dress!!
