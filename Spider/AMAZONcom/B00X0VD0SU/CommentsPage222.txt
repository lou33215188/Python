This dress is beautiful, especially the back.  The top is tight enough that even with a larger top area you may still not need a bra or sticky cups.  Perfect for a wedding, or nicer event!


Beautiful dress but too large. I was hoping it would be more fitting.


This dress is beautiful, it fits perfect. Dress looks fancy and the delivery service was exceptional. I order the dress in green and it looks really pretty! I might order the redbor black one.


The dress is beautiful but it is to small it runs small.if you wear a size xlarge it would be perfect. I ordered it a size bigger hopeing i would not have that problem.


About two sizes too small.


Just a tad bit big but Im gonna make it work beautiful


Wore for a wedding and looked almost like a bridesmaids dress. For the price it's a great find!


Purchased for wedding great fit kinda long if you're short. Breathable and great material.


I ordered these dresses for my sisters for my wedding. After trying multiple designer dresses (Many of them $250 and up), I came across this dress which was the style I was looking for.  I was unsure of the sizes even after taking measurements but they fit exactly as I thought they would. Because of the price, I was skeptical about the material but overall they look great on the girls. A couple of loose threads needed trimming. Overall, these were a great find.


It was somewhat tight in the breasts so i sent it back ordered the next size up. Fit great, but and I had to shorten it 5 inches. Love it though.
