I purchased a 3X and the empire waist is a bit tight on me... there's no "give"... so I'm considering my options.  :-/  Very pretty and I love the feel of the dress, however...


Very nice. Looked great and got praises.


Fitted me just right.


Great quality sewing and fabric.  Fit is very flattering for a mommy tummy.


Gorgeous red color.  Comfortable.  Wear a beige bra.


Bought this for a school activity. Gorgeous dress. Quality of fabric and fit exceptional. Especially considering the price. Highly recommend it


This dress fits so well. I have a pudgy stomach, and the high waist helps to hide that. It's very flattering. I do recommend a backless bra as the lace in the back isn't lined.


I received a dress that is entirely different from what is pictured. The dress that came to me is full lace with a completely different back and bust design. It's also very form-fitted, which was not my goal when ordering what looked to be a gorgeous gown. The other reviewer's photos look great - I just wish I'd received what I ordered. Was hoping to wear the dress to a formal wedding this weekend but that won't be happening. I'm incredibly disappointed in this seller. Have already filed a refund/return.


It's pretty, has good stretch, decent fabrics, was but just too large. Needed something at the change in fabric, like a belt or ribbon. Ok for the price, but didn't want to pay as much as the dress for alterations...


Nice Dress,I just have to figure out the no bra situation I am heavy chested and cant go without a bra we shall see. I was worried because I am on the short side but with my heels is will work out fine.


Pretty long.
