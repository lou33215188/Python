This dress is great quality and is very beautiful. I purchased this dress and it ended up being too small. I did the return process and ordered the next size up the same night. The very next day my refund was in my account. Easy returns. Printed the label from home and dropped off at ups. Great experience.


Beautiful dress, just didn't show my figure very well. Made me look bigger than I am.


My wife is 135lbs and a 34C and says that this fits her loosely around the waist and in the bust. Still pretty in person and the deep green color is as expected.


It's cute but not nearly as pretty as the pictures ....looks kinda cheap but will be a nice little dress for a nice occasion.  Not for what I was planning to use it for tho!


This dress made me looks and feel beautiful. It was just a tiny bit too long, but probably would be fine if your wearing heels.


Beautiful long flowing gown with a lace back I am just wondering what to do with my breast


I wore this dress in a friends wedding


I adore this dress! My boobs look fantastic in it. :)


Beautiful comfortable dress! The back is see through so will need a backless, strapless bra but the dress is gorgeous. Hides belly as well which I like! I'm 5,6 140 pounds and a size medium fit perfect.


This dress is huge.
