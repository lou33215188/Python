This dress was beautiful.  I'm 5 3 and it was way long but with heels it was almost perfect.  Very impressed


Great fit very figure flattering.  I am a size 18 and 5'4 the 2XL was a perfect fit somewhat long but with heels it will be great.  I am buying a silver dress sash/belt to break up the blue a little.


The dress looks a bit different than the one in the picture, but it's still a beautiful dress.


I love this dress! But it's hard to zip up nd down and and scared to break it b4 my day! But


Its a beautiful dress!


It was absolutely perfect!  I love it and can't wait to wear it!


Beautiful dress but it was a gift for a friend and as soon as she put it on, the lace ripped.


Beautiful dress!  Wore as a bridesmaid dress and it was perfect!


I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this dress is! Stretchy material that is soft and fits in all the right places. Definitely my favorite bridesmaid dress I have!


I ordered this dress to wear as a bridesmaid dress. I love how it fit and felt. The top is stretchy, the lace on the back is see-thru, so a bra was challenging. Great dress for the price. The only issue was that shipping was delayed, but I still received it in time. I would definitely buy this again if I needed another formal dress.


I love this dress! I am 7 months pregnant and wore it to an evening wedding. It was very comfortable and I got a lot of compliments! The dress is long! I am 5â€™4 and had to get it hemmed
