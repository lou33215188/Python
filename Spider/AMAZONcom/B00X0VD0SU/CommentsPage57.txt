I loved the dress. It looks very pretty on. I'm overweight and it was flattering on me. I had to get it hemmed because I am short. So far I've worn it one evening and it held up well. I'm really happy with this purchase.


I ordered two gowns for a Christmas ball. Red and purple. Was very pleased with the quality of this dress. Bright red, simple but assesories would jazz it up. Only issue?  Came in a plastic bag and wrinkled like crazy!!  Not sure if I should try to iron or leave it in the bathroom during a shower and let the steam try to get rid of them!


This is the perfect dress! It looks amazing on every friend that has borrowed it. It's easy to dress up or dress down. I've worn it for summer weddings as well as a black tie gala. The material quality is nice.


This dress is beautiful and looks more expensive than the price. Definitely worth it!


The first one I purchased did have a flaw (seam coming apart in the back) so I ordered another and will be returning the flawed one.


Super nice dress, nice feeling fabric, looks good on, fit great everywhere but super long! not even the highest of heals fixed the length!


I Love This Dress!! It is beautiful and the quality is amazing, especially considering the price. I wear a 42dd and the top part fit perfectly and securely, I am even able to wear it without a bra. Although a little tight around the waist for the waist. The back lace part just gives the illusion of nothing underneath. The skirt part hangs beautifully without clinging at all.  I am buying this brand again!!


I bought this for the military ball. It is a little bit big but  nothing a couple of safety pins couldn't fix. It really is beautiful! Very simple but the neckline and backed just a touch of sexy.


I wear a size 30/31 pant, large top and 40DD bra. I ordered the XXL and it fit perfectly! The seam/band under the bra line just above the waist is a titch tight getting the dress on (over hips and bust) but it''s super comfy once on! I will probably steam it before my event to get a few wrinkles out, but that's to be expected from shipping. I'm super happy, especially for the price!


It will only fit a petite woman. I'm 5'10" and it looked like a nightgown on me.


this dress saved my baby shower... i had previously ordered 4 different dresses from different stores... spent wayyyyy more money and none fit as expected. this dress was my final hope. the top piece is high waisted and a little stretchy which was perfect for my 36DD/DDD pregnancy bust and my belly. i'm 33 weeks pregnant, 5'0 and 148 pounds. a medium fit a little long on me but heels will help with the extra length. i'm so thankful for this dress. i will be celebrating my baby shower with comfort & confidence. ğŸ™�
