The fit in this was fine.  Unfortunately, it was about 5 inches too short!  Do not get this if you are over 5'7 at most!


I bought the wrong size sadly, instead of a medium I got a large which fit fine but a little loose and a tad bit long. This dress was perfect quality wise for the price and felt nice to the touch but I would recommend measuring yourself instead of guessing what size you are!


I am 5ft 4in and weigh 150 and medium size fit perfectly. I love the dress and great quality for the price


Beautiful dress and fits well. But.. If you have a larger chest, you might want to reconsider. I am a 40 D and its snug. Great quality though.


I ordered the 3x (for part of my Halloween costume) and it fit wonderfully! Except the chest area was a little tight. But I loved the fabric (not itchy or uncomfortable) & I LOVED the way it flowed! And this is the kind of dress I can wear pretty much anywhere, which is amazing!


beautiful dress! per the size chart, im an extra large, it was huge! im 5' 3", 135 pounds, athletic-ish built, 36c. I returned it and ordered a smaller size...but the dress is beautiful!


I was really scared to buy a dress off Amazon, but with the reviews I figured okay why not.  Its great!!! IT fit as expected and Was a lot higher quality than I expected.  Really unexpected and I am really glad I purchased this dress.  Might get one in another color soon!


Beautiful dress!! I bought it for my sister who was a bridesmaid and it was a success! She got so many compliments. It is a very forgiving dress and flattering! If youâ€™re hesitating, get it!


never thought i would buy a dress online with out trying it on and love it this is for my bff wedding ( bridesmaid dress) i will post a pic in feb 2016 the day of the wedding


Awesome product and seller.
