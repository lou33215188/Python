I love this dress, I am not a small girl and was scared to buy it on line, however, it fit great! would but this dress again.


Good!


Very nice, good quality , for a great price


I received this dress and when I opened the bag it smelled terribly of body odor. Someone had  worn the dress before and returned it and then they sent it to me. It was disgusting and I was very dissatisfied. Needless to say, I didn't even try it on. Just put it right back into the bag and sent it back!


Love this dress so much


The dress was too long.


I loved the dress. Came on time and looks beautiful
