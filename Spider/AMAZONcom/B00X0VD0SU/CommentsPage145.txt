Exactly as pictures, very soft, easy to zip, flowy dress


Just as pictured. Well made, gorgeous, and affordable!


Great material! Perfect fit! And all for a low price! All the bridesmaids look wonderful and we all are different sizes so don't worry about not looking good cause the dress is very flattering and comfortable


The dress fits on the small side but I took this into consideration because of the other reviewers comments and bought a size larger than usual.


This product is nothing like pic they show , it made of cheap item.


I don't recommend any one to bye this item.


love how this dress flows and how comfortable it is!


Small on top, too long on the bottom....looks okay...but sent it back...falls right at my problem area...not empire like the picture.....but for the price a nice dress.


Love this dress!


awesome


Love these dresses I ordered them for my bridesmaids and they fit and look great on all body types.


They are a bit long but it's not a big deal because they were a great deal.
