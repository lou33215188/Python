I order this nice dress, and got a whole different one. Strapless with a weird flowerly thing on the side, if only it had been at least my size I could use it, but it came 2 sizes down. So no, don't order this dress.


I needed a dress for a formal Military dinner, and fast. I ordered a few dresses by this brand (all fit quite well), and decided to keep this one. I wanted it to be understated and elegant, and this was so perfect! The back is gorgeous. I wore it with stick on cups. It doesn't cut at all to low in the front. I am 5'4" and usually wear a size 8 dress. With most dresses I would wear a medium, but per the reviews I ordered a large and it fit like a glove. It was too long for me, even with 4" heels, so it needed to be hemmed. Aside from the sizing difference and the crazy long length for me, this was exactly what I needed, and I got many compliments from strangers! I would not hesitate to buy from this company again...formal dress for this price is hard to beat.


Love this dress!


Beautiful dress.
