great fitting and looked awesome


This is the same dress I previously ordered. It is way too long. Much longer than previous one. Dissatisfied because the previous dress in a different color was the perfect length.


Beautiful dress for the money paid.


Use the chest measurement to determine your size and it should fit great! Also the front of my dress was pretty sheer not as see through as the back? but you could still see my nude bra through it. I just purchased a navy Cami from target and wore it under and it was perfect!


I was very hesitant to order this dress, mostly because I am a strange fit because of my shape.


I am 5'6" and weigh 150 pounds. My biggest challenge with dresses is usually having them zip all the way and me not look like I am ready to bust out of it because of my large bust.


I ordered a size medium and the dress fit me perfectly. It is really quite simple but still very elegant. You will need to get a backless bra for this dress and those typically run around $25.


The quality of the material is very nice. It is sheer but has a liner underneath. The zipper functions well and glides with ease.


I am very glad I purchased this dress and will more than likely be purchasing the same brand again in the future.


Ordered regular size.  Dress is beautiful, lace at top is stretchy and comfortable!


This dress fit perfectly! I’m 135, 5’6 and the dress just glided on the floor. Nice material and form fitting


i bought a black one just like this a few years ago for a wedding. and i like it so much i got the same dress but in green. i love this!


The dress was very classy and fit perfectly.


Wow!! 1st time I bought a dress online and to my surprise it fit perfectly. I'm 5'4" and 195lbs bout the XL and it fit like a glove.
