I love this dress so much & can not wait to wear it! Would be cute maternity dress too!


Good dress . perfect fitting but not made for a party.


Beautiful dress at an awesome price! Ordered it big, and still had to lose 10 pounds to get it zipped. I'm 5'9" and the length is perfect with my flat shoes.


Love it! Def good for any figure


Perfect fit I'm 5'8 150 lbs medium worked well slightly long but perfect with heels....


Very pretty dress. Very good quality and price is very less. Perfect fit.


I love love love this dress! It is totally flattering.  I ordered a size smaller than normal in order to make the dress fit tight around my chest since the back is see through lace.  Absolutely would recommend this.  Was complimented on it all night!


Got this in a large, I'm 150 and 5'9 size 8 or 10. Fits me perfect. The dress is so long it drags the floor I haven't put it on with my heels yet but I suspect it may still at least touch the ground a bit when I do. Very pleased with it and just may be wearing it to an event this weekend! So glad I made this purchase!


I buy it for my daughter but fit some kind tide on her but well she love it and she wants to keep it lol


Love it! I thought it won't fit me but actually was better than I expected :)
