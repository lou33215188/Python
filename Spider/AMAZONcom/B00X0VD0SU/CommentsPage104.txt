Pretty , but didn't wear it to my party, the zipper was messed up in back sewed in wrong ,stuck with it


The dress is very pretty, fits well and is very affordable.


I am in love with this dress!!! It is so beautiful and fits perfectly on me.


This dress is worth double the price I paid. An amazing green color and solid quality. I'm so excited to wear this to a wedding next week. I'm 5'3 so the length will be a struggle for me even with heels (but that was expected).


I am 20 wks pregnant and I wore it for New Year Eve. Got so many complements.(Bought size Small, Red)


Beautiful dress. Great quality. I'd get your exact size or smaller than your size. Fits a little large. Very long dress. Ordered five of them in different sizes for my bridesmaids and having them all hemmed a little. Arrived in two days! Happy with the seller and dress!


This dress flows nicely and is a very pretty emerald green color. Unfortunately, the material on the bottom layer is VERY thin. It is so thin you can pretty much see through it. Considering the all lace back and how few bra options there are,  I was not comfortable wearing the dress with the thin material.


How is this dress $30?!  Feels and fits so beautifully--it could easily be a $100 dress!!  I am 5'9" and 140 lbs, and a medium fit perfectly. Wow!!


This dress fit well and looked much nicer than you would expect a $30 dress to cost. I thought it's high waist made me look pregnant though. 5 stars for a pregnant person, less for other attributes.


bought it for a wedding, such a great hit. loved it
