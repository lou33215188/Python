Dress is very good quality and looks like it should cost way more. I would suggest going a size down though!


This dress is beautiful and fit perfectly! For this price this dress is a steal. Simple and perfect for any nice occasion!


I love it, is more than perfect


I really like the dress.  Good quality.  It will be perfect for walking my daughter down the aisle at her wedding.  Thanks.


Great fit. Runs a bit big but not bad at all


Ordered this for my mom to wear to my brothers wedding. She looked great in it! Great dress for the price!!


The dress was true to size...other than the length being very long. Easily fixable if you have time to get it hemmed.


I love it!  I would highly recommend it!  Its beautiful and comfortable!  Fits as expected also!


Very sexy for Christmas party this year!!!! My husband loves it!!


Love it!  nothing but compliments.
