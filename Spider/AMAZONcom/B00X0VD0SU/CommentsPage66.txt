I HAVE THE WORST LUCK WITH DRESSES. But this dress makes me so happy. Its comfortable and the perfect length. I am 5'3" and weigh 180lbs. I got a LARGE. I wear a 34C/D cup and it was perfect with and without a bra. I wore 4inch heels and the dress placed perfectly to the floor and i could still walk. I got the black dress. THIS DRESS IS AMAZING I RECOMMEND.


I love this dress! i got a lot of compliments. Got it last min literally. I ordered a night before the party. I took my chances and I was very pleased!! I got the red one. Which was beautiful. I weight 168lbs with a flat chest B cup and got a size medium and it fit so yay.


I didn't like the top area it was to short and the skirt portion sat too high up on the chest area. Had to return it.


This dress was advertisedan as an evening g gown, but it looks like any plain maxi dress. I will be returning mine, as it is not formal enough for the event.


I ordered ans extra large, and followed the size chart for the bust measurements because I am blessed in my bust to waist ratio, I have to order larger, 38 DD bust and 24 waist so the XL was good around my bust but to big for my waist, which I expected, very pretty on, elegant even.


Super comfy!


I usually wear a medium/large and the large fit nice, I could’ve gone with a medium for length and it’s so stretchy. I’m 5’7 and 180lbs still recovering from having a baby and this dress made me feel so confident and it fits like a glove in all the right spots. I’d order again in a heartbeat!!


got tons of compliments for this dress! decent quality and the color is great as well.


Looks good but the zipper broke within minutes of putting it on. Was not overly tight so I was not "squeezing in". Poorly made.


Nice but not as it looked in the picture.
