Loved the fit!!


I ordered a medium navy blue dress. It was a tad big on me waist and length wise. However it was beautiful, definitely not just a casual dress. It is worth more than the price listed. I am really looking forward to wearing it next month!


Too long and too small I chose a side between my size according too the chart. I don't like the material being used.


I love this dress.I did get a large . Did have it hem .Excellent in every way .I highly recommended this dress. Just beautiful .


Not as high of quality as it looks in the picture, but still beautiful and worth the price.


Percect dress perfect fit! Thick enough to not wear a bra.


This dress fits wonderfully. Stretchy and comfortable.  Uts a bit long but thats also partially because  i am only 5'2" but needed an extra large because of my bust size.


Perfect !! Absolutely loved the dress, color, material.. evth !! Great buy at a great cost !! :)


Bought as a bridesmaid dress! Very impressed by fit, comfort, and price!


Could not get close to zipping!
