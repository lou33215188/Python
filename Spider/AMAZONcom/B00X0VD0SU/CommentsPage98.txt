The color and size were a perfect fit! I am 5'8 / 175 lb. and the XL is just right. I have a larger bust, so might need to find a way to support the girls with the open back. Without shoes the bottom pooled on the floor a few inches allowing me to wear heels. The material is soft and of great quality for the price. Beautiful!


I wore it for a wedding everyone liked it.☺️


The lace looked really cheap. I felt it looked more like a nightgown than an evening dress.


Great for the price!


This is the dress I chose to wear as the Maid of Honor at my sisters wedding and I absolutely loved it. The fit was great and the dress was comfortable. I'll be keeping this in my closet for special occasions for sure.


The quality and the material of the dress was great! It fit as expected with enough room to breathe. It is very elegant. The only thing that if you are short, it is a bit long. Totally worth the purchase!


More like a nightgown than a dress the top is totally see through lace not what expected or the picture


The dress is beautiful. I was guided by the Size Chart and it was too big. Good quality fabric and it's very comfortable.


Super cute and comfortable. The neckline is not as low as it shows on the model. Love the green color! Can’t wait to wear it again.


Really like this dress for the price. My only complaint is how high the waist is. I recommend ordering a size up just for comfort. Otherwise, very pretty!
