Beautiful dress that looks formal and is very comfortable!!


so far so good love the material very beautiful dress i am 5"8 and it's the perfect length for me


Totally cute dress, great for a semi-formal evening or wherever you'd like. I'm 5'9" without heels and it's floor length. Fits as expected, no worries and pairs great with a trendy belt. Love the open-back concept too. Thanks!


Nice length


Awesome dress!  Wore it to a military ball, and it was perfect.  Very flattering.


It's great quality. Totally worth the price. I loved it for my engagement photos. But it does run a little big. It's very long also. I'm 5'7" and 140lbs. The medium was a little big and definitely long enough. I wore it with heels.


Beautiful dress. A bit long but I am short so expected. Gorgeous green
