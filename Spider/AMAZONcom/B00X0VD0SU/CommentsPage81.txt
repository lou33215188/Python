The most comfortable dress I've ever owned.. it's glamorous, elegant and and flows nice. Definitely had a hard time getting the wrinkles out from shipping.


I buyed this dress for my bridesmaids and l'm in love. The lace is so soft and well done, the skirt is long enough for tall girls. It's a little small. So if you going to buy, take a look to your measurements.


Bought 2x way to small had 2 different people try it on and it runs very small more like a 12 maybe 14 depending on bust size. Overall thought the dress was beautiful and made well. I was sad fit was off.


Its a pretty dress, however its too small in the bust and the top part is so sheer I'll need a chemise to wear underneath.


I purchased 5 or 6 different dresses on amazon to try for a bridesmaid dress, and this was the clear winner. It fits great and is very flattering.


Beautiful dress!!! I love it. The color is same as the picture, a little long but beautiful!


I was happy that the neck was not too deep for me.  I should have gotten one size larger and it was too long for me at 5'5 as I can't wear high heals. Nice dress!


I love this dress. It is pretty long, even when I wear heels, so beware of that. It does crinkle easily, but other than that I really liked it.


Fit perfect and looked amazing my daughter used it for a prom dress


Very pretty dress. I'm 5ft 4 and it drags just slightly on the ground, just enough to be a trip hazard so will take to tailor and I wear only flat shoes, no heels. Great dress for price and color is true to what is shown.
