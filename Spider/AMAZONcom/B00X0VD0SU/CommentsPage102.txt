I loved the dress, but I am giving 4 starts because the zip is not good quality. However, their customer service is awesome and they did a price adjustment for the zipper complaint as I did not have enough time to replacement.


True to size! Beautiful, flowing material!


As others have commented, it is long, but I am 5'3. I ordered a large. I weigh about 175, and am a D cup. It for perfectly! Very flattering.


Very beautiful dress. It fit just the way I wanted it to, considering being 8 months pregnant. Love it!!


very elegant. Wish it had more cushioning or layer in front . but over all really pretty.


This dress fits really well and i am so happy sadly i dont have photos of it on but i will and i will update this soon but it is very beautiful and comfy


Lovely dress, fit good! However I hated the way it was packaged! The material can not be ironed so I had steam it! It was so wrinkled due to packaging, I liked to thought Iâ€™d never get all them out!


did not fit


I ordered a small and got a medium, have dance in 2 days so no time to return. It appears true to size... since it is a size to big for me.


It was nice, but too flimsy for a formal dinner. My husband actually asked if it was lingerie because he could see through the material! I couldn't figure out what sort of slip/bra would work under that open back, so I returned it. Sadness.
