The quality of the dress is not as pretty as pictured. The zipper was not stitched properly as there were some spaces where there were no stitching so unfortunately I had to take it to get fixed. I have to admit i am a bit disappointed


Beautiful, well made, fits true to size, bridesmaids all said it was the most comfortable dress ever!


I ordered this in the size suggested and it fits perfect. I'm 5'4" and the length is perfect in heals. I'll be wearing this for my 25th wedding anniversary party and I can't wait.


I really love the way the dress fits I am a busty person and it's often really hard to find something I can fit in. This dress looked really good on.


Nice dress and very comfortable, fit perfect!!


Nice dress I went up 2 sizes than normal and it fit well.


It was a gift....


I received my dress today . It came early then excepted . It fit great I'm 27 weeks pregnant and I have room to grow since I'll be going to a wedding come September 35 weeks pregnant . Only down fall it's longer then I thought and not as dark in color I ordered the red dress.


It was a little loose for me around the bust and the waist but that was expected since the sizing chart said it was between a 4 and 6 and I'm closer to a 4. It was very comfortable and I have no other complaints!


Beautiful dress. Fits like a glove and is the perfect length with heels. Material looks and feels far more expensive than the price I paid. I Bought this to wear to a formal wedding.
