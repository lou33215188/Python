Comfortable dress. Lace was soft and didn't irritate my skin. I'm 5'7" and the dress was a bit too long with heels.


Great dress for a good price. Fit was as expected. The quality is very good. This was long for me, but I was able to easily get it hemmed.


I bought this as a possibility for an upcoming ball.  It's a pretty and very comfortable dress, but not really formal enough for a ball.


The color is perfect. Looks and feels like a high end dress you would find in a dress shop. Perfect for a wedding


Wow.....amazing dress.  A wonderful slimming fit.  I can't believe the price.


Very pretty and comfortable dress. This was my matron of Honor dress at my best friends wedding. The lace top started to get a little fuzzy as the party went on but it wasn't very noticeable.  Great price too!


GREAT dress! The quality is really good and it's very flattering. You may need to order 1-2 sizes bigger than usual. I ordered the 3XL. I regularly wear XL or XXL. I'm 5'8, wore 4" heels and the length was perfect.


Received my dress according to the delivery time and right on time for the gala. The dress fit perfectly and I received so many compliments.  Several people wanted to know where I purchased my fabulous outfit and I surely did not mind telling them.  Thank you for making my experience a wonderful dream come true.


Dress fits perfect for 5'4" 150lb me. Nice medium weight of fabric for price. I just didn't care for the color once I put it on, so returning.


Absolutely STUNNING!!!  I still can't believe how inexpensive this is for the beauty & quality!  I own it in red as well.
