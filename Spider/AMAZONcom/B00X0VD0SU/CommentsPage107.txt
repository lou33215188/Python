This is a beautiful gown! Fit perfectly-just a touch long but the heels helped not needing alterations.  Rich color! Elegance without the elegant price. Thanks a bunch!!


The dress was more than i expected for the price , i am full figure woman but in this dress i just looked beautiful


the dress appealed  my large breast which pulled the dress up and it cause the chiffon layer to hide my stomach as i walked could not ask for more.


very satisfied


I love this dress and just ordered more from this same designer hoping fir the same results. I'm only 5'1" so I had to hem it up. But I do that with most of my clothes. The fabric is soft and stretchy very comfortable.


I had to return the first dress because the zipper was defective but the second dress was perfect. It is really beautiful. I love the lacey top. I think this dress flatters most figures. My bridesmaids will be wearing them. Great quality dress for the price!


The dress is beautiful I just didn't order appropriate size reordered


Beautiful dress but I was unable to zip it up. Back is lace and see thru. I love this dress and was upset it doesn't fit. In would say this is for 2X not a 3X.


Ordered a medium and it was very big.


the body fits perfect but the length was too long.


love it


Great dress! I sewed some nude-colored lining into the back and shoulders so I could wear it to my brother's wedding, and got lots of compliments! It's SUPER comfortable, too--the lining is like tee-shirt material. The fact that the back is unlined is a little annoying, but can be fixed.
