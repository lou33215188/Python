This is a cute dress that works for a Christmas party.


I'm a 36C and 160lbs and bought a size large. The bust part fits well because the top part of the gown stretches but it's a little tight around the waist. But for the price, one can't go wrong with this dress!!


Wow, this dress is amazing. I may just have to buy it in another color. It's fits very well, stretchy so can accommodate those who are a bit bigger. For reference, I'm 5"5',  32 in just and it just sweeps the floor and sits flush with my body in a size small. Also the pace is very soft and just overall is well made.


Dress fit perfectly and looks amazing!! Great purchase!!


Great dress for the price. Good material. Flowy and fits great. If you go by your bust and waist measurement, then it'll be fine.


This dress was almost perfect! The overlay was too long. But the dress was extremely comfortable, yet looked beautiful! I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone. Definitely follow the size chart. Other than being too long the dress fit great.


Got this for a wedding, super comfy and fit nicely.  Got lots of compliments on it,  no one could believe it came from amazon and was less than $30!!


Cute dress for the price.


IN LOVE WITH THIS DRESS. I plan on wearing it to my brother in laws wedding and its perfect. Super classy and flattering. Im 5'8" and 160lbs and I got a medium. Definitely could've gone with a small as it is stretchy.


soft and lacey in the back.. long and well made.
