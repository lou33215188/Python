THIS DRESS IS PERFECT


being an almost 6' plus size statuess this dress hides all the parts and is a comfortable fit and flare.


FYI ladies don't wear a full bra, tube bra is more comfortable and it will hold ya up ;)


A tiny bit snug but i love it. I wear a 14-16 in dresses and this fit just as I expected it to.


Loved the dress.  The  color red was very pretty.  Wear a size 8 and it fit very well.


I got a xx-l. fits as expected, however it is rather long on me. no big deal though. i am 200 lbs and 5 foot 6 inches, xx-l was a good size to pic.


LOVE THIS DRESS, FITS AS EXPECTED.


Great dress at a great price. I'm a 5'5, 34C and 160 pounds and it fits great and is the perfect length with my heels on.


Beautiful dress, not meant for plus size women. The color was a deep blue, flowed beautifully but just not flattering for a fluffier gal.


Too small. Nice dress though.


Extremely beautiful and flattering dress.  I adore it!


The dress is perfect for a bridesmaid's dress. Bought this dress for my daughter who is 3 months pregnant. It fit her well in the belly area but she probably could have worn an XS for a better fit in the bodice.
