Nice  dress for the price. Lace is soft and dress flows nicely.


Fits really well and is a high quality piece of clothing. Itâ€™s a little long but not too bad.


I REALLY wanted to love this dress, but I felt it looked like a nightgown on me.  I'm almost 5'4 amd 34DD. It just wasn't flattering on me.


Great fabric and fit


Perfect


I wear medium and thought medium would fit but turned out too large and am also a 5' 3 so the dress was too long even with heels on.


The dress is very nice and good quality, but I received it with the hem in the chest area coming undone. I'm afraid it will start to unravel when I wear it.


Stunning. Comfortable and excellent fit. Typically, I wear a size 18, and the xl is the one. Looking forward to a fun night out.


Great Deal... Amazing Dress for the price.


Very nice, long length and comfy!
