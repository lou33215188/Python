I love it. I wore it to direct the chorus. It looked great from the back as well. Very good buy.


This dress is one of a kind! I got so many compliments it's  such a beautiful dress


I have trouble finding the prefect dress for my figure and this dress not only flatters my figure but it makes me feel beautiful and sexy


Fit my daughter perfect and looked great. The rest of this is just filling for Amazon's stupid 20 word minimum review rule.


Is sleeveless when picture shows a little bit of a cap sleeve.  Skirt is not as full as pictured either.  Comfortable dress.


not what I expected, more of a nightgown than a dress.


-Very long and top is see-through.


+Beautiful dress.  Green is a bit more bluish than in the picture, but not as blue as the photos.  Dress is soft and comfortable.  Very happy with it


I absolutely LOVE how this dress fit. It is going to be perfect for a wedding I'm attending in November but I had to return it and get a different color since I found out the bridesmaids dresses are going to be Navy Blue. It was super comfortable and really flattering. I'm excited to get the green dress soon.


I was not expecting the gown to arrive until July 20th, but it actually arrived 2 days after I ordered it on July 14th.  I love the gown and it fits perfectly.  The material is very good quality.  I would definitely order again from Amazon.


The dress came as expected, in good shape. I have to reorder, wrong size was ordered.
