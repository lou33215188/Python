The dress is pretty and fit as expected but I was sent a used dress with cat or dog hair all over it!


Was not as expected. Fabric was not acceptable. Style was not to my liking, or as I thought it would be.


Buying clothes online is hit or miss, this was a definite hit! I felt absolutely beautiful in this dress. It was very comfortable. I luckily had a backless bra so I had no problems in that area. One thing I would warn is it is a little warm. It was hot outside when I wore it so I am not sure if it was the dress or the heat though. lol Regardless I can't wait to wear it again! :)


I ordered this dress for my wedding night after party and dinner and it is beyond beautiful! ğŸ˜� The dress fit just right according to the sizing chart and it's just like its pictured! Looks and feels more expensive than it really is! It's just perfect and I am so excited to show it off next month! ğŸ˜�ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼


Wore the dark green as bridesmaid dress. Fit all of us perfectly, very flattering and I am curvy. Had enough support I didnâ€™t need a bra even. Luckily I like it and will wear it for another special occasion.


this has no real shape it looks more like a nightgown but cute


I ordered the 2xl because I am pregnant and wanted to make sure I would have enough wiggle room to grow since my mothers wedding isn't til Jan., but I have to say it fits nicely and the length was just right!!! For reference: I am 6 months pregs, 5 6" and about 160


Comfortable dress.  Great color.  Wash and hang to dry... can't get easier.


I am size 6 and bought a size 8 thinking I should go up a size (size 6 would've been ok).


The dress it a little plain if you ask me.


I needed something quickly that wasn't too expensive for my sister's wedding because I'm the maid of honor and she decided to plan a wedding in 6 weeks. I wear a size 16 and the 2x fit me perfectly. Good quality, beautiful dress, couldn't be happier!
