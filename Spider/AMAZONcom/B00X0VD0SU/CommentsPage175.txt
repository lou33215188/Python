This dress is absolutely wonderful. I want one in every color! I got so many compliments.


The top of the dress was made a little irregular


Made the bottom of the dress was fine


Nice!


Like the dress. It's "cute". Maybe a bridesmaid dress or maternity photos or to wear to a wedding but it's not really "formal" material if that makes sense. I ordered a large thinking a size up because it ran small. But really it doesn't run small at all, I'm an average size 10, 5'8 and 166 pounds 36dd bust and had to return the large and I ended up ordering a different dress (more ballroom cocktail style) still from Miusol though but in a size medium and it fits PERFECT.


literally was 2 sizes bigger than what it said.


Fast shipping and great material. Very beautiful dress for such a great price! Would def recommend to anyone interested.


Beautiful, great quality, and affordable!


Beautiful nice quality! Would recommend!!


Bought this for my daughter for a special event and it fit beautifully and she looked lovely.


This dress was better than expected. Took it out of the package and put it right on. I'm a size 4 and it fit slightly large but my daughter who is a size 5-6 looks stunning also.
