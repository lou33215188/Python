Beautiful dress and great quality for the price. I had to return mine because it did run a little small.


I would say it runs true to size. I ordered up because I wasn't sure and I was short on time. I'm having it taken in a little and shortened to knee length to fit my needs. But it's an adorable dress and it will work perfect for my Matron of Honor dress. I ordered the green, it's a gorgeous dark green, just what I needed


Love this dress! It is so comfortable & looks amazing on! The only thing that could make it more perfect would be pockets!


The dress was beautiful but the zipper broke off right away. Cheap material.


Fits nice I really like this dress.


I loved the photos but the fabric was lacking in  body making it feel more like a nightgown.  Watch your return dates due to a family emergency (hospitalization) I missed the return date.


Very pretty. I bought it for my daughter.  She went on her first cruise and needed a dress for Captains nite. I didn't want to spend a lot but wanted something nice. This fit the occasion perfectly . I ordered a size larger than her and I was glad I did.


Beautiful, well made.  Green is a lovely color.


For the price, I was rather surprised and quite pleased! It fit just as expected according to the size chart. It was a little short for me, but at over 5'9", I've come to expect that and made it work lol.


I love this dress! Its beautiful! Wearing to a December wedding. Its perfect for a formal or semi-formal event. Its true to size. I'm a 18-20 and got the xxl and its perfect fit!! Great dress for a great price!!!
