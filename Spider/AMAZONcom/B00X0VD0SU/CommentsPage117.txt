Great


This is the only Miusol dress that I have been disappointed with. Looked like a nightgown. Returned it.


Fits fine but I don't care for the waistline on me.


Great quality dress. I'm 5"4' and the dress was a bit long but that's nothing that can't be fixed.


This is a great dress and is good quality. It's a bit long if you are shorter so you may have to get it altered. I'm 5'3" and it was really long on me.  I like the open back and I feel like the dress offers enough support that you can easily go without a bra. (This coming from someone who is a 36DDD)


Beautiful!


Absolutely love it! Got it for my friends wedding and am so please with the quality and how awesome it looks especially for the price!!


I'm usually a size 12 and the XL fit perfectly. I wish it was a little bit longer, I'm 5'3" and wearing heels it's a tad bit shorter than I'd like.


I absolutely love this dress it's well made soft I love the cut from the shoulders not too tight at all a little bit long but wearing some pumps or heels will help them with that


Wore this to my daughter's wedding.  It is a beautiful dress for an amazing price!!!
