Great dress for the price. It stretches some which I love. Great materials. Fit me really nicely. Iâ€™m 5 feet and with 5 inch heels, it was a couple inches off the floor.


I'm so excited to wear this. I am 5'4" and 124lbs and the small fit perfectly. It is a little long but with my 4-5" heels It will be great! The fabric is VERY static but I use Static Guard and just give it a good spray and it makes the dress more willing to flow and not stick to me.


Pretty dress, but there was extra space in the waist area for me, so I ended up returning it. I'm 5'5 and 100 lbs. I got a size S. The dress was definitely long enough but not too long!


My friend chose these for bridesmaid dresses and I was a little apprehensive but it fits great and actually looks really good. Now I'm really glad I got such an affordable bridesmaid dress!


Pretty color.


Loved it but bought the wrong size! Once I bought the right size it fit perfectly! Unfortunately I'll have to figure out adjust the back as I am a larger size chest, I can't use an open back. Great material though!


Perfect for the gala I attended. I'm very pleased with this dress. Flows like a very expensive dress.


I got a small based on their specs and others reviews. It should have fit snugly. Instead it was too big. Really saddening since it is beautiful and we'll made. The lace is so soft and comfortable.


I really like the dress. It is simple, yet flattering. I am 60 kg (132 lbs) and 168 cm (5'6") and my bust size is small (A/B) and I bought an M. The skirt is a bit too long, I'll have to wear it with heels. Additionally, the skirt is heavier than I would have thought (not too heavy), I wouldn't recommend it as a hot summer's dress.


OMG, how can they make this dress for that price? The color is perfect, fits great, hides body flaws and the lace on the back is beautiful. My granddaughter loves this dress. It flows and she floated around the room, said she felt like a princess.
