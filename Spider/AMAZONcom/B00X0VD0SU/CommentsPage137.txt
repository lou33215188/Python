Absolubtely beautiful!


Super fast shipping. My wife was very happy with the product .


Fits great


I loved this dress for the wedding I attended. I also had a friend love it so she purchased it for a wedding in a few months.


I received my dress today in the mail. I like it, however I did receive the same dress that was shown in the picture. Why?


Very nice. Fits great. Good buy


Fits well and the color is beautiful. I have no problem with the length of the dress. Super nice dress, fully recommended


According to the size chart I should where an XL but because of reviews I bought a XXL and it fits like it was tailored for me. The length is perfect (I'm 5'8"). Love this!


Perfect for a bridesmaid dress!  Nobody could believe the price.  It was comfortable and flattering!!!


A  lovely black dress that can stand out with the right accessories! Fits my budget.
