Love this dress! It's my second one the first in black and this one in green, the color is a forest winter green, very lovely!


Beautiful dress and exceptional price.

Just what I wanted! So elegantly made. I can't wait to wear it for my baby shower.

Also The color is not exactly as in the photo. Could you please let me know How can I return this product and get credit?


Thank you

Beautiful gowns for 30 bucks! My bridesmaids ordered these and I actually have BM's that literally are M to 3XL and everyone loved theirs!


This dress was incredibly long and I am a tall woman. At 5'8" if I had not worn heels I would have needed to have it hemmed.


Very comfortable. Fast shipping. The lace was very soft. I am 5'9 and with flats on the dress was the perfect length. Tall girls need to wear flats with this dress.


This dress is absolutely stunning, and makes you feel very good about wearing it! Beautiful formal dress for a very good price. In my opinion, you get more for your money!


PERFECT. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS DRESS FOR YOUR BRIDESMAIDS, BUY IT. Fits great and comfy. I'm 5'5 and it hangs a little on the ground but it's fine if you wear heels. Amazing for the price. So worth it!
