Dress is great quality, especially for the price! Color is exactly as pictured. I'm very happy with this dress.


Pretty much perfect. I'm really petite, so this dress was really long on me. If I had time, I probably could have gotten it tailored (just the length, though), but wearing stilettos worked out well enough. Looks gorgeous and flattering!


Excellent product, I'm really happy with this dress and hope to used soon. Everything is perfect, the color is exactly as the picture,


I wear a size large, so that is what I ordered, and it fit perfect!! The fabric is nice and the dress is really comfy!


Beautiful dress


The dress is beautiful for the price. Mine was just a little too snug, so I will be returning it.


My daughter wore it to her graduation and piano recital.  She looked great!


Bought the red and it was not the color in the picture. It was bright red and shiny. I was very disappointed in the color.


Beautiful dress, great fabric I love it
