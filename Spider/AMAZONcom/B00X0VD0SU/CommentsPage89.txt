It is as shown in picture. Size accurate, material as seen and described. This is my second purchase of dresses from this brand and both times pleased


Good quality gown for the price. Flattering style for most body types.


Beautiful and a great price!... Size as expected ...Thank you!!


BEWARE! I bought this dress because it looked very flattering in the pictures and the reviews were great, however, I received a completely different dress. This one was hideous, made of cheap fabric, and had long sleeves. Now I am responsible for returning it! Very disappointed.


Beautiful dress!! Did come a little smaller than I thought.. I’m normally a large but got an xl just in case and it’s a little snug.. from the wait down it’s perfext and flows nice


I purchased this gown based on the reviews.  I usually wear xl, however I bought the xxl and it fit like the model.  The royal blue was true to form.  I received it really fast.  Will recommend to anyone.  I pinned a dimante broach to the front mid-section to add that formal look.


I cannot wait to wear my new gown to my daughter's grad.


Very happy with my purchase, lovely dress. The only thing I wasn't happy with was that the blue dress was very super dark blue, almost a black/blue


I wore this dress to my friends wedding last night and it was perfect! I got soooo many compliments on it. I wear an 18/20 normally and the 3x was perfect on me. The only “complaint” is that I wish the waist was a bit lower like it seems to be on the model.


Love this dress. It fits perfectly and is of great quality for the price! Can't wait to order more dresses from this brand. Size was exactly what I'd buy in a store for those curious.


Dress fits small in the bust otherwise its great....
