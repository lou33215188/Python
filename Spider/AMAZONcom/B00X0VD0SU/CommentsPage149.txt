Wonderful quality for an amazing price! Fit perfectly!  I am 5ft 2in and 130 lbs and ordered a size small.


I don't think I've ever had a dress fit this badly... I mean, you get clothes that don't quite fit right but wow, is this what a medium is? I've NEVER IN MY LIFE have needed to have a dress tailored before. My friend picked this as her bridesmaid dress, so I didn't have much of a choice. I measured myself and deemed the medium the best option. It was a quarter of a foot too long (and I'm average height), and the shoulders were somehow too big, but the waist fit ok? I had to pay $90 to have it tailored. NINETY DOLLARS. More than twice the worth of this dress. I couldn't just order a small because then that would be TOO small and I'd have to have it taken out.


I'm not joking, I've never had this weird of a fit from a dress before. Will be sure to never order from this company by choice. If I didn't need it for a wedding, I would have gotten a refund.


Also, I've never had an issue with empire waist on my body type. But for some reason it looked super weird on me this time. Not to mention the bride didn't think it was empire waisted in the first place.


Dress fit as expected. I wanted an inexpensive dress for a formal event and this fits the bill.


I'm not returning the merchandise. I did receive 2 of the same dresses but have since decided to give one of them to my friend. Beautiful dress.


I'm 5'2 and this dress was definitely too long for me but otherwise very pretty.


I love this dress however being a small/short person the dress was too big. I was able to take it in and am looking forward to wearing it!


Dress fits as expected although it is very long. But for $30, I can have it hemmed no problem.


The dress was exactly as it appears online. I wish i was that size but im not. Lol but i brought it anyway to wear for christmas.
