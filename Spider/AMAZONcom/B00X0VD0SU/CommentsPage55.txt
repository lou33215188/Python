It's just like the photo, it's pretty, but it's super see-through on the front! Like 50% opacity... I wish it wasn't I Iove the dress! You could sew lining into the front?


this looks just like the picture, and is absolutely beautiful. Word to the wise though, wear a nude or black bra with it. The top portion is a little more see through than I expected


I love the style. You have a classic romantic gift. My husband was overly please with the sudden beauty of the dress and I love how nicely it fits. Extremely comfortable! Simply enchanting!


Way too long, but gorgeous dress.  (I am 5'6" but can't wear heels because of my back.) Beaufiful dress though.


I really love this dress, especially for the price. I am a 38 D and the XL fit perfectly. I also have like 44in hips and the bottom was still flowy and didn't stick or feel too tight. Wearing for a wedding in the spring.


Yes I loved how it looked it was  bit long and my armpits started turning blue ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜’but other than that I liked it


For the price the product is okay. I definitely don't think it's a nice piece to wear to a wedding. It looks too cheap but again, for the price it's good. This time the reviews on the product did not help with my buying. :(


It did the job when i went to the wedding... But i was expecting a little better quality.


If you're a a short person you'll more than likely have to wear high high heels or get this hemmed before the big day arrives.  Beautiful dress everyone loved it!  Wear a size 14-16 ordered XL


I received compliments when I wore this as a bridesmaid dress however I found out after I made a purchase that other online stores are selling the exact same product for less price, should have shopped around.  I was very careful closing and opening the back as well as it seems to easy to rip the material.
