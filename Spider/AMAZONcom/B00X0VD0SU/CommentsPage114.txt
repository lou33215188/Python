The dress was uber cute. I was SO excited to try it on...until it didn't fight :(


My issue is that it was a little tight around the arms, and I couldn't get the zipper to go up all the way :/


I ordered based on the size chart, and this dress fits like a glove! Very flattering and comfortable-and you can't beat the price! I'm very excited to wear it :)


unbelievably  excellently  beautiful.everyone who has class and style should buy this dress.i bought one green and one navy.


I love it! It's a bit snug on top but that's because I'm blessed. Fits and looks awesome!


Bought this dress for my daughter for a formal event. The top is more sheer than can be seen in the photos, but with a nude camp and a shawl, it covered nicely. Can be dressed up or down depending on what you want. True to size (she's a size 3)


The Material was very flimsy and it did look cheap + it was way too large for a size medium.


This package arrived very fast and the dress is so nice, the lace is soft like I like and I'm so glad they used a cotton liner, very breathable, light and flowy. I love how the dress huggs me in the right places baby!


Not what I thought it was.


Love this dress. Wore this dress to formal dinner and was perfect


Love it so beautiful and comfatable so happy about the length because im tall perfect would love to by this in a another color soon thank you so much...
