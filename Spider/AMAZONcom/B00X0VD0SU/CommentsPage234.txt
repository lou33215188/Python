I looked at the size chart and a 12 was an xl....it fit perfect. Cheap and comfy! Had to steam so take out be4 you wear it!


I wore this dress to a wedding it was very pretty and very comforatable.


Ordered this dress & received completely different dress..


This dress is perfect. It's light, comfy, and the material is super soft. Also, it's beautiful. The lace and chiffon make this a great bridesmaid, prom, or just a formal dress for any occasion. The delivery was also quicker than expected. I highly recommend this dress.


I bought it to wear to a wedding. The red was much brighter than the picture indicated, but that wasn't a problem. It didn't fit me, though, as the small was too big. I sort of expected this because I have a very small frame. If you're on the small or petite side, this dress won't suit you. It is quite pretty, though it got wrinkled in delivery. A little steaming would fix it up just fine. The quality seems okay for the price, pity it didn't fit.


Love the dress! the waist is a little higher then shown in the photo! But perfect for the price!!


Was perfect for my maternity photoshoot!! Loved red color..


This dress is good, the length is perfect and the style is something that everybody is sure to be interested at, its timeless!


Its beautiful dress. Its little too long, little too dark green for me.


I ordered a medium and I'm 5'4 and 160. It was a perfect fit! The dress overall was beautiful!
