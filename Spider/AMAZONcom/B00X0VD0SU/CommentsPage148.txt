l wanted so badly to love this dress.I really liked the feel of the material and the flow of the dress. But, the zipper was not sewn in correctly which made the dress bunch up right over the my butt. Had to return it.


I’m 5”1’ and 110 lbs. it’s a tad big, but I think with a jeweled belt it will be perfect. Happy with this purchase.


very nice for the price


While it is beautiful and made well, I am 5' 2"


Waaaaay too long


Little long and a bit roomy but still beautiful


I was very pleased, the dress fit wonderfully.  I received numerous complements at the Holiday party I attended.


Fits fine. It's very long. The top is a little more see-through than I expected.


Beautiful dress! True to size. Only minus for me is the see through back.


Good quality and looks.  Fit as expected.


Dress seemed to be well made and was very pretty. I wear a size 12 and am 5'7". I bought the XL. Length was good for heels, size fit well but it was a bit too low cut.
