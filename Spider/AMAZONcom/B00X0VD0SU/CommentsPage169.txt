I like it a lot.  It fits perfectly.


Nice dress.  It just fit too small.  I will be returning it.


There were stains where the bodice and skirt meet. I was extremely disappointed with the quality. It's unwearable.


Reminded me of a cheap nightgown.  Not very flattering.


The dress fit well but the red in the picture is not the red that you get. I looked like a fire engine!  It was awful. I'm returning it tomorrow.


It was great. was very very very good for the price


Looks cheap will return it


The dress was very pretty. It was a little hard to get on and off due to being tight, but the seam where the zipper is just didn't lay right in the back,


It was a nice dress and fit well on the top but didn't fit me the way I wanted. I will be returning this weekend sorry
