Perfect


I wore this to my Nephews wedding..really pretty.


Wish I could have returned this. It was a big N O in person.


Words can't express how much I looooove this dress. It feels so soft and casual but looks amazing. Will be ordering in every color. I ordered one for myself before I asked my bridesmaids to get one-for quality purpose and I was so excited!! I love it!


This looked great on. Very soft and very comfortable.


Made me look like an old lady


Returned the dress. Looks like a fancy nightgown. The entire bodice is see through. Guess that's what you get for a $30 dress from China.


I am 5'5 1/2 127 lbs and I ordered the size Small due to another reviewers suggestion to order based on bust size. The top is stretchy so the small was just fine up top, and the high waist line and flowing bottom makes it so anyone who wears a small size 2 to medium ish size 7 could easily wear it. It's a really pretty dress, and I absolutely love it. Only bad thing is it was full of static when I opened it, so much that it was hard to try it on immediately as it just kind of clung to my body. Fit was great though, quality is great, everything was just perfect! It is pretty long though, so I do recommend at least small heels with it. I wore 5" heels with it and it was only a couple inches off the ground.


I love the dress, quality material and the fit and length are perfect.  I normally wear a 18/20 or XL, plus  I am 5'7" and busty.  I ordered the dress in 3x because I was afraid that it would run small or be too snug.  By ordering up 2sizes the dress fits exactly as I hoped it would.  Great Buy and I will definitely order it again in a different color.


I wore this to my sons wedding. It fit beautifully!  I received many compliments and was very comfortable in this dress. I love that it is machine washable. Highly recommend.
