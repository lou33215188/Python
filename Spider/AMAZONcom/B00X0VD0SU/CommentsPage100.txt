I loved the dress. Very comfortable.  Light weight and flowy Wore it to my churches Christmas gala. Shipped very quickly. I believe it arrived Wednesday and i ordered on a Saturday night.  The only small problem was it was a little thin. Depending on the color you may want to consider support garments.


Dress was lovely! I got a medium at 5'3 135lbs because I don't like tight dresses much! This one could have been smaller but the medium gave me some room! If you like you dresses tight buy a size smaller because the lace has a lot of give!


This dress is so cute and fit perfectly! Incredibly comfortable. Would recommend to anyone. I'm 130 lbs and 5'7. I got the small and it's great.


The dress feels amazing on the body. I bought it is a maternity dress and got many compliments on it! It fit perfectly


Perfect and very easy to take care of


Looks more elegant in the picture than it actually is in person


My wife picked this out and loves it. It was just a TAD too large, but after a wash and dry it fits perfectly and looks wonderful.


This dress is very nice! It fits good with lots of stretch around the bust. I am very pleased with this dress! Good quality alot better than I expected for the price :)


Perfect
