I'm 5'8" & weigh 190, I ordered the navy color dress, size 3X (on purpose) I wanted the dress to be long I knew the dress was going to be big on top but I didn't really care because I was going to make the top smaller. I think I would have been ok with a size large but I'm not sure about the length on the large. The dress touched the floor & dragged a little but that's exactly what I wanted,, FYI I wore flats. I wasn't sure what kind of bra I was going to wear but I ended up finding a backless sticky bra at target for like $25, I think I would have been fine with a nude color bra as well. The pictures I posted are not the best but it will give you an example of how long the dress was & what the navy color dress looks like. Overall I liked the dress & I got a lot of compliments on it.


Really good quality for the price. I always get scared ordering dresses online because of my body type. It's only 4 stars because it's really long but I can wear heels or make it to where it's not too long. The top is see through so I suggest wearing a nude bra or a bra that matches the color of the dress or go bra less whatever works for you. lol I bought a size XL because people with size C boobs said a L fit perfectly and I am bigger chested. I'm 165 pounds, 5"5, size 36D, and a big butt. Lol the dress fits perfectly and under the boobs and down (I guess the waistline that everyone keeps saying is to high)  is flowy and hides my pudgy belly. Very beautiful!


I purchased this dress for a formal event. I was worried it would not look "formal" enough due to the price. The dress is pretty simple, the red is a vibrant red, and the lace is very pretty, surprisingly soft, not itchy, and doesn't look cheap. Dressed up with accessories the dress works for a formal.


I found the reviews very helpful sizing wise. I'm 5'3" ish, 195 lbs and a 40DD. My usual dress size is an 18. I ordered the XXL. The dress fits comfortably and is tight enough in the bust that wearing a bra isn't necessary. Length wise 2-3 inch heels work for me without the dress touching the floor. With the bust area being tight enough to secure the girls, it creates fat rolls in my back that I can see through the lace. I ordered the XXXL in Navy. (Red wasn't in stock) Going up a size is still supportive in the bust and elimated the visible unwanted roll. Both dresses fit, I can easily wear the XXL, but if you are prone to the dreaded roll like I am, the XXXL might be a better, smoother fit.


This dress is stunning. The ONLY downside is that the material takes a while to iron out, but once those wrinkles are gone, it's just magnificent. I added a belt, because I add belts to just about everything to accentuate my waist, and as you  can see, it looks like something that is upscale and expensive. TOTAL STEAL! I wore it  to a wedding and received many compliments from the guests and the servers! If you're thinking about buying this - do it! It's also a PERFECT fit. I usually get mediums in tops, and since that's where it's tighter, in the top, I ordered a medium. It wasn't too tight, it wasn't loose, it was perfect to be comfortable and pretty. Beautiful dress!


I'm 5'3" and 115lbs and unfortunately it doesn't come with the boobs... ğŸ˜† but otherwise I love this dress!  I wore it to a formal fall wedding.  It's comfortable and looks great!  It's a steal for the price.  The construction is good... Material to be expected...


I got the xs and it was long on me even with high heels.  The double sided tape hem trick doesn't work on this fabric, but someone taller than me could still wear this.  It's semi stretch fit so someone with a bigger bust (Or any bust...) could definitely fit into it nicely.


The hard part was figuring out a bra that didn't detract from the back... But if you're flat chested like me... It frankly just isn't as flattering...


If you are at all on the fence about getting this dress... JUST GET IT! I was blown away by the quality, feel, and fit of this dress for the price. I am always terrified of buying clothes on Amazon because so often they are not using US sizing and I am on the edge of plus sized being a 16/18 depending on the cut of the dress. I got a 2x, and it fit like it was made JUST for ME! I didn't get any pictures of the open lace back, but it was a total show stopper! I got SO MANY COMPLIMENTS on this dress. The lace was soft and had a little stretch. The skirt of the dress was multilayered so while it had a sheer top layer, you definitely will not need a slip. The material was so forgiving. I would normally wear shapewear or spanx to a formal event, but I didn't even need to in this dress! I did have to buy a backless bra, but I got a good deal on one so it wasn't even a big investment. I would buy this dress 100 times.


This dress is perfect. I feel like I paid less than what it is worth. Absolutely breath taking. The fit is classic and I am soooo happy with this purchase. You will not regret buying this dress. Just wow.


Dress is great! Im 5'3ish and 165lbs and 38B/C. I ordered the XXL since there are no options for number sizes. Its almost too big. I am thinking I may exchange for a XL. Its REALLY long on me and a little too big in the top since it will stretch out. I did not even have to unzip it. just slipped it over when I tried it on. Not sure whet the other reviews are talking about with sizes? Most of them mention a number size?? Must have been a different dress. The dress itself is pretty plain. I ordered a rhinestone dress belt/band to dress it up. The material is nothing special in to top, just your regular stretchy 'lace'. It has nothing for cover in the back so you would need to go bra-less or with no shows. Again I am 5'3 so the XXL top actually goes to the mid section of my ribs. I would rather the top section go right my "top section" so the belt makes since. The material is really not worth getting altered. You could alter yourself at home and it would be just as good to save money if needed. Overall the dress is not bad for the price. AGAIN, Keep in mind MY dress ran a little big for MY size. It has some stretch to the material.


I am usually a bust 39, waist 30, hips 39... so this was a surprise fit. It is super snug, and a bit smaller than expected, but I have worn this to many events (including a "recommended black tie" event, a limo-worthy event, and a girl's night out). Length is long enough that I need heels as a 5'4" human. I think braless is definitely the way to go. Should not need pasties unless you are super worried about going to a cold event where you might... peak at certain points in the dress.


Very nice dress. It's fits well, but as others said, the lace on the torso ends higher than expected. To compensate for that, I put an overbust corset underneath. It seemed to help. 34-26-36 ordered a small. Overall, I'm happy with this dress.
