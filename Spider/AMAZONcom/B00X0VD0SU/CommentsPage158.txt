Returned - too large for a 4


True to size and well made.  I won't hesitate to buy from this company again.


Awesome


Very pretty dress. I'm 5 months pregnant and needed a dress for a wedding. The dress is beautiful and very good quality for the price but not good as a maternity gown. Would've been perfect if I wasn't pregnant


Fit perfect-made really well-cant wait to wear it at my son'd wedding this summer


Beautiful, ordered medium fits comfortably, plenty of room,  normally wear size 8


It was just as pretty as the pictures


Great dress!


for a friend so not sure about details


Pretty dress but I received a size smaller than I ordered and my event is in 4 days
