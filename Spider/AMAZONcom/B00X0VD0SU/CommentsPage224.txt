I liked the dress, but I ordered size M and instead received a size S.


Too small.  The lace at the arms rubbed.  Zipper was stiff.  It was returned.


There is a snag in the fabric on the bottom of the dress.


I wouldn't know. The dress arrived with a broken zipper


Gorgeous recital dress got so many compliments


I was very excited to wear this as maid of honor for my sister's wedding yesterday. However, I spent 30 minutes cutting of strings of thread that stuck out everywhere. Apparently I missed one and it got caught on my shoe which tore a huge hole into the side of the dress as i walked down the aisle. Such an embarrassing moment and I would never recommend this dress to anyone!!!!


I just received my dress and it was NOT EVEN CLOSE to the same dress pictured. They sent me a cheap strapless cotton knee length beach dress. Not even close to what was pictured in style.


wrong style for me but very nice quality and customer service


I read a comment about the bust area so went with the extra large and it's perfect -- slips on easily and is super comfortable and complimentary.  Lining is also good.  Since I don't like the looks of my arms in sleeveless dresses I will be wearing a shawl or some cover over my arms but I am looking forward to an occasion to wear it.  Perfect for what I was looking for (but always looking for cap sleeves or 2/4 sleeves).


Loved the Fit! it was perfect on me!
