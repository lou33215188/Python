very comfortable love this dress had it tailored it's one of my best dress


Surprisingly great quality for the price- I wore this to a wedding and got so many compliments! It fit like it was made for me and looked just like the photos!


I love this dress, it does run long. I'm 5'8" and I'm stepping on it. I'll need to pin up somehow. That's my only complaint.


Yes love the dress !! But the back above your butt there is a weird pilling in the fabric which I do not like and I do not have a small butt. if it was gone this dress would be perfect!!


Horrible quality looks nothing like it did in the picture


Runs way smaller than you would expect


This looks like way more than a $30 dress. It fits wonderfully. I can't wait to wear it out :)


Quite beautiful but runs very small.


When I got this dress the back side was stuck together dress cheaply made


Its extremely comfortable but looks more like a nightgown on than a formal dress... I'll probably still keep it for an everyday type of wear instead of its intended formal wear
