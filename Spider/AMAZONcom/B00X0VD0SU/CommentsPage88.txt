Gorgeous dress, loved the way it fit. Bought a size 2x. I normally wear a size 16. My bra size is a 44DD which is why I went with the larger size. I did wear a silicone bra. I've read other reviews where some people went braless, I'm not that brave. The deep V is a little revealing. I'm 5'8" and the length was fine even with heels. I wore this to my aunt's retirement party which was a formal event. I received lots of compliments.


Dress arrived with 2 stains on it (discoloration). Also, the top is see through! And the shoulders were not embellished- not as depicted in photo at all! Very disappointed. The tag wasnt even attached so I'm wondering if it was a return that they just re-sold? If so, bad quality care!


wore it to a party and loved it.


It fits well! It's a little long, but then I'm only 5'3". I was really excited to get this dress and I'm. It disappointed at all.


Beautiful dress. But sizes are true. There is no give. I have been a size six for the past twenty years. Glad I bought a large. Ask me again next weekend after the event.


The dress is great, but slightly big.  i am having it altered.


Lovely dress. The skirt part has two layers making it much warmer than the top of the dress. Not so great for a summer event


Perfect formal dress for my event. Would definitely purchase from this company again. Great Job!


Too small and too long, I am a petite height.  Beautiful dress just not for me.


Love the color and the material! It's very breathable and flowy.  I'm 5'4" and 120 pounds and it's only slightly too long. The fit around my waist was a little big, but enough room to eat and drink without being uncomfortable. I plan to wear this to a couple of Mardi Gras balls, and it's so comfortable!
