Fits well. Flows nicely. Hopefully after being packed in a suitcase it won't come out too wrinkled.


Love this dress! Really good quality for the price. Fits great. I am between size 12-14 and the xlarge is a perfect fit.


I ordered this dress very last minute for a wedding - it arrived in 1 day and in perfect condition. I was shocked that despite being folded in a bag when it arrived, the dress had no wrinkles. The quality was excellent for the price paid. Very flattering dress. I highly recommend.


It's a beautiful dress! More than I expected. I did have to shorten it a bit,bcuz I can't wear heels,but otherwise it's lovely and came sooner than I expected as well.


This dress is stunning! The lace back is gorgeous, the length is perfect and the chest doesn't have a strong V neck so your tatas aren't just all over the place! The fit was perfect and just as expected!


Wore this for my friends wedding. I was bridesmaid and 7 months pregnant. I am 5’8”. Dress was perfect length to wear flats. So comfortable and light. The day of the wedding was like 100degrees. Would def recommend this dress


Fits nicely even though I bought a bigger size because I wanted it shipped on Prime.


Can't believe how good the quality of this dress is, especially for the price!  Fits as expected and is beautiful!  Very happy!


LOVELY DRESS, FITS AS EXPECTED. I BOUGHT A XXXL. I am 235lb and approx 5'6".  Beautiful dress.  Just as pictured.


It ran big but the material was very thin. I wore a slip but then the straps showed through the lace on the shoulders. I still wore it but it wasn’t a favorite.
