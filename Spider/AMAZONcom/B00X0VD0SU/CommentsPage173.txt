The top is sheer.


Love!  Fits wonderful.  I am a 18/20.  Wonderful, wonderful!


The dress is beautiful and worth the price you pay. It is smaller then the regular size!


This dress surprisingly fit me really well. I wear it once a week. Washes well in the laundry and no shrinkage from the dryer.


Fits true to size!


It looked just like the photo but was too big :(


Me queda un poco corto de tronco


this item fits as expected unless youre plus size. I would suggest going a size bigger.


It's a lovely dress. The fit was as it said on the site. Which was a relief!


Very nice dress. Fast delivery, very satisfied.
