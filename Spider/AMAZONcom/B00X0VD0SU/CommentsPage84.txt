This dress looks so good. It runs true to size. It's well made and no one would've guessed that I bought it for less than $35 on Amazon.


Love it. Looks good and is super nice. I'm 5'10, 160 lbs, and a 36C. I bought a large and it was super flattering. Not like red carpet quality, but it looks good!


Pretty color, just wish it was a little more fitted in the bodice.


Beautiful but slightly drapery, I read the reviews and opted for the larger size. It is too long and needs taken in as well. I love the lace look. The fit is slightly too loose though. Ordered Large, 5'8", 148lbs, larger in the chest are but it's still a bit loose.


Got this dress to wear for maternity pictures. I was not sure about the sizing but it is pretty true to size. Fit perfectly and I know it is versatile to wear again. The back is low so it does present a problem with the bra situation but I liked the lacy details. Great purchase.


For the money, this was a very good purchase.  I absolutely agree with others that the waist is very high, so look at other people's photos before purchasing because the model photo waist length is not the product you'll get.  But, again, for the price, I was very pleased..


The dress is simply beautiful!!! I was a little scared that it might not fit, but I was pleasantly surprised it fit my size exactly. The only alteration was in length cause it was too long.The material is soft and comfortable and it looks really fancy. It was a great buy!!


Beautiful  and sinple, waist hit a little higher than  expected though


Beautiful dress! Comfortable to wear it all day. Received many compliments. I'm a L and XL was perfect, but because I'm 5'01 it was way too large! I had to get it fixed. Received it on time. Love my dress!


Very good quality, especially for the price. Very pleased with this purchase.
