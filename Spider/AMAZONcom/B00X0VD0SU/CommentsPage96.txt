Really comfortable and flattering fit.  A bit on the long side so if you're < 5'4" I wouldn't recommend


Dress looked great.


Way too long, but it is a beautiful dress.


Very comfortable and flowy. I have a little wider hips and shoulders so it was hard to get into it but fit well on.


Looks a lot like a nightgown, but it's comfortable and fit well


Such an easy and glamorous dress.  I am in between sizes and this dress was comfortable and fit well.  So many compliments!


Lovelybut a bit too large. Have to close on it but it's pretty.


I love this dress. I did have to hem the bottom because I'm 5'4". Measurements are made for the bust.  I was a little disappointed that the fabric underneath the lace is like a soft flannel  instead of a chiffon.  But I have no other regrets about this dress.  It's very beautiful


If you are looking for a plus size dress this is it. Great fabrics, elegant look and it does stretch. Simply amazing.


Nice dress, great price
