I love the dress but when I went to have it hemmed because I'm only 5'3" the seamstress had to take the whole dress apart because the back was stitched all wrong and it was not laying right. There was also a hole in the dress. It's costing me more to fix it than the actual price I bought it for.


Very nice dress, fits well, good quality for the price.


This worked perfectly for my Halloween costume. #missscarlet #clue


The dress was ok. The material was a little lower quality than what I expected. But it fit perfect and looked good.


Very nice, pretty dress. Seems like it could be used in both formal and casual situations if dressed up or down. Super comfy too!


I like the dress but if you are really big chested, go with something else. I'm a size 20 5'9" 42G bra. Would do fine for a smaller chest


I purchased this for a bridesmaids dress for a wedding I am in. I love the look, the fit, and the length. Very, very pleased with this purchase! I did take all of my measurements beforehand to be sure I bought the right size and it's perfect!!!


This is a very pretty dress. Good quality fabric and a price you can't beat. I'm having to give it 3 stars as it's going to need some extra work if I keep it. The lace top had a very thin lining in the front and is see thru and unwearable unless I want the world to see my tatas the first time a flash goes off.


Beautiful dress! So comfortable! I put this dress on and I never want to take it off! I'm wearing it with a stick on bra because the back is lace. I bought this for a wedding I'm attending! Thank you Amazon for always coming through last minute!


much nicer than expected! very pleased
