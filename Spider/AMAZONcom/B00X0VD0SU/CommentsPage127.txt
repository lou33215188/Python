Stunning


Nice dress. Good quality. Size was quite bigger than I expected.


Loved this dress it was perfect.


didn't  fit well.


Gorgeous dress and looks good on. It would look better if I was sent the correct size. I ordered a large but was sent a medium. Oh well I guess.


5â€™4, 127 pounds, you gotta have some big boobies for this to be somewhat flattering :/ you can take it in but I just thought it looked awkward. Will be returning


Very very comfortable! Great price as well! It definitely does not look expensive though but it gets the job done.


This dress is GORGEOUS fits really well! I can not believe how cute it is and for the price a steal!


Beautiful dress!
