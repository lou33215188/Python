It was my first time to order a dress and good thing I read reviews even before buying. I bought a medium but I usually wear a large ( I am not busty) it really fits very well :)  Material of the dress is not cheap. Worth it!


Once i saw in person i didn't like it until I put it on, little long, could a been a little more fitted but otherwise i love it! I may be prettier than the bride!


Beautiful dress and I love the color!  It also is VERY comfortable and the material is soft and breathable.  Really good fit as well.


Worked out great for my wedding, the bridesmaids love it and it fit very well. They were all different sizes and none of them needed alterations.


This dress was stunning! I was nervous to order online due to being afraid it wouldn't fit. It was for a wedding but it fit just right and it's prettier in person! My favorite dress by far!


Dress fits as size requested. Very pretty navy blue color. Had a wonderfull feedback of dress. Afterall a very good quality dress highly recommend.


A beautiful dress, better than expected. Looks like a $100.00 dress. Fits perfectly.


Thank you.


Purchased to wear to a wedding while nearly 7 months pregnant. It fit great and continues to accomodate a growing belly. I received many compliments and look forward to wearing it again.


Fits perfect. I have very big breast and have always had problems finding tops or dresses that fit without them popping out or being squished. This dress fits me perfectly, and comfortably!
