I like the fit, color and length. However I felt the material of the dress could have been better.


However I was happy with the purchase,


Top part of dress is completely see through in the front and back...not just the back as described. Also the waist is much higher than in the pictures.


The customer photos are true, this dress looks great on any body type. I bought this dress for a wedding and I wasnt disappointed. The fabric is nice and very comfortable and the price is amazing. Don't pass it up.


We purchased this dress for a bridesmaid dress.  It's a beautiful color of green, and the lace top is very pretty.


These dresses were great! Everyone's fit very well. Only problem we had is that they were very long, but that can be easily fixed. They are made well and look amazing!


Very flowy and complimented my pregnant figure.


I'm 5'4" and 105 lbs.  The small was more of a medium, and about 3 inches too long.


Nice, simple dress, but needs alterations.


Itâ€™s ok! The material is a little thin


Read the reviews and based my purchase off them! It fits great! It has a stretch to it that makes it comfortable! So excited to wear! Great purchase! It's beautiful!


Looks wonderful!
