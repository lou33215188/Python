The 2x fit like it was a Large.  It wasn't even close. I wear 1x in most dresses but got this bigger as a just in case.  It couldn't even zip in the back.


However, very easy to return to company and quick refund. Great customer service.


Beautiful gown, definitely packing some heels to go with it, it is long. Fits great, can't wait to see it in the photos we take on vacation ^-^


Fits amazing, wish the sleeves were a more 'capped' but the event is in the Fall so my Arm's will be covered most the time anyway.


Color was not accurate.


Fast shipping fit good on size but a little long but will do can't beat the price fir a bridemaids dress


got it for Halloween order 3X.  I'm  a 40 DD on top.  nice dress I'm happy with it, may cute it short and wear again.


Lovely dress.


The dresses is beautiful. It's smooth texture against your skin feels sexy. The upper back lace is gorgeous. Overall, is top quality for low low price.


The dress was very long, I had it hemmed and sewed cups into the front; you cannot wear any bra with a back strap on it.  With those modifications, It is a lovely dress, flowing and elegant. The lace is soft and comfortable and lays nicely.


I absolutely love this dress. Fits perfect and is so pretty!
