I really love this dress. The top lace is a little see through, so I hesitate a star for that. Love the material and very comfortable.


I love this dress. It hugs wonderfully, and falls wonderfully.


I liked this dress from the front but I'm going to return it.  I'm 5'3 so it's a couple inches too long for me but I would have tried to make it work with higher shoes if it had not been for the back of the dress.  The lower part of the zipper does not lay flat when you have the dress on so it sticks out making a weird bump on your butt.  At first I thought it was ruching but when I took the dress off and looked at it I realized it wasn't.  Maybe the dress I received was defective in some way.  I will say that I had a baby 3 months ago and as soon as I put this on I kind of wished I was still pregnant because this dress would be so great as a maternity dress for an event.


True to size. All though Iâ€™m in between medium and small it fits well and very beautiful dress. Colors on point navy blue. And no loose string.


Make sure you measure! It's a nice dress but not for formal wear, bought for my daughter's wedding but it's not wedding worthy.


This is a beautiful dress, but it was too long. I am 5'1'' and had to alter it 5 inches.


Gorgeous gown and cannot wait to wear for formal around Christmas.  Only thing is that the skirt portion is too long for me (I'm 5'4") so I will have to have it hemmed.  Otherwise, a beautiful product!


Fantastic material. Absolutely love it. I'm short so the length is perfect. The only complaint is that the bust was a little big because my size is approximately 36 and there's only 35 and 37


Love love love. Fit perfect. I wear a XL so I ordered a XXL. Wouldn't change a thing. Yes it is very long. I'm 5'3 and it is very long, you have to wear heels. Looks perfect.


I love it It fit just right for my bridesmaid, thank you so much great dress looks just like the picture awesome.
