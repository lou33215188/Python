It's beautiful


I ordered new dress but received used one without tag and was smelling nasty


Likes: beautiful color, shape of gown. Dislikes: ridiculously long, too big all over but esp in the bust. Worst of all: the cheap-feeling fabric. It just made me feel dirty even touching it. I wore this for a formal event and will probably give it away next time I go to Goodwill. I gave it a 2 because of the nice color and because it more or less got the job done.


It looks elegant on the picture...looks like a sleeping gown when I got itğŸ˜¢


Love it.  It's a little long but I'm short so that was expected


This dress is so soft and great quality!! Highly recommend


This dress is fabulous looking for the price!!!


A surprisingly great find!


amazing dress but its tallest than expect.


Great dress for $30!
