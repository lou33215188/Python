Excellent fit, but slightly long on my frame. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.


So beautiful! I love it. I thought there would be a problem with my bust size since I recently stoped breast feeding but this is perfect.


Thank you the dress fit perfect. Shipping was fast. Dress is really nice and I just love dark colors


We all loved the dress


Really comfortable and true to size!


Returned


Looks better in picture, then after I received it.


Pretty but not what was expected


The lining in front looked a little thin and see through.  It's extremely long.  I did not end up wearing.


It was what I wanted.  I loved the color but I need one size larger.
