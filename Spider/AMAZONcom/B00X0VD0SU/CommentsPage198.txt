Got here 2 days early which was great.  I wore it for an event and got a lot of complements.  It was comfortable too.


To big


Very see through in front


looks great on my girls !


Fast and accurate and exactly what we wanted!


a little long


Beautiful fit.


Great dress especially for the price. It came quickly and was perfect. I'm right between a 14/16 women's and the XXL was perfect. I'm 5'7 and I'll definately have to wear at least 2-3 inch heels to keep it from dragging. It is a good cut, hides baby fat wonderfully.


Beautiful dress! Fits as expected.


Looks amazing!
