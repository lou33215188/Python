Perfect dress for a dinner date.


It's amazing! Super soft/silky (whatever you would call it)


I absolutely love the color!


It was slightly smaller in size, but I ordered a bit larger and it was perfect.  Beautiful.  Great color, great dress.  Happy.


The Dress is just what I was looking for..  Fit perfectly... Think of getting it in another color..


Perfect dress! Great price! Fit great! I bought a 3x .


I love it! Perfect fit. Bought it for a wedding.


Beautiful dress! It looks exactly like it is shown in the picture. Would definitely recommend it!


It wasn't for me.  I ordered an x-large and boy was it big - I usually wear a 12/14 - I could have used a medium.  Lace was way too sheer also.


It.was to small


Fits well, length as expected
