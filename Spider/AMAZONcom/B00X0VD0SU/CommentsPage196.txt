It is a pretty dress!!!


I was hesitant to purchase a dress online because I wasn't sure if it would fit or not, as well as unsure about the fabric & construction of it. I was pleasantly surprised when I the dress was soft, not cheap looking, & it fits beautifully! I love the extra length, which can easily be fixed. It's better to have excess fabric than not enough. The color of the fabric is spot on. The only issue is the zipper. It was a struggle to zip up the dress while wearing it. It would get stuck and not move even though it wasn't a tight fit. I will order again though. Even with the zipper issue I still love the dress. I'm going to be telling my bridesmaids that this is one of the dress options.


Fits like a glove!
