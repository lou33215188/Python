The dress is lovely. I would not return it but the only flaw is the cloth looks a bit cheap. Other than that the dress is perfect.


Well made and flattering piece.  Will look great as a bridesmaid dress.  Product arrived VERY quickly!  Great service, would recommend this product and seller again in a heartbeat.


It seemed smaller than the first smaller size I ordered. Just the bust size was too small.


I really like it thanku


Dress is good but long for me. So I think I won't enjoy wearing it.


Kinda cheap looking, good in the dark.


The dress is very pretty and the material is nice.  It is definitely worth the price!


Was good for the money


Very cheap material


Really comfortable and feels elegant. The lace in the back is very lovely and covers well. Perfect for a wedding!
