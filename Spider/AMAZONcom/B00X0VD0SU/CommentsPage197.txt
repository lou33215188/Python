Perfect! Received tons of complements all night!ğŸ’ƒ


Easy fast beautiful and lined for a chill. Love.


Great fit and nice material. Beautiful long casual dress with both a Bohemian and classy touch.


This dress is amazing. Great fit, color and feel. It was a tad long, but that was easily fixed.


The top portion doesn't fit as long as in the picture. So it's an empire waist.


Thanks!


Looks great


This item is okay.  The fabric is a little weak without much shape but the lace work is nice.


I like the material of the dress. â�¤ï¸�


Perfect dress for my best friend's wedding. Fits great and I'm a big girl.
