Beautiful dress.  BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT IT HAS TO BE IRONED.  I bought it to take on cruises, but I can't take an iron on the cruise ships.  So I will have to have them iron it for me,  Easy to wash, but doesn't come out of the dryer wrinklefree.


WOW WOW WOW!  If you have reservations about buying this dress, DON'T!  It is well made, very comfortable, very feminine and overall absolutely lovely!  I'm just getting into a size 16 after some weight loss and the XL fits me very well.


I adore this dress! Comfortable, quality lining. Buy this dress. Would love it in more colors. I wear a size 10 and ordered a large. I'm 5'10" and it was long enough I could wear heels. Great dress for dancing.


Well made. Arrived on time. The picture lead me to believe ther was some type of shimmer or sparkle at the top of the dress but there is not. Also the back is a sheer lace but the front is opaque. It is worth the money.


This was so comfortable


LOoks cheap.


Purchased for a choir concert. My daughter is a bit top and bottom heavy so we were not sure how it would work out. It was BEAUTIFUL on her. Fit in all the right places and hung where it needed to. The top was a bit see-through but it was easy enough to wear a black cami underneath. She didn't overheat and it gave her a very classic look.


Very disappointed in the lack of quality of this gown.


Beautiful dresses, I ordered 7 for my bridesmaids, all with different body types, and I had no complaints. They look great on everyone!!


Beautiful dress I love it.  I'm a size 16. It fits a little snug on the boobies but I can fix that. I'm going to purchase another color.
