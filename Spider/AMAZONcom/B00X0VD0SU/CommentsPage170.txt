Beautiful dress, perfect size, good quality.


This dress was well made. Was alittle worried being it was cheap but its awesome.


My daughter loved this dress! It's still one of her favorites after a year.


I love this dress. It fits perfect its very beautiful and flattering to many body shapes.


I wore this wonderful dress on my prom night, looked great and won prom queen! If anything, it was a bit long, but that's nothing that heels can't fix.


Was tasteful and elegant as described.


This dress is amazing, only issue is that it's too long a drags a bit but, I'm 5'1 so it could just be that I'm short.


Beautiful dress.  Exactly what I was looking for. :)


Not the right fit at all


Fit perfectly, and received so many compliments. LOVE!
