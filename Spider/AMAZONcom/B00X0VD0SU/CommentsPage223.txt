This was a little long but I expected that being I am short, also the dress is comfortable and I plan to order another in a different color


Way too big and because the bottom of the skirt was so heavy it pulled it all down even more. Had to return it.


TERRIBLE!!! Not even close to the same dress in the picture!


I purchased this dress for a wedding and waited to recently try on and it's the wrong size and it's too late to return it :(


Beautiful dress, used as my maternity picture dress. Recieved MANY compliments and no-one could believe the price I paid. Love it.
