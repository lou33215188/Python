I love this dress. I told all of my friends about it. It fits perfectly, the quality seems nice, and it's long enough! I bought this to wear to a wedding next month--I can't wait :)


Exactly the description, love the color,love the way it fit


Beautiful dress, looks very nice


I'm typically a size 12 and the 2XL fit like a glove!! The only problem is I'm 5'2 and had to alter the dress length (side note: I have to do that with every dress I buy).


I wore this to a Fall wedding and received several compliments. I'm 5'7", 135lbs and the small fit perfectly.


Beautiful dress.  Wore this to a wedding and it was a hit.


The dress is absolutely beautiful and the quality is amazing! Which makes it all the more heartbreaking when you realize that it runs terribly small...


Very flattering, flirty and fun! The lace top is a sweet touch and the length is nice as I'm fairly tall (5'8")


Awesome dress for the price!! The navy is a very dark blue but beautiful!


Gorgeous dress! Quality is amazing and it fits great!
