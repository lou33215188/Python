Beautiful and feminine dress!


Great dress for a great price!! Highly recommended


The dress is perfect and it fit me like a glove, it was a little long but I'm wearing high heels so with them it's perfect.


Very pretty. Love the fit and flow of the dress!


Fits as expected, is so comfy and soft, and the red is the prettiest color :) really happy with this dress!


Lovely - the pic does not do it justice. Can be dressed up or down.  I ordered 1 size larger than my usual size (plus size) and it was way too small. I was sad to send it back.


Loved it


The lace and the fabric have 2 different color. Fitting is awful


Very beautiful dresses,, I got the right size... was med..


My weight is 130 poun.. and my height is 5 "5  they just fit perfect... thank you!


Great dress! The top is slightly see through, but totally fixable for the price!
