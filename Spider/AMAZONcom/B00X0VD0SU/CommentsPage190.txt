Great color! Very comfy. Ample chest- just what a nursing mom needed.


BEAUTIFUL GOWN, VERY WELL MADE !!!


Estaba roto en los costados.


I loved this dress and I am waiting to see others..


Fit great.  Used for a Wedding.  Worked out great.


beautiful dress just was far too large for my daughter.


Way too small and the return policy is terrible


Im 7 months pregnant and order a XL and fit perfect. If you are tall it will be short for you. I guess its for short and medium people.


It is beautiful_ I ordered one size up so I do think it runs a little small


nothing that a little needle and thread couldn't tighten up.  :)  Still a beautiful dress.
