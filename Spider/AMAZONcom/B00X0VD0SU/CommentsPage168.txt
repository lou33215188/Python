Nice dress.  Waist is a little higher than desired and is unflattering if you have a full bust.


After ordering three other dresses, I struck gold with this one.  It's the PERFECT dress for busty women :)  I'm a size 12 but a 38G. About 200 lbs.  I ordered the XXL.  If I were smaller in the chest I could have absolutely fit in the XL.  I'm 5'5.5" and it hit right at the ground.  I'll be able to wear it with flats.  The lace doesn't look incredibly expensive but it is very soft.  For a wedding I really don't care to attend ( long story ) this is the perfect dress to look very nice without spending too much.


it was SO tiny. I ordered an XXL, it fit my sister who is a S/M. The actual dress was okay, but not even close to the correct size.


Awesome dress!


Got much better than what I had expected!


Color is little light but it also looks good!

Love the material and the stretch! My bridesmaids will look beautiful in these dresses!!


Dress is really beautiful, size was off but its always hard for me to get my size right.


Happy with this purchase.


Not quite a large fit but it will work for one of the other bridesmaids.  I reordered an xl.  Love the dress though.


Got this dress for my wife & she loved it, she got complimented many times.
