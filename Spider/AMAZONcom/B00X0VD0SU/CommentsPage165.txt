Got here quick and was way better than I expected! Comfortable and flattering!


Very nice dress! Cannot believe I only paid $30 for it. High quality for an outstanding price.


The dress is great, it fits perfectly. I got a large, because I have a bigger bust. Was a little long on me, but i figured it's better to be a bit longer than to have it shorter!


Perfect length for me with low heels.  Hangs beautifully, I feel great wearing it for inside functions.


great dress way too long but love it


It is a very nice dress but it's just to small on the top for me


very tight if you are heavy on the top, not made for big chests.


loved the dress but the style did not fit like it was suppose to


My bridesmaids LOVE it! It fits comfortably! Came quickly! Good quality!


Like it and fits well
