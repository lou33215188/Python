Gorgeous and look expensive!


way too long


Very light and comfortable dress. The neckline is sexy, without being too deep... The fabric on the skirt is flowy and it's a nice length. The lace is ok for the price, but it looks nicer when you wear it than when you feel it... To know if it will fit, you just need to measure your  bust, since the bottom part is loose. I am 38 DD so I ordered the 3xl and it fits fine, perhaps even a bit loose...


Great dress for the price. It's cute, comfortable and fits well. Glad I purchased this.


Looks like the picture. Fits as expected.


I had to return it because it was too small.


This dress is so beautiful. Fits perfectly and looks amazing.

I love this dress!!
