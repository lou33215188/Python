Love, love, love this dress! Needed it for a formal ball. The dress is gorgeous and the lace back is beautiful. It was everything I hoped it would be and the price made me fall in love with it that much more.


Gorgeous fabric! The lace and gauze are very good quality (especially considering the price).


Fits a little too big, but I think I made a mistake with my measurements. Anyways, Its completely fixable with a taylor.


Completely recommended!


Didn't buy it.


A little to young girlish for me.


I am 5'11" flat foot and I was apprehensive about buying this maxi as none that I have ever purchased at a mall have ever been long enough. This dress fits amazingly and it hits the floor! Thank you for thinking of the tall ladies like myself! I will be ordering another is a different color. Thanks again!


This dress looks good and fits great with room to move around.


It was way too long, and the material didn't fall nicely at the waist. Definitely for skinny girls....


The dress is gorgeous! I bought it because i needed a long dress that would look good underwater, but I'm also going to be doing various other photo shoots with it because it looks great in general.


I am always scared to by things online (chest C38 weighing around 19o) but this dress is amazing and I can't wait to wear it for my friend's wedding!!!


The dress is a little bit heavy and I feel it like dragged down. Since it covered the entire legs, I got too hot from sun set on beach wedding in September.
