Dress is a bit long, but that can be altered. I have size 36B cup so I was a little hesitant on how the top portion was going to fit, but it came out to be really nice! The material is pretty stretchy, which means it's going to fit nicely on all body types. The color is as pictured.


I ordered a little bigger in base of others reviews and oh Wow, its a beautiful and very elegant dress!! you can use it as foramal or casual or dependig of your ascesories.  Love ths dress!! good quality and material!!

I am a size 20 but this dress fit great.  I received a lot of compliments while I was wearing it.  It's long and has an elegant feel to it.


Dress is pretty its a little long and a bit large .


I was happily surprised. I am 5â€™4 230. It was a little long.


I was skeptical about ordering this dress because it was so reasonably priced but Im so glad I did. The dress fits very well and is so comfortable. Definitely worth it!


This is a very high-quality dress considering the price is so low. Was very surprised! I am 5'9" and weigh 125 and it is a little too large in a small, but still workable. Very pretty though and actually long enough even being 5"9".


Really pretty dress! Hoe ever i returned do to a zipper defect!


Gorgeous and elegant.  Totally recommended
