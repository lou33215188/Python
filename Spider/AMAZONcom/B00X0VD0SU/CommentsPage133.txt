Comfortable, stylish, and classy.  I received so many compliments on this dress and will certainly wear it for many events. The price point was amazing and was perfect for the event I attended with my husband.  Love, love, love this dress!!!!


I got this dress for my baby shower. The material is good quality and the dress was very comfortable.


NICE SIZE, ELECTRIC SO NO MORE BATTERIES! WORKED GREAT


I really like the dress it is really nice. The only thing I don't like is the zipper. Between the lace and waste the zipper gets stuck at this point I might not be able to wear it. Someone should check out the sewing in that spot.


Great value for the price. Went a size larger and should have stuck with my first choice for size. Wore to a formal wedding and it was quite nice.


I measured myself with the chart and the size came out to large BUT it is beautiful and so comfortable


Poor quality i dislike it


I love the color.


Adorable for the price


Really pretty! I am usually a small-medium and went with a medium because of the reviews. It looks beautiful on me, and very elegant.  It is too long on me, which is kinda expected (im 5''4) but you could wear it with really tall heels and be in the clear
