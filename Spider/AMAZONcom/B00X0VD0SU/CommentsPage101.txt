I love this dress! I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it on. It fits so well and is so comfy.


Georgeous dress! Used it for my pre-wedding photoshoot and received a lot of complements. I am 5.7 and 140lb and this size was perfect for me.


Beautiful. Neckline is not too low and waist is slightly higher than pictured so it is perfect for hiding some unwanted curves. The lace is stretchy which gives me enough room to play violin. This dress is going to be used for playing with a symphony group.


This dress fit beautifully. I measured before purchase and it fit exactly as described. The price was wonderful and I'm happy.


Elegant dress.


A wonderful buy. Very elegant dress. It as long as the floor unless you are in heels. I am 5' 8'' about 160lbs.


Its a pretty dress but not for my body type. I have a larger bust, so it was not very apealing on me.


comfortable and pretty!


This dress is absolutely gorgeous! Made beautiful and very comfortable!!!! Will be buying another one in a different color!


Fits perfect and very comfortable


Came as expected. On time
