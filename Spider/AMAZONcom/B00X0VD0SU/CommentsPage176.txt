Did not like it ,it looked like a nightgown  ;( :(


My daughter loves this dress so much that she having  it altered as a size extra-small was not offered as a choice.


I am absolutely in love with this beautiful dress


Fit great. Wore for a bridesmaid dress.


Wear an18w but only available in 22 figured I could take it in, barely fits.


Too large - but better quality then I expected for price!


I like this dress a lot, it is so cute!


Beautiful dress.


It's an awesome dress it fit looks great not cheaply made


Beautiful and so comfy!
