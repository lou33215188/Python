love it...miusol has one of the best dresses i ever seen.


It's a little bit long but I will say it's okay


Looks nicer than I thought it would for the price. I normally wear a 10 or 12 I ordered this in a 14.


The fit was great however my dress was cut differently then all of the other bridesmaids. One strap was 3/4 an inch smaller then the other strap.


This dress is a lovely deep green, is nice and long, and is very feminine and sexy on. For size accuracy, just be sure to follow the size chart. Quality is better than the price would suggest. I wear these dresses often and just dress them down for more casual outings, with a denim or moto jacket and more casual jewelry. This dress is a great alternative on a summer night as it is light and airy, but covers my legs against hungry mosquitos. Sometimes on Ever-Pretty dresses the lining is slippery and feels cheap. This lining is a great texture with a nice 'hand' and they didn't skimp on the amount of lining fabric. The dress has a very light, sexy, 'swishy' feel to it. I love wearing it. For the price I can purchase all three colors!


It is such a cute dress but it's very long.  it fit great everywhere else


I really like this dress, looks great on. Just a bit too long.


Beautiful color, fit, and appearance. Can't believe it was only $30!


Perfect dress for the occasion. Reasonable price, traveled well, and was very comfortable.


bridesmaid dress for my plus size diva sister, she looks great in it!
