Ordered for a wedding but I am normally between and 1x and 2 x and it was way too tight. It was a beautiful dress otherwise.


Loved this dress!! Wore it to my Sorority Formal, I loved the back, I felt pretty and felt confident.  I'm somewhat bigger so it was nice to feel confident.  It was a little too long however so I had to hem it.


Very simple yet elegant! Love the lace sleeves and back. Received lots of compliments on it, plus it was very comfortable! Awesome deal for a formal dress.


True to size


A little short for someone like me who is 6 ft. but otherwise great!


My wife was happy with it


I bought this dress as a last minute decision goes a murder/mystery birthday party my daughter was going to. It fit amazing and she was dressed perfectly.  The quality was far more than I expected. Nice purchase


The zipper was stuck the first time I tried it on but I fixed it and now fits perfect!


Fits great, perfect length. I ordered a Large and (im 5'4" and about 170lbs) I love it. Perfect for a masquerade costume party
