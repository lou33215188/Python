Looks like itâ€™s for a pregnant woman.


Loved the dress. Wore it in holiday party at office and got lots of compliments from everybody. Luckily I had matching footwear, which are perfect for this dress.


Love the dress. The material is nice and the back is beautiful. But it's to big :(. I ordered a small and I'm 5'7' 122 lb. and it just didn't fit. They don't make a xs either so I'm bummed. But I would recommend it if you think a small or up will fit. It was also very long which is great if you are taller and wearing heals :)


Bought as a bridesmaids dress. Loved it! Was very comfortable all day. Only only con about this dress is the length. I recommend it if you plan on wearing heels. I do see myself wearing this again


Fit as expected.


Arrived on time, beautiful. Back was see through so unable to wear a normal bra, received many compliments


Don't know if I got wrong one but small could fit two of me!


It fits nicely. The top is stretchable and reaches a little higher from the waist which makes it an all-size flattering fit. I'm 4,6" high and with high heels the length of the dress reaches to the floor. If you are shorter you might need to pick it up as you walk. I bought the navy and it is a deep rich color. Very nice.


Love the way it fits and even though it is a little longer than expected but now I can wear shoes that I might not otherwise have worn because they won't show.  Love how the dress drapes from the bust line.


This dress is a wonderful deal!! It fits great and does not look cheap at all! Very flattering and elegant. So happy with my purchase:)
