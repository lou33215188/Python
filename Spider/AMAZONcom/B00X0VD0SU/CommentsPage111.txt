Beautiful dress!  Thinking about getting it in a couple colors. Fits perfectly!


These are beautiful dresses, perfect bridesmaid dresses, and perfect for busty girls, covers them very well.


Im 5'5 and 163lbs, I purchased a medium and it fit great! I did not wear a bra but I did wear pasties


fit well, although a little long and worked well for a formal gala event


Pretty dress. 2 stars because I ordered a medium that is actually more like a US XL... lame.


I needed it for a recital. Didn't need a bra. Looks see through but there is fabric in the front, so you can have the lace show in the back. I wear a large t-shirt and the large fit perfect. I play cello and I can easily play in it.


Wore this in a wedding and it was by far the most comfortable bridesmaids dress I've ever been in I'm 25 weeks pregnant so it was perfect only thing I can say that's negative is the zipper is a little cheap


The size chart is incredibly accurate. The dress is amazing quality, really nice and comfortable. Amazingfir the price you pay! Could easily pass for an expensive dress. Going to be a bridesmaid dress for my sister-in-law to be.


Black tie event on a budget- perfect and looks like it cost a lot more than it did!


Great price,  beautiful dress!  Fits perfectly.
