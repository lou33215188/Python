I'm 240 lbs, 5'4'' and the 2x fit perfectly. :)


I liked the way it fit, but bride did not like it.


Fit is odd.  Very large in shoulders , tighter in midsection


Too small sending it back


I am in LOVE with this dress!!! I want to wear it everyday!


Very pretty and good quality.  Fit perfectly.


The dress was nice but size was a little off.


Love the dress, just a little tight on the bust. But other then that, fits good.


Not true to size


Not as pictured, cheap quality and cheaply made. Not worth 20 dollars. total waste
