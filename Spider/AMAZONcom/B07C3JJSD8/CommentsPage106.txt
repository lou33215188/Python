It is OK


I like it


Love this, wish I would have bought more colors. Goes great with my cowboy boots!


Comfortable and flattering.


Looks good fits well. But extremely see through. I got the light pink one.


The material


Cute dress!


Fits good.


Thin material. OK fit.


As long as you put a belt on your waistline, it fits Sp adorably and comfortably!!!  I'll be buying more in different colors
