It's ok


Soft, light weight and comfortable.


Nice material and size is acurate.


Comfy and cool. Perfect summer clothing.


Very comfortable and excellent pricing!


The dress fit just fine


Just what I was looking for.


Not a "Tee-shirt" dress. I was expecting a comfy casual slip-on tee-shirt, long enough to be a dress. This is 100% nylon fabric, very short swing type dress. I read the fabric content, but I was focused on tee-shirt, thinking- casual, cool and relaxing.


Actually, if you prefer the mini-dress length, it could be a dressy little swing type outfit.


I was not shopping  for that look. I expected and was shopping for a dress, as  described.


This is a 2-Star purchase because it is not as advertised.


On the other hand, it does wash on cold with about a 10% shrinkage in length.


Loved it - the color is beautiful


Colors are great and fits nice
