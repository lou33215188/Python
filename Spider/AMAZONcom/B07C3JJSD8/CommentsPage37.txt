This was a great fit other than it’s a bit shorter than I anticipated.  Will still work great for the summer.


I have worn this once and it was so soft, flexible and not confining. I am unable to wear tight fitting clothing. It is easy to wash and hang dry.


LOVE IT! I purchased a Large in fushia. I am 5’4” and about a size 8-10 and this dress’ fit is flattering! It hits about mid calf and it’s perfect for summer because of its lightweight fabric! I will be ordering more colors!


Love this dress!!! Im alittle heavy and 5'4. Bought an XL. Fit me perfect. Going to wear it with a jean jacket or light sweater maybe capris leggings or black shear tights. Maybe even with boots. Now I have a black dress to dress up or down. Only thing I don't care for is how it goes up on the sides..l... no big deal ... still love it!


So so so very soft and comfy! I'm glad I bought 2 and will be buying more before they disappear!


I should have known from the pic, but this is way too big and shapeless. Not cute.


I LOVE these shirts! They are so soft and super comfy! I have purchased multiple colors.


amazingly soft and very comfortable! not restricting. I teach and these are great with leggings and a cardigan!


I can't believe the quality of this dress for the price! I actually bought it as part of a Halloween costume but I wear it all the time with boots and a belt. I will be buying more in different colors!!


LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!! I'll be buying more. I'm very tan and this color looks amazing on me. The fit is snug but light weight. Flows great. Definitely breathable.
