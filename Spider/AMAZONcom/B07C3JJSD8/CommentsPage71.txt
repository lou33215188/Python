The purple is great and vibrant.  I wear it as a tunic over leggings and really enjoy it :)


Great fabric! Great Fit!  But the color was really blah compared to the computer screen color?  So I dyed it myself into a chocolate brown!


Very Comfy, fit well. Sleeves a bit short but that's ok.


Size did not fit as advertised.  Returned dress.


Color is right on and fit is great


Very comfortable


WAAAAAYYYYY too short, and is not flattering whatsoever


Very nice flowing fabric...I purchased one of every color!


Love it!!! Fits perfect, color is so prettier than I expected.


Very see through, looks cheap.
