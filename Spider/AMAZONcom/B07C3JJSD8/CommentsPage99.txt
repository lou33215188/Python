Great fit  and I’m 5’2 and it came just a little above my knee.


Too large


It's a super cute dress. A bit tighter than I expected, but it looks great over leggings and is pretty good quality for the price.


It is very comfortable and valuable.


Very comfy.


Great material just a little bit for what I thought it would be. Will still wear as a dress.


I wear this with leggings. Love it


Super comfortable and long enough to be a short dress or wear with leggings. About to order more colors!


Fit okay.  Had hoped the material would be heavier.  Pretty color


The only thing I don't like on these dresses is the uneven hem lines.  I hate that.  Wish they were level to the floor all the way around.
