Super soft. Super comfy. I'm short so it looks like a dress on me so I just paid it with some mean leggings and boots. Sets off a cute little look.


The dress is just as expected. It is made well and the material is not too heavy and more importantly not too light. I was afraid it might be too thin showing every bump but instead it was very flattering with easy flowing lines.


Very disappointed. Received this dress and it had very obvious discoloration along the top/chest. Will have to return.


I bought this dress to wear around the house in the hot summers of Arizona. It, of course, can be work anywhere. The fabric is fabulous, so soft and comfortable. I'm going to order more of them. It fit just perfect, just as I expected.


My wife loves this dress.  It fits as expected, is good value for the money and the color is great!  It says to hand wash but I washed in the machine.


Unfortunately I wanted to return it but didn't get around to it so I'm kinda stuck with it. It does make a nice winter length dress as long as I'm wearing leggings but its too short without (TX weather makes it ok that its short sleeve). I do love the color though.


Color is great - ordered blue is more of a periwinkle which I love..  As others have stated, it is very material is thin, would only wear around the house, with that being said I think that it runs small ,  I followed the size chart, I would have gone for the larger size.


However I have not worn the dress yet. Thus, I will not know finally until I've had the opportunity to observe it through all phases.


Love love love this dress. It is so cute and comfortable. I am 5'3" 130lb and the Medium fit perfectly. Very soft, I got many compliments when I wore it. Can be casual or dressy depending on your jewelry and shoes. I am going to purchase in other colors.


This is great I had some purple print leggings and needed a top. I like them long and this shirt/dress is long. Beautiful color.
