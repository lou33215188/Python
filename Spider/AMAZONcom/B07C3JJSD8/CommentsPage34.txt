Lightweight and comfy!


Fit great. Actually long enough to wear as a dress. Looks great with leggings though too. Nice bright orange color!


The tunic hugged every curve of my body and the fabric was much thinner than expected. It most definitely runs small.


Arrived as promised, looks great on me. It arrived a bit wrinkled, so I ran it through with my wash. It came out perfect.


I LOVE THE COLOR AND FIT. JUST TOO SHORT TO WEAR TO CHURCH. I AM KEEPING IT TO WEAR AS A NIGHTSHIRT.


It's a little bit thin, but still works fine. Probably best to wear during warmer months.


looks great  maybe just at little thin but ordered it to wear with leggings and under vest or kimono


Lovely color saturation, very soft fabric with a silky feel...fit is as expected.  I wear these with leggings...very comfortable. I'm petite, so this comes to knee length...which is perfect


I am usually a small and bought one in this dress. It’s a little big but I’d much rather it be a little big than too small! Great material for the price! Love it.


Love it.  Great for work or home.  Very comfy.
