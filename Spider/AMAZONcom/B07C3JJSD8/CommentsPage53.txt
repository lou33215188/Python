Comfortable.  Easy to wear.  Might buy more in other colors!


Cute and comfortable but very short. Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€� and this is mid thigh on me, which is too short to wear without leggings underneath.


I got this in a few different colors to pair with LuLaRoe leggings. It looks great and I was able to dress it up with some jewelry to be able to wear to my office for work. I received several compliments on it.


A Lot larger than I thought.  Also very thin material.


So frustrating that I received a VERY VERY VERY different dress than I was supposed to. It's not even clothes to looking like any of the options, it's long sleeve lace with some shifting see through material on the bottom. So frustrated right now.


It fits very well.


Comfortable with leggings. Sleeves are pretty tight.


Beautiful color, fits great!


I love these tops! Very flow and comfy! Will definitely buy more..ğŸ˜Š


Love this simple classic dress
