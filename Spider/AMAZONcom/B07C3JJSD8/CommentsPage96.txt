Runs small for anyone ordering.


Nice product but kinda small for the claimed size


Love the color and fits perfectly.


Love the fabric! Love the color! Love this dress! I sized up to make it more loose and flowing.


I am happy with the actual color of the shirt but it somewhat see through.  It is also a little longer than I would like.


Very happy with this! This dress runs slightly on the small size so order one size up. Nice material that is not too thin.


Very comfortable dress. It’s very soft. I will definitely buy another one. You can’t beat the price either.


Great material


Love these! I have three. Super comfortable and great colors for my leggings


Love this! Planning on ordering more colors, I ordered the red one and it looks super cute with my Harley Quinn leggings!
