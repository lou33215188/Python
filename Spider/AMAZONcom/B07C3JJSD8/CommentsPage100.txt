Way too long for my taste.  More like a dress than a tunic will return.


Perfect for warm spring days. Could be a little longer but I am happy with my purchase.


I ordered white, it's pretty good nice covered especially since I have a big butt and I'm short.


Love it


The fit was perfect. It looked good on me and is super comfortable.  I am ordering 2 more. ğŸ˜Š


My favorite shirt! I want one in every color!


Excellent dress! Thx


I loved the item and how it fit. The only thing i didnt like was the odd smell. It didnt smell bad but was odd.


Great buy!


Very comfortable, great color selection. A little slow on shipping but that was expected since I ordered a few days before christmas
