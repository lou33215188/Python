I love the material. It feels like a  cashmere t-shirt material but for me it runs small. I am a 3xl and that is what I ordered. I tried it on with out a shaper but will definitely wear one. The color is nice and the length is nice. It stop a little above my knees and I am 5â€™5.


Love the color, fits great, awesome price! I bought 5 different colors.


It's the most comfortable thing I've worn in my life so far.


I love this dress and I paired it with leggings I bought from Amazon.  Great color, material is comfortable and so easy to take care of.


Y'all. The fabric is sooo soft. Like those leggings. Its amaze balls. Its longer than i expected but i am 100% okay with that. You will love this.


It is very "unforgiving". The pink color is very pretty but almost see through. Only wear nude seamless undergarments. It looks cute accessorized (boots, scarf, jean jacket, etc.) but strange on a short, average build, woman on its own. I probably wouldn't buy this gain.


These are comfortable dresses but I listened to reviews and ordered a size smaller than usual, big mistake. I don't like clingy clothes and the smaller size clung too much. So for me, it would have been true to size.


These tops are beautiful and soft, but the material is problematic. Anything that spills on it leaves a stain, including water. I can't make it through a morning before this top looks disheveled.


This color was beautiful, and I loved it! I'm a true XL and found it a little bulky in the skirt. Ordering another one in the Lesser size.


This dress fits me just fine and is very comfortable. I love the deep gray color of the fabric. The quality is what I expected for the price I paid so I'm satisfied with my purchase.
