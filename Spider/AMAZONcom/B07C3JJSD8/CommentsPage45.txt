The size is one size larger than it should be labeled. I was NOT happy with the thickness, or rather how THIN, the material is. It feels nice and looks nice but th material is far too thin. I fear a finger will poke a hole!


received item early, and love how this item fits, it is comfortable and would recommend to others


Loved how it fit, got M for myself 5â€™6â€� 150lbs.


I thought this was going to be super cute but as soon as I put it on I notice these light spots on the front as well as a light line across the chest! Super bummed out! May have just happened during shipping or packaging but pretty bummed! Was wanting to wear this for the holidays! Oh well, I'll keep shopping!


This can't be worn as a dress as the fabric is way too thin. It's a nightgown at best.


The fabric is stretchy, which is nice, but it's pretty transparent. I need to wear a slip under this, which is too warm in Texas most of the year. It's cute for winter with a scarf, though.


Love the color and fit will be ordering more colors in the future. Great piece for Florida weather. I bet it would be awesome for a cruise or other summer vacation.


Love it! True to color and size. Great with or without leggings. Will be purchasing more colors!


Purchased 4 and very happy with the quality of the material.  Highly comfortable too!ğŸ˜Š


Love this dress. The fit is great.  Most likely to purchase another in a different color.
