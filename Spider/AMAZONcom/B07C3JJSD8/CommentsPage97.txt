Very comfortable, long length, nice to wear with leggings


Love!!!


I love the fit of this dress, and the color is better than expected. I bought it to wear to work and it did not disappoint. The length is perfect and falls right above my knee.


It felt super soft and looked like it would be comfortable but there was a hole on one of the seams


Loved it, fit perfect! ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


Arrived very wrinkled and not a clean white, looks dirty. And with no tags, it could have been worn and worn.


Very comfortable. Feels good on and like the movement without feeling like i am wearing a giant shirt. I am a size 16 and ordered 1xl. Fits perfect. Bought to wear with leggings !


I bought 3 off these because I love dresses lime this in the spring/summer. I'm so in love with them!!


Super comfy cotton. Only worn once but loved it so far. Will update one I see how well it washes.


Love the dress, fits perfect.
