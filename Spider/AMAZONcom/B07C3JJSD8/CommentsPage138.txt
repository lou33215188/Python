Comfy and a good length


Item arrived on time and fits well!


Great dress! Need a slip or good long sweater, easy to pair with anything you have!


I am very pleased with this dress, I'll be wearing it with leggings & boots.  The color is one of my favorites and the fabric is so soft, very comfortable.


I love this top. It is very soft and comfortable. It fits great and is very flattering. I want another one or two in different colors.


This is perfect and exactly what I wanted! The fit is great. It's a light, airy material. It is a little shorter than my Old Navy tee shirt dresses, but still covers everything. :) The color is great for Mizzou game days!


cute green dress! Somewhat longer in the back than the front, which is trendy! I like it, very comfy. It does smell like dye, but that's to be expected.


The material is kind of clingy so I would recommend ordering a bigger size than needed if you don't like clingy. I like that it is soft material, the color is beautiful, and the shipment was on time!


The color is beautiful and great fit. The hem is a little uneven. I don’t think it will be too noticeable with the hemline of today’s fashion.


Bought this as a dress. It is too sheer for me for that but is fantastic as a nightgown. Would buy more at that price in different colors. Love it.
