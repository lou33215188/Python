Love it. Material is a bit thin but still very comfy.


Received exactly what I expected - a light weight, tunic like dress.  I plan to wear with leggings.


Love this shirt! I went ahead and ordered the red wine. It fits like a lularoe Carley but fractions of the price! I wear an xl but I got a xxl after reading reviews and it fits good.


Very nice and comfortable


Satisfied with the product.

Nice and Flowy, not see through at all!


Soft and comfortable. Fits well.


This is a very nice and soft tunic... I love it and will definitely be ordering more colors
