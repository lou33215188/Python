I ordered one and I loved it so much I ordered five more washes great feels great great quality


Arrived in the time promised,  fits  well. The material is thinner than expected.


Odd fit. Color was good.


The bottom of the dress was sewn very poorly and unevenly, was very disappointed!


Great simple flowing black dress. Looks great with leggings.


Great fit, good length tonwear with or without leggings.


Nice item, but it was picked straight out the package.


It's not for everyone!


Very soft  comfy and work appropriate.


I love the color and the fit. It is perfect for summer
