My type of dress.  So comfy.  It is a lil big on me and the sleeves are too big too.


Great length to wear with leggings. Soft, stretchy fabric. Love the feel.


Not what I expected,but will keep.


I would like the material to be a little thicker.  dress drapes well, and is comfortable.


Pretty product but the 3X = XL


I've ordered several now. So soft and comfy!


the material is very comfortable, color as the picture, I like it


Great little dress! Going on a cruise next month and will pack this! Great fit!


Fits great, comfortable and love the material.


I love this dress! It's nice and cool for those hot summer days!
