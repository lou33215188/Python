This was perfect fit and shipped fast. Thanks.


I got the orange in 3x. The color is vibrant and it fits just right. Good length, hitting just above the knee (I'm 5'3"). The material isn't too thin. You can't see through it. I'm pleased. Cute Spring dress at a great price.


Love this dress ..I wear a 12 and I bought at Med per. Reading the reviews fits perfect


Was actually a better quality than I thought it would be. I love how soft it is.


Woowza! What a great deal! Comfy and cost effective will be purchasing more!


It fits but the material is to thin so every detail of the body shows.


This is a little thin and a little clingy, but looks cute on.


Purchased this item for my daughter. The fit was perfect and she loved it. She said "I love how this feels".
