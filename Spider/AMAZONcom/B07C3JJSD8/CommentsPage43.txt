Cute, light, perfect for summer.  Would purchase in multiple colors.


Very nice. Like the material, a little silky. Fits appropriate to size listed. A little shorter than I expected but it will work with tights.


Comfortable , easy care, packs well and looks good right out of the suitcase. Great buy.


came with a slight stain near the bottom but other than that great. im 5'9" and 145 lbs for reference and the medium fits perfectly.


Very comfortable, SOFT


cute little dress & you can't beat the price


Super cute, lightweight easy to move in. Would purchase again


I'll wear this around the house, I'm in my 60's and have gained a ton of weight mostly in my belly so it's hard for anything to fit but this does. If you're younger and slimmer you could wear it out. It's not real thin, length is good, so it's a bargain.


This is very soft and light.  I got it in another color too.


Material not the best.....not sure I'll wear out of the house!
