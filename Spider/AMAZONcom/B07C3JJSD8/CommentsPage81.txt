Very soft material. Loose and flowy in all the right places. Color is spot on. Is thin, so if modesty is a list I would recommend a slip or tank underneath.


Super comfortable


fabric is to thin better as an undershirt


Itâ€™s a little short in the back to wear alone, but itâ€™s perfect to wear over leggings. Soft material...  waiting to see how it holds up in the washer before I order any others.  Would prefer it with pockets


I love my dresses to fit a little big so it doesn't hug me! It fit just how I wanted. I'm short and have some meat on me so I ordered my typical shirt size, 2XL and it was just how I wanted. Will definitely purchase again.


Looove this dress. Super soft and comfortable. I bought 2. ğŸ˜Š


The feel and quality is great! Wish I would've ordered a small, the medium is just a bit loose. Will be buying in different colors.


too short for a Mom


the color is a little darker than I expected but ok will keep. I would like the black long sleeves or 3/4 sleeve with pockets same size. I can't figure out if you got my order yet. please check.


Nice fit and perfect color
