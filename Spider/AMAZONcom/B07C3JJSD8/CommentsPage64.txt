After reading previous reviews I ordered a medium.  When ordering shirts I get a large but in this dress I decided to go down a size.  It fit perfectly.  Very comfortable and flattering.


I sized up because I'm large up top. I'm about a size 16 and went with 2x just to make sure top wasn't too tight. SO COMFY!


was what I expected like it fine


Based on reviews I was expecting this dress to be on the large side. I went ahead and ordered my normal size to be safe, and while it is a little large, I love the fit! It's super soft and flowy! Plan on ordering another black one for work, and a couple colors ;)


Material too thin, showed every roll ....


Great quality tunic top!


Soft, comfortable and it hangs/fits just right!


Love them

Very cute and cuddly think I'll get one more
