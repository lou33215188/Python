Very pretty.  Not sure if I would wear it to work but I really love it and I am going to buy more colors.


Great price!  I washed before wearing and it fit perfectly.  It doesn't need to be ironed. I put it on  the clothesline, and it came out beautifully.


I love this. I wear it with leggings and usually a cardigan. It is very comfortable and flattering to a plus size figure. I always get lots of compliments when I wear it.


Seriously in love with this dress! I ordered this last minute to wear to my casual baby shower and it was perfect! I’m already a bigger girl, plus 24 weeks pregnant, so I was a little leery of buying a dress without being able to try it on first, but it turned out better than I could have ever expected. Super light, flowy, and extremely flattering. I already ordered 4 more colors! Pictured is the dress in white, size XL. I’m 5’6 and I usually wear XL and run around a size 16 for reference.


These are fairly long - I'll have to cut the hem to make it a blouse, it's long enough to be a dress


I had to send one back because of a discolored streak in the front but once I got one without a streak I love it :-) I like the weight of the fabric. So many things are super thin these days....this hangs well


Very thin material. Wrinkles horribly. But it’s a perfect color for spring and if I only dry it for a few minutes and hang it immediately, it’s fine for around the house.


I love this dress! The color is such a unique shade of blue. It is super soft too. Great find!


36" bust and i got a medium, as I usually do, and it fits well. The dress is super thin and a bit see-through, as I expected, so I wore a slip with it and it was perfect. I would definitely order again!


Too large and very boxy, not flattering at all, so unless you are trying to hide something, do not order this dress! The material was comfy, but on the thin side, and the yellow color looks dingy.
