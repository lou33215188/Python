Arrived in good condition.


My only complaint is that it is a very thin material. Otherwise as described.


I tried it on just after it was delivered. I loved it so much that I immediately ordered two more in different colors. I have a larger tummy and am 5'7". The 2x fits perfectly. I will pair them with leggings in the winter and wear without in the summer!


Great color, clear washing instructions


Great price


The top fit great & the color is vibrant & just like it shows online. I will order more from that brand. I received the package when they said I would get it & amazon kept me updated on the progress of my order.


Came very wrinkled, did not come out when washed, will have to try low iron


Very clingy and it smells offensive to me. Have it hanging the are out, so far, no improvement.


Nice fabric, perfect to wear with leggings!


comfy


Fits true to size. I ordered a size larger and didn’t need to but I don’t think it’s so big I can’t wear it. Length is long enough to be a dress but works perfect with leggings as well.
