I love this dress. Wore it to work the day after I received it and received tons of compliments on how nice it looked, what a great color and how it fit.


This dress is super cute and paired with leggings and boots along with a scarf, you have the perfect fall outfit! I love it so I bought 3. They fit great! The material is a little thin, but seems like it will hold up to the test of time. No complaints!


I wear a size 18/20 and the 2X fits perfectly! I am 5'4 and it reaches just above my knees. The material is so soft and light weight. The color was exactly as shown in the picture. It did have a weird odor, but it came out in the wash. I absolutely love it, and I will be ordering more!


I love this top. I am a true 3X and have a lot to hide. This top does just that. It is made of a spandex like material which is clingy but it flares out so it hides the fat that I need hidden.


Just received this a few days ago. I immediately washed it and wore it the next day. It washed well, and I hung it to dry. Very flowy and super comfy. It definitely compares to lularoe pieces I have as far a comfort. It is very soft and is made to hang nicely. Sizing guide is spot on. I prefer loose fitting, ordered accordingly, and got exactly what I wanted. I can't speak yet of durability, but I can definitely say I am satisfied and will be ordering more in other colors!


LOVE! Such a beautiful color and the length was perfect for me, which I was worried about. I am 5'7, 160lbs and a 34B. I ordered a meduim. The dress hits at a flattering mid thigh length and the back is a tad longer which is a miracle for me because I have a big booty that hikes up dresses! It is super comfortable and soft. Will buy in other colors!


Perfect! I wanted a relaxed t-shirt dress and this is exactly what I was looking for. I have a few Lularoe Carlyâ€™s and this dress is even better. The carly is a bit too long on me since Iâ€™m only 5â€™3 and this length is perfect just above the knee. Good non-cling fabric, not see-through. I went back and ordered 2 more! (For comparable reference, I wear XS in Carly and typically wear size 4/6 in general, size small in this dress fits great)


My wife is a 36D/DD with a 34 waist top fit well a bit large at waist but worn with a belt she looks fantastic  material is a bit thin in white kinda see through lol but nice will buy darker colors next time/ very nice when wetğŸ˜‡ğŸ˜�


Very cool and comfy.  My daughter gave me "permission" to wear it to church or out in general.  I think I will order a couple more.  Good length.... not mini skirt - not maxi skirt.  Hits me just above my knee.


Absolutely love this dress. The material is super soft, it falls right above my knee. Can. E dressed up or down. I am 5'7 180. I got a L and it fits perfect. This will definitely be my go to summer dress!
