Perfect for my Bob’s Burgers Louise cosplay! Would buy again if needed


The color is a bit lighter than the picture, but the fabric is so soft! The length is perfect for me (I’m 5’2, and it hits right above the knee).  I love that it’s not see through!


I read the reviews and got a size larger because I am top heavy. It fits perfect. I love the material, it’s not clingy, and it’s so soft. I am going to order more in different colors.


I wore the dress with sandals. Dressed it up a bit by adding fashion jewelry. Very comfortable. Light weight. Loved the feel against my skin; VERY SOFT.


Great fit, super cute swing style.  Seems to be a good value.


So comfortable! Will work great with leggins!


Others have said that you need to go a size up, but I didn't experience this. I normally wear a large and this fit properly for me.


Comfortable, so cute with boots/rich color!


Cute.  Washes well.


Love this dress!!  Super comfortable and cute
