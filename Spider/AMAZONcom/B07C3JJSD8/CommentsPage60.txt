Looks shabby after first washing.  It is more of an around the house or after shower dress than a dress to wear in public.


Very comfortable excellent fit


Fits perfectly, super comfy, soft and is perfect to wear with leggings! I am 5'4" and this hits me right at my knees which is perfect! Cant wait to order more colors!


This material is very soft and stretchy. Very comfortable. The fit is bigger than anticipated, but will work if tied at the side like a large flowing shirt over leggings. The color is very bright and eye catching. Happy with the purchase for the most part.


Loved this!! I even ordered 3 more! Its so comfortable


snug fit.  I like something a little looser and a little longer but I took it to the tropics and only wore it in the house and patio area


Usually wear a Small size 6, this small is a little big, but very comfortable dress


Material is thin (see through)


Runs very large could have gone down 1 possibly 2 sizes. Not worth hassle to return I will keep it as a swimsuit cover up


Extremely comfortable, cute and fit true to size. Would recommend!! (:


Fits nicely and very comfortable
