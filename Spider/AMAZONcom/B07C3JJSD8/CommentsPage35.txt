It fits as I would expect. It is a soft tshirt fabric, very comfortable. Will buy in other colors now.


I love the color and the looseness. The only thing I hated is that it wasn't quite long enough in back. The front seems longer than the back and no I am not wearing it backwards. Perfect for a day out shopping ifit is not windy.


This dress is a little short for my liking, but it works perfectly with a pair of leggings! The fabric is incredibly soft and durable.


These are beautiful,  super soft and look great. However they are longer than expected. I'm 5'3 so these are more like a mini dress on me then a tunic,  maybe if I sized down? Not sure but other than being longer than expected im very pleased. And such a great deal.


Love the shirt style and length. The fabric is really soft, but it is extremely thin. When I put it on, there was no hiding what was underneath. If you donâ€™t mind your bra shining through, then itâ€™s great, but I prefer not to show it off in public. I gave this a 3 because I think I can make it work with a tank top on under it with leggings. ğŸ™‚


I have not yet worn it, but I have tried it on, and I really like it.  It runs small (I wear x-largr normally) but I ordered a 2x and it fits nicely and hangs very nicely as well.


After reading the reviews I went true to size and the fit was what I wanted. I'm 5'5 and long of torso and the dress hits me right above the knee. It is light weight and I have no issues with undergarments showing through.


It's thin material, I'll have to wear a slip under the white color. It's a long dress and I ordered it thinking it would look cute with leggings, but now I'm saving it for a summer time dress.


Runs a little small, I jumped up a size when ordering. Very light weight material that shows any bumps that you have


Love this dress. Had been looking for this color for quite a while. Fit is perfect and so comfortable. Thank you for your wonderful product
