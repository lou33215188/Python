This was surprisingly cute! It was a little big. I’m 5’ 6” and about 170 lbs and I got the XL. I probably could have ordered a large.


Very soft material but the Mellon color is a little see through


If you order an XL they will send a 1X but it fits just like an XL. I’m 5’6” 220lbs and it fits me great with room so it’s not clingy! I love this dress!


Super comfy!! Love!!


I love this ! Fits great!


Love this dress. The fabric is very soft. It's seems to be true sizing. It will look great when dressing it up with a belt or your favorite cardigan.


She loves it!


Fabric not of quality material. Too thin and it wears like a cheap ti-shirt.


Love it simple and comfy.  Ordered more colors


Great fit and color. Awesome dtess
