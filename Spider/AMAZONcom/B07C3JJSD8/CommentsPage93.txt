Fabric is very thin and lightweight.  Sleeves are somewhat short.


I love these tops, they are so comfy and fit nicely. You can wear them to dress up or to lounge in, they are great.


Love the quality


Loved this dress. The dress was a tad bit see through. But I wore a slip under and it looked just fine. Super comfy. I will definitely be buying one in every color.


Very cute dress! Not clingy and fits comfortably well. Would definitely buy again!


I am not happy with the green dress, it does not look like the color on the computer, if possible would like to return the green dress, fit is not good,


too small for me.


Great little dress, liked it so much I ordered two more!


Very happy with my purchase


The color was not what I expected. I wanted a vibrant royal blue like the picture, but the color was more dull/faded/muted

Ordered 2.  Couldn't be more happy with them.
