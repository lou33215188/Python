The quality for the price exceeded my expectations.  I ordered another, and may even order more.


disappointed in the quality of the material, the color is faded along the seam lines on the shoulder and sleeves. probably just wear it around the house, wouldn't wear it out anywhere.


Ordered in every color!


Color is true to the picture.  Haven't worn yet but think I'm going to live it.


Great price. Shirt is a bit more narrow than expected.


Good length, light weight and very comfortable! Plus I ordered small and it fit perfectly ğŸ˜Š


Loved the fit, color and price.  Very comfortable and would recommend it.  Will buy more in other colors.


Comfy dress, but would like it a little longer.


Love this dress! Comfortable and very flattering.


Nice
