These fit great. Perfect little swing tee shirt dress for everyday wear. You can dress it up or down. Looks great with flip flops or dressy sandals..


A little too tight for my tastes. Probably should have ordered the next size up. But overall it is cute and looks like it would be comfortable. And I might shorten the dress and turn it into a baby doll style shirt.


Fit pretty good got a large not too clingy but kind of thin.


I love these little dresses great for all types of weather they can be dressed up or down great fit very versatile and very flattering will be wearing these a lot


Great dress for the price. I got it as a swimsuit cover up but would wear it as intended for sure. Very soft and comfortable.


The fit is perfect for me. I love the soft fabric and the colors are fabulous. I bought the orange and it's a nice bright orange for fall. Perfect layered with a long sleeve top underneath and a pretty scarf


Comfortable and soft feeling.


Really nice and comfortable .


My dress arrived in good condition within the time slot given. The fabric is super soft!  It was a little shorter than I had anticipated, but overall met all my expectations.


Comfortable but a little too large. It's also somewhat sheer. The material is thin enough to show the details of a bra, so wear an undershirt that evens out bumps.
