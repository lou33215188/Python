Love it


I like the dress. It's pretty much what I wanted except slightly large. I used to always need a small,  but lately smalls have been tight in the arms so I ordered medium. I probably could have worn small.


Too clingy; showed everything.  I was looking for something which didn't hug the body so much.


The material is light and very comfy.


it was the color I wanted  and felt great on


To clingy for my taste


The dress is really nice and fits perfectly.


Arrived exactly when it was supposed to arrive. It was exactly as advertised. Love the color and material. It fits and feels great. Would buy from this retailer again.


I ordered it a size larger and it fits like I want. Thank you


Light weight perfect for casual or work, add leggings and boots and wear into fall!  Very happy!
