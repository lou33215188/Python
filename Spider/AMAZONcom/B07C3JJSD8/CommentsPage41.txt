I ordered 2 and will order more! They run big so order a smaller size.


I am so pleased that this garment fits true to size and is very comfortable.  Great for travel too.


Love These dresses. I ordered 5. They fit well are light (not see through) and comfy. My only issue is the length. At 5'3"  they are too long to look great with leggings and make my legs look even shorter. But they don't shrink in the dryer. Yay!?. Lol over all I love them.


its longer than I expected. someone shorter could wear it as a dress. But I do like it


The material feels great. The fit is perfect. Yes, I did order one size larger to make sure, and that was the perfect size. It looks like shown in the picture, and is very comfortable.


The fit was fine.  I like the style. l felt the feel of the fabric was a little thin.


Though it seems to run just a little small it was super cute and felt like it was good quality.


Extremely comfortable dress.  I like the stretchy material.  Looks good over leggings.


Don't waste time and money.  This had two holes in it and no package damage, very thin material.


I decided to use this as a nightgown it is so comfy
