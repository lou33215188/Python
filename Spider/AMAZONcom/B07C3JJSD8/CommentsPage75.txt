It was a soft dress but it was a little tighter than I expected.


love it.. i have in many colors


Looks Good, Feels Great .....Pricing and Material Awesome....


Love this


I love the feel of the dress and the way it swings. I thought it would be a little longer. I am 59 and it was a little bit shorter than what I was thinking it would be. Iâ€™m going to keep it and wear it as a top. Love your products.


Just what I expected.


Thin material wasn't as heavy as a T-shirt, which is what I expected. But it is very nice summer wear.


Love the dress, fit, it really exceeded my expectations for nice quality.


cute dress; true to size.....I'm 5'2" and hits just above the knee.


Love this, planning on getting one of every color!
