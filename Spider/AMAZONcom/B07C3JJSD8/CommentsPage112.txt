This a beautiful dress, I wore it yesterday, it for perfect the material is soft. I am very pleased.


Great to dress up or down. Will wear with leggings. Comfortable and true to size.


I bought it in 4 colors---fits and looks great---perfect on hot days


It did everything it was supposed to.  Got a lot of compliments.


Fits but it's completely see through. I will be using it for pajamas instead.


Material is amazing. The fit was a bit too large for my wife.


The fabric is so comfortable and easy to care for.


I lover the style and fabric but it runs about a size too small.


It was exactly what the picture shows :)


very nice easy to wear
