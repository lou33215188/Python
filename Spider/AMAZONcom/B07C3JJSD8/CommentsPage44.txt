I like the fit, but I am only 5 feet tall and actually fits me like a dress instead of a tunic.


Very comfortable. Maybe a little short. Will probably become a night pull over.


Love it. Looks good on and is very comfortable.


Nice utility dress. Good for travel. Pretty thin fabric. Clings.


Does not run true to size.  Runs a little small.


Very comfortable and like the long length.


Great dress, wish it had pockets though.


Super cute and I loved the color! But my issue was the bust (36DDD) line was too small.


I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and fit! I got a 1X just to be safe even though I'm usually an XL. It fit amazing! I love them for a quick outfit for college and I can't wait to pair them with tights when/if it gets cold in Florida! ;)


The color was a little faded but other than that I love it it's purple!!!!!!
