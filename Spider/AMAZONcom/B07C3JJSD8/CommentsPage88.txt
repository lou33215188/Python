This dress is fantastic!! Fits as expected, I am 5'2" 170lbs and got a large. Very versatile for dress up or casual.


Soft, comfortable material. My issue was finding a tee-tunic dress that was long enough! I'm 5' 10" and I can wear this to work and it's not too short!


Perfect little Spring/Summer dress.  You can dress it up or just wear with sandals or little white tennis shoe.  Love the feel the fabric.  The colors are gorgeous.


Very nice tunic. Soft material and looks great.


Got this for my lovely lady.  She loves it.


I like this dress and will probably order in additional colors.  It's comfy and made of quality material (not see thru).  The color (dark green) was lighter than expected but it wasn't a big deal.


Absolutely the most comfortable dress I've ever owned. Also held its shape and length after a wash and dry. Runs a little big - keep this in mind when ordering!


The material is soft, and the fit is true to size.


Love the color!  Size was great and it washed nicely.  Will totally order another color.


This was the largest size at the sale price. I love the dress, color, style, feel of material. Hopefully the material will stretch enough that I can wear it comfortably. Carvell Carter
