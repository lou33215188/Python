I love this dress. I love the material and the fit. Looks great over leggings.


Dress fit well and the 'swing' is flattering for a heavier set woman.


A pretty dress but my girlâ€™s shape means she is hard to fit and it looks best on someone with a less-prominent rear end and tummy.


I'm wearing this with leggings and it's the perfect fit. I have a long waist, 5'9 190 lbs. I got the 2xl hoping the length would be right...and it is!


Light weight fabric perfect for warm climates


It is very long for me - goes to my knees.


Super soft and comfy


I love my dresses perfect summer wear


I love this top! I'm a 22 in tops usually so I bought a 3x.  Perfect fit.  Not see through.  I'm 5'3 and it hits me mid thigh.  I'll be buying more.


I actually brought the dress for my mother in-law. When I saw I said they sent you a thin T-shirt but once she put it on it was beautiful.
