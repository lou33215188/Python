Don't order the ivory dress!!! It's see-through. I was hoping to wear it with black leggings in fall/winter and by itself in summer - nope. Can see the leggings through the dress. So disappointed. As for the fit and feel of the dress- it was amazing! Super soft, super comfy, and perfect fit. I'm 5'4, 150 lb, hourglass shape and ordered a medium. I'm going to order another dress in a different color, hopefully that one isn't see-through.


Lightweight, fits true to size.  Hem is sort of a clam shell shape -- rounded, longer in the back and front, shorter on the sides.  I wear it as a tunic over leggings.  Very comfortable.  Great price.  I will probably get more in different colors.


It is a beautiful color, soft fabric, and good fit. The only thing that surprised me was how thin the fabric is. I have not had a chance to clean it yet so I don't know how well it will wear.


I really love these tops. They are great to wear with leggings.  I love the material.  I will purchase more of these.  The price is great.


Ridiculously crooked hemline and very see through in white.


I really like this tunic. The small is too short to wear as a dress on its own (for me- I’m 5’6”) but is perfect over leggings or even shorts. Was a pretty loose fit when I first tried it on but after a wash it fit better. It is as described, “comfy”. Would buy again in others colors.


I love it but it is a bit on the thin side ..it is very comfortable


Completely happy with this T-Dress.  I'd wear it outside, if that was my intent - but I wanted it for a night shirt because it keeps cool.  Easy wash, hang to dry, what is not to like?  Excellent for travel and can wash by hand in cold water.


If you have a bit of a tummy i'd order a size up. Lovely color.


Received quickly. Very comfortable and stylish. Can dress it  up or wear as it comes.
