It seems very comfy, I machine washed and dried it hoping it would shrink because it fit more like a large than a medium


Nice casual dress. She likes it to wear out on a hot day where jeans or pants are inappropriate.  A real good buy


I love this for comfy wear at home. I donâ€™t feel sloppy in it, more elegant than a regular t shirt and sweats. I put it over leggings in the winter.


Thin fabric will be lovely in the summer too I think.


Very short. I could not wear as a dress. Makes a nice night gown.


For the price, this dress is well worth it, and I plan on ordering in other colors. For reference, Iâ€™m 5â€™11 and wear a size 14 and the dress hits about 3-4 inches above my knees. I ordered an x-large, which came as a 1x, so fits a bit large for me. Iâ€™ll peobably order the others in a large instead. Word of caution, the beige color is VERY see through!


Amazingly soft! I'm 5"10 and sometimes tunics are too short for me.  This one hangs to right above my knee! Just like I wantedğŸ‘�


Wonderfully 'swingey' and light - it drapes beautifully and I look forward to wearing it on many an occasion!


These dresses are so soft and comfortable. I bought almost one in each color because they can be dressed up or down.


Such a comfortable shirt dress that can be dresses up or down. I wear mine with leggings and add a necklace and change out shoes/boots to dress up. I'm 5"7 145 pounds and small chest. I usually wear a small or medium. Ordered a small and fits perfect. This style is very forgiving in the tummy area. I can now even where it during pregnancy too.


Very soft, well fitting on the top, just a bit of shrink in the wash. Iâ€™m 5â€™10â€� and XXL is too short to be a dress. Sadly, I think 5â€™7â€� may be the max height for this to still be a dress.
