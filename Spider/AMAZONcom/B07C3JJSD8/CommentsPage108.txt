So comfy


Shipped quickly and for a little small


The hems could be neater but it's a very stylish, well fitting dress


The tunic fit as expected however, the quality of the material was flimsy and thin.  I am not sure how well the fabric will launder.


True to size.  Flowy  Kind of thin so I wore Cami underneath


very comfortable and flows nice.


Quality good construction good


Love this dress.  Very well made & very comfy.


Fit right and ship fast ! Love the dress!!
