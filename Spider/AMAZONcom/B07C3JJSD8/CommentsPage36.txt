This is the perfect casual dress.  It fits very well, is figure flattering and just the right length.  You nailed it Belaroi - thanks!


I was looking for tops for leggings, these are perfect for covering both back and front! They are very stretchy, so at a normal size 20 on top, there is still give in the xxl!


I am very happy with this dress. It fits great and I love the color. Very comfortable. I bought 2 more in other colors and they are just as nice. They also washed up nice. Hung it up to dry.


The items arrived as expected, nicely packaged. I love the fabric as it is soft and feels good. They fit well and very simply cute. Thanks


Ordered size L. Height 5'9" Weight 182 lbs Bust 40C.  Fits great. Love the fitted bust. The light colors will show the bra lines if not smooth. Recommend a t-shirt bra. Length a few inches above my knees. Material is so soft. Love the look.  Just reordered again in 3 different colors.


I'm 5'5 and it's shorter than expected. A bit thinner fabric but looks good with my leggings.


The dress is very thin material and easy to see through. I don’t feel comfortable wearing it without a long sweater. It also is shorter on the sides. If I had realized the hem was in a U shake I would have gone up a size. It’s a bit too short on the sides for me to comfortably wear without leggings.


Good color, soft fabric, fits as expected.  I would love more in different colors!


I love wearing this at home! I only think it’s a bit expensive otherwise I would buy every color of it.


I bought the dress to wear in a costume half marathon. I needed a short Princess Leia dress and this worked perfectly when I put a belt on it. A note to people buying the white is that it is a little sheer. It was very comfortable.
