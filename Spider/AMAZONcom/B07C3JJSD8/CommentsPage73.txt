Will buy more


Hope the color doesn't fade when washed. REALLY comfy and cute. Looks great with leggings!


Great fit & great quality


Cute lightweight comfy fabric. Is super cute with leggings.


Wrinkles a bit more than I'd like. Went on bust size and ordered a large. I should have ordered a medium...


Cute, love the fabric but runs small


I love this shirt! It is long and flowing, just the way I was hoping for!


I got this as part of a costume and I donâ€™t think I would wear it normally. It is soft and a nice color but it is big. If they had a smaller size I would have gotten it.


Comfyyyyyy. Love this dress. Exactly what I wanted.


I bought this for a beach cover up and it's perfect.  I wear a size 12-14 in dresses/tops and this fits perfectly and makes a perfect beach cover up!
