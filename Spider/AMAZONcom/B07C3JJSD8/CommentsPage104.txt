Fabric was too transparent for anything other than gym ware.


Swing tunic is very comfortable, hangs beautifully on a curvy figure, and great color.


Loved everything about the dress!


The size is too big for S size


Dress fits perfectly.  The order was received on time and the erase of ordering was great.  Thank you...


I purchased six (6) in different colors.  Love them!  Wear with and without leggings.


Thicker fabric than others I've ordered from other companies.  I'm happy with it.


This dress is so soft, comfortable, and well proportioned. It was plenty long on me, and I'm almost 6 ft.


Loved the color and the way it fit!! Wish I would have bought two more during the special!!


I received the wrong product :/
