Comfy, loose, and nice fit. Khaki is NOT true to color. Was hoping for the light color pictured, ended up being several shade darker. It was supposed to be for a costume, so I’m pretty put off by it. I wish it were longer too.


Love this dress!!! Fits perfect


soft material,but very thin and simply made.  Seems to have a few spots in front where it may have been exposed to heat as it appears shiny.


super soft, comfy and washes well.


It was completely see through. The fit was cute though.


Very disappointed returned.


Very cute on and comfortable.


So soft and comfortable, just wish it had pockets


Item was as expected and is the correct size.


I’m 5’1 (170 lbs), large chested (38 G) I bought a large and it fits perfect. Fits perfect across the chest and doesn’t cling to stomach. Hits above the knee. I’m excited to have it in the summer for over my bathing suits. I’ve worn it several times since I got it a week ago! New fav!!
