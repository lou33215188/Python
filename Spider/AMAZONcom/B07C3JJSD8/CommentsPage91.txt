I really like this dress and so glad I purchased it.  It is very comfortable and am considering purchasing another color.


Fits great


Super comfortable although I think I would have gotten a size smaller it's got plenty of room. I'm going to get a clip for the back... which I think will look cute too!!


This shirt is soft & comfortable. It is a bit clingy, but looks nice when worn with leggings.


Picture shows a pleated shirt/dress - that is not what i received. It's basically a long t-shirt that is very thin. Not one pleat at all. It looks nothing like what is pictured.


I like the flow and feel of rh fabric, however it is a bit snug at the hips. Will go up a size on my next order.


Love my new dress, thank u!


LOVE these tops!!! So comfy and flowy! You can put a belt around them, tie them on the bottom corner, etc.  So versatile!


I like the leggings. But the shirts and dresses do not look the same as the picture. My bust is 43. So I went by the cart. To big.


Very comfortable and cute. I can dress it up or down - looks great with a cardigan and leggings!
