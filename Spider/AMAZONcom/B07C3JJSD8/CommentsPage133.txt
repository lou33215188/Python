it is so comfy.  I was not sure how size would fit so I ordered a blue one in a large the same time as this.  Wish I had ordered the


blue in medium.  The price was great also, now they cost more.  I am very happy with this tunic, hopefully they go back on today's deal


specia,l because then I will order one more in size medium.


good deal

After reading other reviews i decided to order a large and an extra large.  Just to be on the safe side.  The large fits great!  Fitted around the bust and flowing from there to the knees.  Im only 5'4" therefore the dress hits just above the knees in the front and back.  The sides are shorter but not much.  The dress has a nice scallop to it.  Making it vey  flowy (if that's  a word)I will be sending back the other one or just take it in on the sides.  The material is a little on the thin side, so i wouldn't recommend wearing without a slip.  I plan to wear mine with leggings.


Beautiful bright and vibrant colors, great fit I am 5'1"150 lbs perfect length for me I wear as a dress. Versatile I can wear alone if warm weather or if cooler with a denim jacket, a a blanket scarf or a sweater. The reason I gave 4 stars is due to the thinner material used, I would have preferred a material with a little more weight/ thickness. Nevertheless a great style!
