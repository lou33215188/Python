Softness but not a true 3x fit. Little to snug through stomach area. I am in wheelchair so sitting no one will really know. It would be more comfortable if a little more roomy.


Perfectly! An excellent shape and fit for my body. The green color is as shown in pictures and is awesome.


Confy and soft


A little longer than expected! I'm 5'3", and I'm getting the dress hemmed for my Halloween costume.  It was down to just past my knees. I want it to be mid-thigh.  Also, I ordered a Small.  Sometimes I order a Medium but this runs a little large.


This item is so see-through I may as well not wear anything.


We got these for a singing group. It is a little larger than expected, but hangs nicely. It needs more ironing than I expected. The price was right.


I like it very much


This company makes the most comfortable dresses!! They fit true to size and are stretchy. I've purchased 4 already!


No pleating just hangs not happy with product will return both


Love it!
