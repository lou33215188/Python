very poor quality fabric. Too thin for wearing in public and hem is extremely uneven.


Soft material, helds up after washing. Must hang up to dry.


Have this tyle in other colors, good for layering, etc, easy care.


I love this dress! I wear it with leggings. It would be to short if I didn't wear leggings with it. But it looks adorable paired with a sweater on top and some cute jewels. I would re biy in other colors for sure.


Very soft material but it runs large I purchased a medium and its big on me and i normally wear a large


Love it! Comfy! Flattering! Fits great! Orred one for my Daughter for an easy travel dress


Material thin and cheap  .  I could only wear it to bed, not out in public


I love this top so much I am ordering it in more colors.  It's perfect with capris and pants.


It's a little bigger than expected but I still really like it


Nice comfortable every day dress.  Needs a little dressing up with jewelry or bolero type jacket.
