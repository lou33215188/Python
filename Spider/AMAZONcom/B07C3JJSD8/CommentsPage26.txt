The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 5 is because it's way too short to be worn as a dress. I'm a size 20/22, so I ordered a 2XL. It fits great in the bust, sleeves, and tummy, but it stops about 4 inches above the knee. That being said, this is a perfect tunic to be worn over leggings. It's lightweight, flowy, and not clingy at all. Unfortunately, I ordered this to prepare for summer in the South, and leggings are a no-go past 70 degrees for me...


I love this dress, its so comfortable and light. I bought multiple colors so i could wear them to work.


Loved it so much, I bought 3 more in different colors! Very flattering!!


I washed it and took it out of the dryer damp. Very little wrinkling. It fits great and it is such a beautiful color. Flows naturally and feels wonderful. I might have to buy another one.


Love it! Definitely for warmer weather due to thinner fabric. Very comfortable! Fabric nice and stretchy without losing its shape. Nice bright color. I am 5'6" and it is above the knee a little short for my age. So I put Capri leggings and sandals with it, and it makes it age appropriate and a wonderful summer outfit!


Tried it- wow! Love it and ordered 2 more !!!!!  Not only are they very comfortable, but the flow of the dress camouflages all my


'humps & bumps' - so flattering.


brought this for my mom and she loves the way it looks and fit her body


Soft flowing dress.  Comfortable....slightly tighter in bust, but stretchy.


Very good quality and very soft comfortable material.  It's a little unforgiving with showing body lumps and rolls, though.


This dress is wonderfully comfortable I'm going to buy one more in a large to see if it's a little better than the extra large. When I decide which one I think is better I'm probably going to order 6 more these are awesome dresses.
