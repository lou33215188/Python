Very comfortable just wish it was a little shorter I’m 5’2” and was a little long for my taste but I’ll still wear it. Great dress would definitely recommend!!!


Very thin, poor quality


Material is thin, but hangs heavy. How long it holds up will tell in time.


I absolutely love this dress! It's very figure flattering and super comfortable ... what more can you ask for! I will definitely be ordering more in other colors!


It is slightly see through but it is great! It's super flowy and it's a cute color.


Very nice for the price!


Comfy, think I need another one.


Just a little too clingy on my lumpy body.  Not the dress fault. :)


I am very satisfied with these shirts. Very soft and very comfortable..


Very soft. Ordering one for my daughter
