Cute, very simple.  Can be dressed up with a scarf and/or jewelry and heels or dressed down with sandals.  The color is very vivid.  Great purchase for the money.  Have not wash yet so cannot speak to that.


Pretty color, soft material but very thin.


Perfect for work! Really cute and the appropriate length.


Thin material, but overall a nice shirt.


Color was exactly what I wanted! Great fit with leggings and boots or sandals.


Cute and comfortable.  Hang after washing.  I wouldn't suggest the dryer.


Fits as expected. Beautiful color. Will order more


Material very thin


Comfy and easy to wear. Fabric is kind of thin, but I don't feel like I have to wear a slip under it.


The dress has to be hand washed and hung up, which means it looks wrinkled and who has time to hand wash clothes.
