Fits as expected, perfect for summer or layering, comfortable and soft, and a great price for the quality. I will wash on cool and line dry. Bought several colors and they are all the same as pictured!


I loved the color, fabric and style I do wish it was a few inches longer. I am 5'6" and it is to short to wear alone but it works just fine as a tunic with leggings. I ordered a large and it is about an inch larger across the chest than my small lularoe


The color is very, very different from the picture. It's also very large. I'm 5'1 and a size 8/10, and the small was way too large on me.


I LOVE this dress!!! I want one in 10 more colors because it has to be one of the most comfortable things Iâ€™ve ever worn. I could live in it for the rest of my life!!


Fits just right, cute, and comfortable.


Love these dresses...so comfy!  I'm 5'2, 165 lb, xxl fits just the way I want it to!  Length is perfect for me (older lady), knee length.


It fit my wife like a tent. Wrinkled and not pleated like the picture


Fits perfectly, very soft and silky. Love love love I bought more in different colors


It fits! I love the color and it is sinfully soft


Very comfortable
