The dress looked nice to me (a man) when my wife put it on.... but then she explained to me why it's not right.  Its not tailored at the waist any so it's not form fitting at all.  So now I wish I would of got a small instead but I usually do go in ordering surprise things for the Mrs. Because she's always a "Medium".


I gave it 3 stars because it still looked nice to me even though it's not form fitting like I thought it would be.  Maybe if it's not to late to switch it for a small ... my review could get better.


cute and simple jersey dress for a casual night out


Exactly what I wanted


Loved it
