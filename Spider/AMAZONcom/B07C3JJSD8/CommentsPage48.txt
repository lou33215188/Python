Cute dress but had to return. I took it out of the package and the material was defective. Quality control needs to improve. Did not reorder.


I got this dress in black size small. Im about 5"5 175lbs most of my weight is in my belly and it looks great!


So huge! Looks like I am wearing my husbands huge under shirt


. It has no structure and is super thin. I have a couple other tops by this manufacturer, some run big like tho, and some are fine. It’s hit and miss.


Nice fabric. Drapes and fits well. Color same as on screen. I’ve gotten many compliments on it


Comfortable dress but very very thin material


What is a gift, looks really good on but get a size up.


nice green color....have the perfect scarf to go with the dress.


I love this! I wear a medium LLR Carly. This medium fit comparably.


Very comfortable and nice looking


I bought it large since I don't like clingy fabrics. It's really long so if you're hoping for a tunic, this is not it. Super comfy though and love the fabric. Colors for me were true to what I saw here.
