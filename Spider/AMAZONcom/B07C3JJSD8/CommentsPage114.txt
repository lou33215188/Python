Love this dress and got tons of compliments on it. Would love it in every color!


Doesnâ€™t look like a picture. Very simple material, not to go out with


Nice and comfy dress to go to for a quick stroll or shopping ğŸ˜†ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼


Comfy and works well with leggings underneath. Also, would work well for when I go swing dancing.


Love it, fits perfect!!!


Very comfortable and extremely soft material!  I love it.


Shorter than expected


Perfect! Just what I was looking for. Material is very forgiving. Selves aren't too tight.


So happy with this purchase! so comfy and wears great!


Not clingy. Runs small.
