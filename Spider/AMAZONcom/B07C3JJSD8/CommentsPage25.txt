Love these dresses. I originally ordered 2, they are so soft and comfortable that I ordered 2 more!! Great value!


Material is a little thin, but it's exactly how I expected. Comfortable, flow, cute.


I love this top it is well made the material is soft and comfortable, I also love the way it hangs and moves with you and it's very flattering to the figure, I'm going to definitely buy a couple more. I'm very pleased with my purchase.


My husband bought me this for Christmas, tried it on and fits great, nice and soft, light weight material. This will be nice year round looks good with tights, nice and airy for summer!


Fantastic dress for the price. The material is very nice, holds its shape and is very stretchy. I bought 6 of these dresses to take on a vacation to a very hot and humid area and they were great! I hung the on a hanger and sprayed them with water and any wrinkles from being packed were pretty much gone. Another reason they're great is they can be dressed up or down easily depending on shoes and accessories. I am 5'7" and the dress length was just below my knees.


Love the soft, comfy material!


Color vibrant & am very well pleased! Exceptional value!!


I love this dress. I ordered 3 colors. Mother orice was very reasonable.  I am thinking about ordering more!  Love this!


LOVE this dress!  This is the second one that I've ordered, just in a different color.  I've received so many compliments on it.  Great material, perfect fit, just what I expected.  It can be dressed up, or down, depending on the occasion.  I'm 5'7", 145 lbs., and I purchased a medium.  A large would have been too big.  I would absolutely recommend this product!


So soft and comfortable! Love it and can't wait to buy more!


I am plus size and it still flows perfectly


To long  for a dress or a top.
