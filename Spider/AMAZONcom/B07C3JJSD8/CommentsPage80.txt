Really cute and comfy.  Perfect for the south Florida weather.  I bought this in four colors.  They wash beautifully and I hang to dry.


Love that it can be dressed up or worn casually.


Love it! It goes well with leggings, and it's super soft.


Fits well, true to size...wrinkles fairly easily tho.  White needs cami or something under, as lightweight fabric can be a bit revealing.


It was not what I was expecting however it will make a great nightgown.


Enjoyed the trying on and swirling around to check it out.  Will wear to special functions  Thank you


So far I love it. Picking out other colors I want. I'm 5'5" 125 lbs and got a small.  Fits great, very flowy.  Plenty long which I like, almost knee length on me.  Will probably hand wash.


Very soft and like the length, but it's very clingy, so everything underneath the dress is outlined.


Cute color!  Very fall


My daughter loved this dress
