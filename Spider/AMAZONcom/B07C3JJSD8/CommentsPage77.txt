Great fit and a great dress!


Arrived fast and good price. The fabric is thin and the sleeves are short and tight. Using it for a swimsuit cover up.


I love this dress. Goes well with leggings. It does run true to size/slightly big. Great quality!


perfect sizing and is very comfortable


I liked the feel of this dress so well that I bought 4 more.  I plan to wear them all summer


Love this dress, perfect fit.


Extremely thin material is not something I would normally purchase. I would not wear it without a jacket and/or slip to have so form of privacy. Love the color and the fit.


Very comfortable, washes great, looks great with leggings.


very comfy!


Comfortable, flattering style for the price.
