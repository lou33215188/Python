Very soft material.  Would be good as a nightie.  Pink was thin and VERY see through.  Length is a little strange.  Short for a conservative dress, to long for stealthy pants.  Belt needed to make it work


Thin fabric, but love that it doesn't cling and reaches my knees.  Great for hot summer weather.


Love this Dress. I wear it with my leggings and my skirts. It is so pretty. The fit was just right.


LOVE this dress!  Seriously so comfortable and very flattering.


I love these shirts. I have the same one in black. They are long enough to be worn as dresses for sure.


Soft fabric, fits snug and form fitted so if you don't like every lump and bump showcased, size up... Im gonna wear it arojnd the house anx to sleep in...


I love the feel and fit but it is extremely thin. It should be listed as a see through. I don't want to have to wear another shirt under it but I have no choice.


Omg...you will love this. Plus size women order it. It is true to size and I feel great in it. Other vendors are misleading and don't fit to size. You have to be a tooth pic to fit in most clothes on Amazon. Trust me I have ordered a lot of clothes on Amazon. Thank you Belaroi!


Fabric is very soft and slinky.  I do not actually have the figure that is conducive to wearing a dress like this out of the house (it does not hide any imperfections, but I need orange for my online classroom, it is very comfortable, and it is perfect.


Got the yellow and navy blue for a short vacation where it would be hot and it was PERFECT! I'm 5'1'', 125lbs and it was a great fit--came just slightly above the knees. The material is soft and light but didn't feel cheap. Highly recommend if you want something comfy and casual
