I was surprised at how this fit! I had purchased another dress somewhat similar from a different seller and it didn't fit like i imagined and it also clung to me in an unflattering way! I have a little more cushion so for this to fit really well surprised! I will definitely be buying more colors in the future!


New favorite shirt. Goes well with a waist belt and some funky printed leggings.


Love my dress thank you!


Fabric is very thin and sleepy. The garment appeared to be made well however, the fabric is unacceptable.


Overall pleased with this dress; does fit a little small in the bust area and fabric is a bit thin but goodnitem for the price. Be sure to note that these dresses/tunics have an uneven hem design - longer to front and back, and raised on the sides.


Very nice especially for the price. It was a little big ( I bought a large) but that is an ego boost. The dress is simple enough that the size can be accommodated.  It came on the day it was promised.


Soft and comfy dress...looks nice on. Easily can be dressed up or down with accessories.


Great summer dress


comfy and swingy.  I do wish the arm holes were a bit deeper.


Looks great on my wife,  She loves it.
