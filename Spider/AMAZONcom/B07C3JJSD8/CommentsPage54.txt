Looks great, my wife wear all the time


Very thin and no pocket. Nice but not what I expected


I love this dress. It fit perfectly. I can wear a belt with it or not. Looks great.


Cute navy swing tunic!


Fit true to size with just the right amount of room. Long enough to be worn without tights. Material is very comfortable but does wrinkle easily


excellent


Very cute, light and comfortable. Would give it 5 stars but very see through.


Dress has a stain on the front...not wearable.  Will need to return.


I have purchases several of these shirts from different companies.  I especially loved the ones with the brand name,  Belaroi, because they weren't as long as other brands and for me better.  I ordered them again but this time they are way longer (down to my knees).  Ugh


This dress is too shapeless and dumpy looking. I am returning it.
