Love my swing tops! Perfect with cute leggings and great to teach in!


Too big, it fit like a nightgown


Most comfortable dress ever


Love these dresses!


Fits great. Exactly what I ordered!


Very comfy and will order in other colors.


This dress is just not right for me.  It clings in all the places that I wanted it to camouflage and is loose everywhere I wanted to accent.  The material is thin and floaty and I really liked how it felt on.  Just didn't like how it looked when I moved.  Standing still in front of the mirror it was cute.  Then I started walking and I could see every cellulite dimple, underwear line, and bulges that I wasn't even aware I had.  It just was not flattering at all.  I am 5'4" and weight 135ish  and I ordered a medium.  I think instead of ordering another size that I'll go exercise.  This was a depressing purchase.


Just as pictured and described. Great casual dress.


Very comfortable


Cute, very comfortable and easy care.
