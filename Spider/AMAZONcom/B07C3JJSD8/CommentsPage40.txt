I ordered one of these and immediately ordered another once I got the first one. It's so comfortable and fits very well. Flattering shape. The fabric is a little thin but that's great for hot weather.


This is my new go-to dress. it's comfy and easy to dress up with accessories. Perfect for the days where I juts feel too chubby.


This is more like a dress than a tunic. I’m 5’4 and the hem lands at my knees. Material is a little to thin to be a dress in my opinion. Definitely need a slip.


Really happy with this long shirt/ dress. Love the fabric...nice and stretchy...love the color. I will be buying more.


Love this dress. Bought it for my knee surgery day since I figured I wouldn't be able to wear pants. Was such a great purchase and easy to slide on and off and I looked so cute.


First off, I love this hot pink color.  Looks great with my graying hair.  However, the tunic hit about my knees and I am 5'4".  All other tunics that I wear hit about thigh.  Material is very soft and fits comfortable.


It is a little longer than I expected because I got it to wear with leggings but I am happy with the purchase.


Fits so comfortable and the material is nor see thru.


It is a great product, but it may be just me, it seem shorter in the back than in the front.


Longer than I thought it would be, but love the fabric and have been wearing it as a nightshirt
