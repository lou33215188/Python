I love this dress.. Would be getting other clours.. The quality is just as described..


Soft and comfy! Covers all my needs!


A little too small but fits okay. Nice material and color.


Hem was uneven, did not like.


I purchased this dress in three colors, black, purple and fushia!  I am well satisfied with the colors and the fit since I tried them all on, however have not worn one yet!


bad fit to small


Love color and style


Nice cloth for the price.Fits perfectly.


Perfect fit and feel.  May order other colors


Nice and soft. But sizing is way off. And material is then
