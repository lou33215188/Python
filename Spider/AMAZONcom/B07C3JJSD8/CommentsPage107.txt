The color was more orange than red.


AMAZING dress. Very comfortable and lightweight. It is a little more on the airy side, so I wouldnâ€™t recommend getting a size up.


Fits great


Love the dress! I recommend ordering a size smaller than you need. Mine was a bit too big but after washing and drying if fits perfect.


Love it


I love this top!


Love it!


Nice fitting, comfortable, material is wonderful.  I liked it so well I bought another in a different color.


Fit wash rest! Soft, flowy fabric! Color true to picture! Length is great - I'm 5'8" and the dress comes right above my knee!


Pretty, soft. Very nice dress, easy to wear.
