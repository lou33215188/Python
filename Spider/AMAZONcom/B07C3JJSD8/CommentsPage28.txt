Nice soft material and a beautiful pink.  It was a little wide for a large, but I wore it anyhow.  Looked cute with black leggings and cute low heel pink pumps!


It fits as expected and the material is better than expected.


I loved this dress until I washed it.  The color faded, the material wrinkled beyond repair, I only got one wear out of it now it's a night gown


Beware the color descriptions.  "Brick red" is, well, ORANGE.


I actually ordered a couple of these as summer nightshirts when visiting family, but they're also great belly-hiding little dresses (I'm 5' 4" and maybe 170 lbs-- mostly muscle, I swear) which hang around my thighs, at about the halfway point. I like wearing little dresses like this in the summer, with capris.


The shirts are pretty but the the fabric is thin. One of these shirts frayed after one wash. Not really worth the cost. Cheap.


Perfect fit. I'm planning on using this as a quick pull on over leggings during the winter.


A little thin, but it's super comfortable and hasn't lost its shape or color. I mostly wear it with leggings, it's a little short to wear without.


Just what I was looking for. A casual comfy dress that goes anywhere. Very light weight, very packable, takes up very little space when traveling. Hides many figure flaws. I ordered the black and may go back and order other colors.


I am normally a Large and bought the XL as I wanted it larger and comfy. GREAT dress. light weight and very comfy. bought 3 colors and will be buying the rest <3 totally worth the price.


Iâ€™m very impressed with the quality & fast delivery of these dresses! I bought three in size medium (Iâ€™m 5â€™7 & 140 lbs) they fit me perfectly!
