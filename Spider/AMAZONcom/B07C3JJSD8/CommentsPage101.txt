It's adorable! I got a lot of compliments today when I wore it!


Very poor quality. Too sheer to possibly wear. Returning.


Size chart is good fits every where . Sleeves are a little big . Iâ€™m 5 ft 175 and the large fits well .


Great shirt. Would order more in other colors.


great dress.


Very cute on.  Has a light feel too it without being able to see though it. Loved it I got 3 more in different colors.


I love these dresses are using for business through a scarf on the jacket and they're perfect


Great quality!


Easy wash and wear looks great with a sheath and sandals for work


Super comfy! Light material
