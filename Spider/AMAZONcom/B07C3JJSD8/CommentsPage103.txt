Supposed to be a tunic...it's to the knees!  Way too long


I ordered the size I wear and its a little snug...So if I reordered I'd go up one size for sure...


Soft and great colors! Iâ€™m ordering more. Size is true! ğŸ˜ƒ


Will purchase again!


Great dress, especially for the price.  I've gotten lots of compliments on it already and just wore it for the first time!


I like this dress and would give it more stars but the color is not khaki.  It is more of a pinkish with brown undertones.


Very comfortable fabric. It is snug in the bust but flowy in the waist. I love it!


fits perfectly and very comfy.


I expected it to be longer.  I didn't see the length in the description when I was purchasing


Soft and comfortable. Love it.
