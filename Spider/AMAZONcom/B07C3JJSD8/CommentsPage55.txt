Nice but has a really strong smell of ?dye? Or something chemical.


Super soft. Lightweight material but not too thin.


It's a bit thin but not see through. Easy to throw on with a statement necklace and sandals and be ready to go. It was larger than expected it looked more like a night shirt before I messed around with accessorizing it but it is a good staple to have in your closet.


Cute, soft, great little dress. Has a nice stretch.


Such a great deal on a swing dress. Comfort and fit. Couldnâ€™t ask for more


My daughter loves it with leggings. Cute!


Lots of color washed out and fabric wrinkles easily! Fits as expected .


Comfy feels more like a nightgown. The swing top is dress length. Color is pretty.


Perfect fit and comfy material.  Wish it had size pockets but it came exactly as described.  Very satisfied.


Too tight in the arms for me but a really cute dress
