The fabric is very thin, much like a cheap t-shirt or nightgown. The sizing  runs a bit small. I got one size bigger thinking better safe than sorry; and that I would take it to be altered. It is form fitting across the chest and you can see right through.  I will keep it only because it will be something to sleep in on hot summer nights.


love this dress... I ordered 6 more different color dresses just like it..  that's how much I love this dress.


Great dress to dress up, place scarf, necklace or keep simple.  Material washes well, just hang to dry.


Love this shirt! Ordered it to wear at my baby shower at 36 weeks (size large) and it was so comfortable! I'm 5'11" and DDD bra size, it covered my butt and front like I wanted. My Lularu addictied friend had it mistaken for one of their products.


Very comfortable, true to size. Only complaint is the white one I bought is very see through. The purple one I bought is fine.


This dress is very comfortable, however, I am not sure if I would wear it out very often. It seems more like a nightgown than a dress on me. Normally when I buy larger sizes, it's because I like my dresses a little more comfortable, but in this case, I think I purchased too large, which I cannot blame the seller for. But with the right accessories, this dress is great!


Material quality is fine, but the sizes are off, product smaller than normal sizes.  So order two sizes bigger, and pray they don't srink.


I have two of these; one in purple and the other is gray. They're a great length for leggings but they're that slinky material that shows every lump and bump so keep that in mind if you're body concious. I love them though!


It's a very nice dress to throw on and go just add sandals


Very true to size. Very flowy dress and not see thru. Have not washed yet so not sure if it shrinks.
