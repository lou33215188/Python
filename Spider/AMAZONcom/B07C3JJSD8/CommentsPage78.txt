Love this!  Soft and flattering!


Not what I expected


I love the material and how the dress fits. Dress is a little see through. Will be keeping


The fabric is way to thin for me and it's to streachy.  I would not buy another one.


Very comfortable


Wife loves comfort of top and wears it often.


Really nice material.  Wasn't sure how I'd use these. Sure they could be dressed up with a large pendant, tights, and booties, but they're so soft and comfy I use them for Jammie's.


Item is too small.


Great little dress for casual wear!


Fits like it should. Well made.
