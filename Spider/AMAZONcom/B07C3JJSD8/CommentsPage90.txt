Well Made, Soft Comfortable, Great Price


Love the super soft material. Fits great. Have comments everywhere I go


Was cute and what I wanted but it is too big. I’m 5’3.5 and 120lbs. I ordered the small. The material is nice and stretchy though.


love love love dress, and it was a very quick turn delivery, thank you!


Love


The fabric is so soft.


I love it. I love the softness and the color. So ready for the summer.


Was to clingy not to small not made out of good material would be better in cotton or something like that.


Very good length. Would have given 5 stars but fabric is a little thinner than expected.


Great product, my wife loves the fit and how soft it is!
