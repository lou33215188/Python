great fit... soft material...perfect in every way.


Best length ever


Fabric thinner than expected, but very comfortable!! I love it as an everyday dress! Flows nicely!


Beautiful color a little too thin


Not flattering at all. Turned it into a night shirt.


It fits great! I wear a med/lg in general so I ordered the large so it could be flowy as intended and I love it. The fabric is very soft and it hits just above my knee.


So soft and comfortable.


I love how bouncy and comfortable it is


Wife says she loves it and it fits great!!!


Price speaks for the quality.  Just washed the top as directed and itâ€™s now short on left side and longer on right. Cheaply made.
