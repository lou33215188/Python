I love this dress! I bought it in four colors. They are all gorgeous. The dress is very comfortable, a light fabric without too much cling. Fits in the bust with a graceful swing at the hem. Love love love. Will wear it all summer.


I'm enjoying my shirt and it's just right.


Very soft, cute casual dress - love it with a jean jacket for many seasons


better if thicker material


Very soft and pretty.


The material is very thin.  It is too short for me.  Not very happy with this.  Cheap.


super smooth and comfy!


Color not sky blue but dark turquoise.


Very thin fabric that is see through.


Nice dress, very soft and comfy.
