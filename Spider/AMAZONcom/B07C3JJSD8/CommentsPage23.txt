I love it and fits great...great price too might buy a other one in  other color ...not sure yet


Soft, Flowy . I use it as a shirt for leggings as I have a very long torso.


This dress is so comfortable!  I ordered one of every color.  It is great for casual occasions, but can also be dressed up a bit as well.  So versatile; I love it!


Love love this dress.  I'm always warm. And over weight , it hard to find something  lose and comfortable . This dress is cut very full and really soft material .  But has a shape to it. I just order 2 more!!


I had read the reviews so it was exactly as expected -- material is on the thin side however I would prefer to layer if chilled rather than sweat to death.  I normally wear a size 20 and had ordered the 3X based on the reviews and it fits perfectly.  The length is good, too, to wear with leggings (I am 5'9").  For the price I think it was a great deal.


These are super cute. I wouldn't say they run small but they are very fitted. If I didn't have a good back smoothing bra I probably wouldn't like them! Other than that, they're great.


The fabric is so soft! Feels great! I wanted it as a lightweight nightgown as cotton doesn't stretch... Love it.


I love these shirts. Quality so far is good. FIT is loose and I am a DD so it's is comfy not tight. I usually order a 22/24. I ordered a 3x I tried a 2x but it is tighter around my chest and sticks closer to my belly fat but I can still wear that size too. My only wish to make them better would be pockets but I can deal with out.


Great "around the house" dress, but also could be dressed up as well.  Very comfortable.


This is a cute little dress. The material is pretty thin- I wish it were a little thicker but it swings nicely and hits about mid thigh on me (I'm 5' 7") It looks very cute with fun leggings, boots, and a scarf.
