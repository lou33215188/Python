Didn't really fit the way I thought it would but it's a beautiful color


This is a beautiful dress.  I wore it with leggings and got so many compliments on it.  I decided to buy it in three other colors.


It's a little clingy.


I will order more colors.


OH my goodness I bought this dress for my daughter and simply love it she looks amazing in it I am going to buy this dress for myself.


The fabric is amazingly soft. Fits very well.


I am usually a size small. I wanted the dress to go just a little above my knees but it is almost past them.  If you are looking for a long tshirt dress though definitely the item to get


Beautiful orange color! A little see through, but more sheer than expected. Great fit. I'm normally a Large in tips, but ordered the medium and it fits perfectly.


Fabric was EXTREMLY thin.~; showed my brawl and panty lines.


Like very much bought several colors.
