LOVE it fits great material for the long sleeve is a bit more clingy than the short sleeve but still LOVE it and want one in Every Color!! I have bought 5 of them now 2 long sleeve and 3 short sleeve. Will buy more for sure!! Ships super fast, comes wrinkled but I wash it before I wear it so no big deal to me.


Love this inexpensive, comfortable tunic!  Material is soft and hangs perfect.  Just right to wear with leggings.  Care tab says hand wash in cold, but I don't do hand wash, put this in my washer on perm press, cold water and tumbled dry on perm press.  Came out perfect. Need to wash first because of funny smell on cloth, but a washing took the smell completely away.


First let me say that I ordered up on this dress, I am a 16W I can usually fit a 1x but ordered a 3x in this dress.. This dress is very comfortable and the material is soft, I had original ordered one and when it came in and I tried it on I went back and ordered 2 more.. It is the type of dress that you can wear casually or dress it up.ğŸ‘�ğŸ�½ğŸ˜�


I love the color and the fabric is very soft. Trie it on and the fit is great.  This will be a great go to dress. There smell when I opened the package but I'm sure that it's from the plastic and will be gone as soon as I wash it.


The perfect casual dress to wear with my Chuck Taylors! The army green color will be great for many seasons, plus the dress can also be worn as a tunic with leggings. So many possibilities. I typically wear a size 6 and went with a medium, because I wanted it to be loose. I'm sure a small would have worked too.


It's a perfect fall piece. It could actually be worn without leggings if you're short (which I am 5'2"). I'm excited to add this to my wardrobe and will probably be buying several colors. It is a little thin, but I don't mind that.


Do not get yellow, white or ivory as it is see through!  I bought aqua and though a light color it isn't see through.  Get a half slip when wearing yellow.  That's what I have to get now, a half slip if not a full slip.  However, this looks good on or makes me look good; I don't know which...and this is what we want.


I love this top! Just what I was looking for. It drapes and flows beautifully and is nice and cool (and not see through). I have a pear shape figure, a 37 inch bust with 46 inch hips so I was a little unsure what size to get, but a size large fits perfectly. The length was longer than I expected for someone of my height (5' 5"). It hit me a tiny bit above the knees, but I actually am glad of this. I like more fabric around the lower part of my body. Definitely will be getting more in the future :)


This dress was too see through, and I will be returning it. You can see in the picture that in direct light the dress is completely sheer. The material is thin and not very good quality. Iâ€™m not sure if the darker colors would work better and would be opaque, but just in case for sizing references Iâ€™m 5â€™2, 36C, and 170 pounds, and the medium fit just fine. It wouldâ€™ve been cute if it wasnâ€™t so see through.


I very much liked it: soft, swingy, comfortable...but I'm guessing it's 1.5 sizes too large.  One size larger can be ignored because of the terrific swing movement.  The fabric is soft and seems sturdy, but it's also on the sheer side.  Also, the neckline is lower than I'm used to,  Would be helpful to have a removable contrasting dickie or straight "tank" neckline.


  When I received and tried the dress on,  within 3 min I knew I'd gift it to a larger friend who is a wheelchair rider and I know she will love the movement and flexibility of the fabric.  Now I'll go back and order 2 or 3 smaller ones for me!  (and probably a cotton camisole, too)
