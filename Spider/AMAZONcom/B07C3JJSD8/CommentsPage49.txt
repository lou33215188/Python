Really thin material but it is a nice tunic dress


LOVE this dress - PERFECT for going hiking or as a beach cover-up. Not too tight, beautifully flowy, but not frumpy. Hits just above the knee. Easy to dress up with a scarf or sweater, or lounge in with leggings underneath.  I'm 43, 5'7", 212#.


Probably would have looked great if it fit me, but it was just too big.


The material is so thin that the mustard yellow is see through. I will be sending this back.


Soft and swingy. Did not expect hemline to be circular.


Great to hang around the house in.


I love this dress. It is comfortable and fits me well. Will order another color of same dress.


These are the softest cotton night gowns. The fabric is light and breathable. The only down side is that the material is too thin to be worn outside as a dress.


Looser style dress. Still really comfy & I plan to wear with my leggings


Nice quality tee shirt dress. I did not care for color or hemline.
