Probably my favorite purchase ever. Once I purchased this I bought 9 more colors. Some different styles. This is a quality product.


This is a great dress. 5'3, 170. Large is perfect. It's light and swingy, perfect for 3 seasons. I wear it with a jeans jacket. I will get more in different colors.


Very cute and comfy dress. Perfect with leggings


Inexpensive. Kinda thin and cheap feeling.  Hope the seams and hem don't come apart after a few washes. You get what you pay for.


I love that the dress is stretchy but it's too thin for my taste.  It is a soft material. I'm keeping it because I like it enough to wear on a hot, casuasl day.


Perfect fit, great length! Fabric moves and is easy to care for! I love this dress!


The fabric is thin but not see-through, color is accurate and attractive. The cut is fit-and-flare doing both of those well and in the right places.  The hemline is a little long for me at 5’5 but workable.


Cute and comfy. Soft. Looks best with a belt


I am in love with my dresses. They are wonderful. I will probably buy a few more in other colors. They are like butter, soft and flowing. I love, love, love them


I liked the dress, however the material is so thin and with a light color one can see right through it. Maybe good as a bathing suit cover up when it doesn’t matter that you can see underneath.
