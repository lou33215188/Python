LOVE the dress, and the material, I should have bought larger for length


Nice dress for a hot day, but the hemline is a little quirky.


Very pretty and beautiful color! Flowy on a curvy body.


It's kind of long for a tunic but too short to be a dress. I usually knot the side and wear it with leggings.


Material is so nice


Perfect little dress to take on vacation. Packs great. Add jewelry and your set to go.


Wish the sleeves were a bit longer


Given to me as a gift. Absolutely love it. Soft, light weight, perfect size, length is great even for a middle aged woman, can be dressed up or casual.


Ordered a size larger to make it more loose and it still looks good.


Very soft, color is rich. The fabric is thin but not see through at all.
