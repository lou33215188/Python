This is a very comfortable dress and not see-through.  The only problem I have with it...it is a little short.


Fits like a dream and hides all flaws. Long enough that I can wear it to work, yet not looking frumpy. Will be purchasing this in another color for sure


Bought for my teenage daughter - she loved it


Bit larger than expected. Kinda baggy in the sleeves but still a cute dress overall for the price.


Love the fit, the color the material, it looks amazing on. Perfect Fall wear, if it gets a little cool just through a cardigan over it,


Highly recommend....


Love this!  Super comfy!  Great fit!  Very cute!


I really LOVE how this dress fits. I usually wear a size 18/20 and its loose enough to be flowy. The color is very vibrant and pretty close to the color shown (I got the forest green). I'm 5'2" and it hits me right at my knees. I wore it with leggings and brown boots. It looks good without a belt, but a belt would give it more shape.


Hard to find for my 83 year old mother with limited mobility petite anc plus size ... absolutely love ❤️


Fits perfectly -  good quality both in feels and looks.  Can be dressed up or just worn casual.  Purchasing more in different colors.


Love it! Super soft and very pretty  Fast shipping
