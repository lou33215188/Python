My wife likes it, it is great for casual wear, best use so far... beach wear for over a swim suit.


Fit as expected.  I am 5'1 and about 140, ordered a size large.  Hit me right above the knee.  Soft material.


I ordered 2X. Fit great. Then I laundered it following directions carefully.. now it fits my size small daughter. As a shirt.


Nice tunic.  Fits fine.  Looks like the picture.  Seems to be well made.  Good value for the price.


Arrived when scheduled and fits wonderfully. The fabric is very soft and stretchy and I really enjoy wearing it


Definitely not what I expected. Fabric is much thinner. I’m going to keep it to wear around the house but would never buy it again. The hem is like a shark tail, and it’s much shorter than I would like for outside the house.


Great shirt, flowy but a good shape... soft, very comfortable, great with leggings because it covers everything.  Runs a little large (which is better than a little small!) but if you are between two sizes, go with the lower one.


Only complaint is that it wrinkles easily (but that comes with the soft, comfortable, cotton!!)


I love this dress! It's so comfortable & cute. I can't wait to get another one!


This dress is okay, another great option that you can dress up. Only thing I am not a fan of is the material is a bit clingy. It tends to bunch around my stomach area which isn't the most flattering. I originally bought it as something to dress up and wear to my office job but for now its lounge wear around the house :)


Super cute and comfy, bought to wear to my sorority’s philanthropy event!
