I love the color and the fabric of this dress.... it is a bit shorter than I anticipated but I can deal with that.


This was even better than I expected. It is the PERFECT cut for me - I will be ordering more colors!


Love the way it looks and feels!!


Love this top!  The fit is very attractive and lays in the right place.  No need to iron, just throw in the dryer!


Love this dress. I can wear all my crazy leggings with it. It is a lot thinner than I expected. That just means I can wear it in the summer


Great fit and price!


Dress was the perfect length for me to wear with leggings to work. I am 5â€™7 and it worked great for me.


I love this dress! It fits true to size and it is so soft and comfortable! I might have to buy one in every color ğŸ˜€


Fabric is thinner than I would like, but style and fit are good.


I like how comfy it is, but I'm not wild about the color. I got it to support UVA!!
