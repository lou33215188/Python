Great price for a good product.


Packaged really well. Much nicer than I expected and a great bargain. It’s perfect for work and so comfortable! I’m 5’8” 160lbs and purchased a large because I like a looser, more comfortable fit.


This is the worst. Thin material to short and 3x is like a large. How do i get my money back.


Beautiful color! Fits very nice. Great quality.  Can wear casual or dressy.  I ordered 4 different colors


!Super soft and long enough so it isn't too short. Its perfect for my cosplay I will using it for. Will buy again if I need or want a flow pretty shirt dress!!


I was skeptical about this fitting, but after trying it on I am in love. I am a size 26 and got the 3x. It fits well and is  super comfortable. I am going to order more in different colors!


Loved the color and style.  Really light great for hot weather.


I will probably try a 3x next time. The 2x fit great but i just dont like when it sticks to me shows my tummy when i walk lol


But overall GREAT BUY will buy soon!!


Love these tunic dresses. So colorful, soft and flowey.


Wifie happy
