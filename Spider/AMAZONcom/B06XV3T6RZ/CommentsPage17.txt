Super cute dress and fits well. Love the pockets.  It is a light weight dress, so you may need a slip or spandex underneath.


So comfortable,  love the convenience of the pockets


Very cute dress. I am 5' 7" and a medium was long enough for me. Bright pink color,.


Nice material, fits well, very comfortable, but had a strange stain on the front of the dress. Other than that, the quality is about what you would expect for a dress at this price range--some loose threads but still decent, the material is great and doesn't feel cheap. The pockets are nice, but they do add a little bulk to the hip area. If it weren't for the mystery stain I would have given this dress 4/5 stars.


I get SO many compliments on this dress - and it has POCKETS!!  Love it - comfy and pretty.  Fun, sundress!


Runs a little big, but is comfy, casual and cute.  I love the pockets!!


The pockets on this dress are deep and hold items well. The dress is cool and flowy without feeling too short.


Kind of big, could get away with a smaller size than you normally wear but the color is true to the picture and its very comfortable and cute to dress up or down!


Cute dress, little longer than I prefer (I am 5'4"-generally sz S) but would be cute if it was not so huge. Runs very large, not just because of trapeze style, even arms and cold shoulder were hanging off of me. May exchange for smaller if they have it.


The chemical smell on this was horrific. It was like a pesticide. Still there after washing. Had to throw it out
