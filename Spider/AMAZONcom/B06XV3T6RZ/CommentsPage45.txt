Nice summer dress.


I love love love this top. Fits perfectly and is super comfortable


Cute but didn't fit good


Fit ok but fabric very light weight so was less than flattering on plus size body


Love this dress and it fit perfectly. I am nervous buying clothes from the internet but I love this dress.


Perfect fit, can be worn as casual, or dressed up, for summer with sandals and in winter with tall boots, very versatile. And has pockets!!!


Fits perfectly. Can be worn with a belt or without to change up the look. Very light and comfortable.


cute kick around dress


Fits true to size and is a great value.  Can be dressed up with "statement" jewelry and heals (I had several compliments when I wore it for a wedding), or casual with sandals!


This dress is so cute. It's not clingy, but form fitting. It's also super soft. It does have a hole in one of the pockets, but I don't plan on actually carrying anything in the pockets. I love it!
