So cute and yet so comfortable. Lightweight soft material and it has pockets!! Great dress!


Very happy with this dress!


Super comfortable and flattering. I got it in green and it's just lovely. Would definitely buy again!


Love the dress. Flattering and forgiving. I've gotten many complements.


Love this dress!!! So comfortable and flattering if you're on the heavier/curvier side. I usually wear a large/XL depending on the item and I ordered a medium in this dress and it fits amazing. Still loose like pictured on the model but not too big


Great fit for 5'2", 36 D and 127 lb almost-60-year-young woman...also perfect length at mid-knee.


The dress is ok, smelled like smoke when I opened the package.


Very comfortable and flattering.  Love that it is cotton.


Used this dress as a base for my Halloween costume. It works perfectly.


Too large and cheaply made
