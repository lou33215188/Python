Fits great


Love this item....just didn't know it was dry clean only :(


Cute dress for a woman who is heavier than she should be! Looks good on me! Very comfortable!


Great fun dress .....!


Super adorable!


I really liked this dress. It fits as expected and it's comfortable.  I wore it to a wedding and it was very appropriate.


It fits everywhere except the length. I am 5'3 and it is too short for me! I bend over and you can see my goodies. It is a dress you have to wear with tights.


Love it


just ok
