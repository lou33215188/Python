Quality is not great. Looks cheap.


Fits perfect and very comfortable. Love this dress, glad I bought more than one.


The fit is ok, mostly comfortable.  I was sad to see that the army green/olive color was very muted, almost to a tan/olive color. I returned due to color.


Wore this on the beach.. many compliments


Love the dress!! Fits nice. I may get another in a different color


Love it! Perfect fit. Definitely ordering in another color.


Very soft and great quality for the price. And it has pockets!!


The best part is the pockets, fits wonderfully,


Dress is comfortable, amazing dress.


I can wear anywhere


This dress is so cute and so comfortable! Very affordable too. Very happy with my purchase. All
