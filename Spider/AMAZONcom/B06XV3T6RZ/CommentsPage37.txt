I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and the small hung off me. It is super baggy and looked like a large Tshirt. It would be perfect if it they had an XS I think.


I ordered this in Brown and Black. The brown one was perfect, but the black one had holes in the pockets and wasn't seamed well,  I threw it in my charity box.


Fits perfectly!


Beautiful dress. Light weight, easy to wear and cones in gorgeous colors! I bought two! Runs very big though so definitely size down! I wear a M and had to exchange for a small and it is still a bit big.


Love it! Wore all the time in Cabo. A bit baggy but so easy and the pockets are great!


Based on the reviews, I thought I should buy a size up. However, it was a little bigger than I expected. It still looked nice. I would definitely buy another one in my exact size (L) The fabric is very comfortable.


Will be great for summer vacation


This is a very cut and comfortable dress.


Will buy this in other colors! Love it!


Extremely comfortable!
