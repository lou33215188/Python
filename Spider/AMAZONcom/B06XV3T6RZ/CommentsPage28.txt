easy to wear, arrived a bit wrinkled and will need ironing but fit great and looked good on my size 12 frame.


It jus wasn't flattering on me.


Love this dress. Would buy it in every color. Perfect to dress up or wear casual. Comfortable, soft, and love the pockets! Would buy again!


Very cute on


The material is not that good, but it's pretty


Nice little dress that I’ll we’re with capris leggings because my knees aren’t that pretty. Runs true to size.


Love it! Bought the purple & liked it so much that I ordered the pink! I am 5'6" & weigh 126. The small fits perfect.


I love this summer dress.  I bought it in three colors (navy, pink and cobalt).  I might buy more and use it to layer in other seasons.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!


To short from the back, the drop sleeves are to big


I liked the color.


The fit and material was so thin.
