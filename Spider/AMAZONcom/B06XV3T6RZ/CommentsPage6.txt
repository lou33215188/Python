Purchased as just a casual dress.  Fit it as expected.  I was looking for a "t-shirt" type material.  This is a little thinner.  It's very comfortable.  I didn't think I would like the pockets but do.  This will look cute in the fall/winter with a cardigan or jean jacket.


I really like this dress. I am 5â€™3â€� and weigh 162lbs and I ordered the white dress. Usually I wear x-large because I am busty and enough junk in trunk. But thanks to the reviews I thought maybe I will order a large, so I did. Then came back to reviews and saw on review that made me rethink the large so canceled the order and reordered a medium. I am so glad I did because the medium fits perfectly. Iâ€™m shocked that I can say I wear a medium in something but I can now. They run big and I am not tall and it fit approximately 2-3 inches above my knee, which one review advises short people not to buy because it was too long. But I think if you get the size right you will win. Plus I am curvy so it took a little length that way too. Fit was still loose but not floating in it. I would recommend to buy. I might even buy the pink.


I just receive my package today I was very excited so I decided to try it on to see how it fit I have to say I have a very big butt and the dress fit short on my backside..and the material thin I like the color but I think I will end up giving this dress away to my sister once again..


Love it!!!  Very comfortable and sexy dress.


I had gotten this dress in navy and was not very pleased with the fabric. This dress I love. The fabric is great. It does not wrinkle easily. The style is very cute and it looks good on. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish, comfortable dress.


Looks absolutely beautiful but is pretty transparent.  I have to wear something underneath since I wore it to work,  But still worth the purchase


I am about 5'1 and about a 23 waist. This dress is way too big for me. It went past my knees and it looked kind of like a sheet on me. The pockets are a very nice touch though and it is a very soft and stretchy fabric. It is also a good color. I would recommend to a taller person.


I'm 5'7 and the dress is shorter than pictured. It's cute but I wish it was longer so I could wear it in the summer. I can wear it during the fall/winter months with opaque tights or leggings. I like that it has pockets and it's loose around the waist/hip area.


I purchased the red one in XL. Absolutely gorgeous color for summer. A true bright red. I was trying not to get my hopes up high because this is the third cold shoulder dress I've purchased  (all from different sellers). This dress from this seller is the only one that truly fits flowy like it's supposed to be. My confidence is through the freaking roof in this. I didn't even want to take it off. So excited to wear this tomorrow when I go out for dinner. ğŸ˜€ Oh and because it has pockets, it has my vote even more!


This is one of the best dresses I've bought in a long time.  It is so comfortable wash is well and turned a lot of heads. We are casual or dress up with tights and boots in the winter. I love it can't wait to buy more. Can't beat the price !
