This is a super cute and comfy dress, and is suprisingly flattering for plus sized girls as well! I work it with a thin black belt to dinner and the red was quite an attention getter!


I love this dress. Very light and comfortable. I’m tempted to buy more colors but I don’t want to end up just wearing these all week. I just ordered a long sleeve version for the fall. We’ll see how that does.


I love everything about this dress! The color is bold as pictured, it falls perfectly on my shoulders, it comes right above my knee and it’s great solid material. I wear a medium (8/10) and bought a medium and it’s a perfect fit. Can’t wait to wear this soon!!!


I went back and forth on getting a small or medium. Very Happy with the small. I am 5'2 and 128 lbs. Received several compliments on this dress... and who doesn't love a dress with pockets. Will likely order in other colors.


It looks really cute in the picture but I got it in the mail and the material is just too thin. wish it was of thicker material and no so see through. cute idea though


I love the color & cold shoulder.  There is no shape to this dress.  Then I was at Walmart & found this dress.  It was more shapely & seriously 1/2 the price of this dress.


Dress is well made and really cute.  Size is super small - not US size scale.


This is the first dress I have bought from Amazon and it is amazing! I love the way it fits as well as the color, style, and everything about it! You can wear this casually or dress it up.


I love the pockets, and the material is light and comfortable. Shorter than I anticipated, but other than that it fits perfectly. For someone smaller, the length may not be an issue. Goes great with leggings, too.


Says it was cotton bug it was 100% ACRILIC!
