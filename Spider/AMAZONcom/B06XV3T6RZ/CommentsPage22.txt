Super cute! I had several compliments while wearing this dress.  Soooo comfortable! Absolutely in love with this one!


The stitching came out and I had to throw it away :(


Extremely comfortable, fits well, and I love the blue color. Can be dressed up or down easily and is very flattering! I paired it with leggings and it looks great!


I purchased larger size to have more length. Worked out great, comfortable and chic.


I like the way this one fits and like the cotton material.  Very comfy and good for a the beach as a cover up or for just chilling. :)


Love this!!! It is flattering and I love the open shoulders.


I'm an extra small or small. I ordered it in a small and it was perfect.


PS- I'm 5 and a half feet tall, never ever wear heels and 45 years old and it's not too short. And it had pockets! I highly recommend this.


I love this dress. Super comfortable and really pretty. A darn cute little black dress!


I love it  but it's thin.


This is one of my favorite dress so far. It's so great for the daily because is very fresh and comfortable. Also it works for a semi formal occasion if you add fabulous accessories and shoes to complete the outfit! I just love it!
