My daughter loves this dress and she hates wearing dresses!!  It looks really cute on her


Very worth the price. Seems to hold up really well to washing, super comfy and looks good on.


Wife loves this dress. She wants me to order a couple more in different colors.


Going to return this dress, way too big and baggy and I ordered a small. I'm 5'1 and I could barely reach the pockets. Very unflattering for my petite frame. Bummed cause it does appear to be good quality and super comfy! Wish it was available in XS.


Love these dresses! I bought the brown & orange. They're so comfy and love that they have pockets! Want to get more colors!!!!


I LOVE the style of this dress and length...looks really cute with big hoop earrings and drop necklace with boots.  However, the fabric is kind of cheap looking and doesn't seem to do well by machine washing.


The First time I wore this,  complements Galore!!


Ordering A Few  More !!


 Happy.....


Really like this dress! Comfy and flowy. Pockets are a plus! The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the dress had a horrible chemical smell and I had to wash it before even putting in my closet.  Good news is it washed wonderfully!


It fit true to size and is SUPER cute and the pockets are amazing, but it was slightly short for my liking. I’m 5’6” got an xl and came about to my finger tips on my thighs.


Nice didn’t like the flimsy material but I’m a little chunky so might just be me
