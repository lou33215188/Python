Love this dress. Fits true to size and flattering. I got the black,  (makes you look slimmer) and it can be worn casual and dressy depending the shoes. I wear size 14/16 ans 5'3" and weigh 175 lbs and the XL fits perfect.


The dress itself looks cute. But it came dirty, with a huge hole, with loose threads and no labels or tags whatsoever.


Terrible!!!!


I'm 5'5 and a half and weigh about 128 and I ordered a medium- the item fit nicely. I was going for a boho vibe so the slightly loose fit was exactly what I wanted however I'm sure I could've gotten a small if I wanted a tighter/ neater look. It comes just above the knee on me, so it is perfect for school dress codes! Great material! great color! And had pockets which I love!!


This dress is very unflattering. It just hangs there. I am 5'3" 125lbs and bought a small. Maybe if your frame was more just flat without hips or anything it would be less unflattering. I will be returning it


love the dress simple summer dress.  can be dressed up or down.


i'm 165// 38 d// 5'3" dress hits 2" above knee i ordered an xl


i'm sure i could have gotten a lg. but i like loose body skimming fit.


the fabric is very nice,well made i dont think this will pill to quickly


happy, ordered another .


summer is hot here so i'm sure this will be cute and comfortable.


People stop me to ask where I got it!  I love the pockets. The pockets are great for  a key, lipstick, credit card, coupons etc  I can leave my iPhone7 in there short term.  After awhile  the phone is hanging down to my  knee.


 I am 5'2.5"  136lbs 35B it looks  FAB.


 I have this in two colors!


Very comfortable & it flows!!!! & the best part is the cold shoulder sleeves covers my arms somewhat.......


I thought I originally would need to order a XL but the "prior reviews" were dead on it!!!! So I ordered a L and it fits perfect.....it really pays to read all the reviews for sure......it also makes you feel great when you wear it like you can be young at any age! Dress it up with heels or wear nice sandals you decide.....it is so versatile with pockets also:)


I ended up ordering a different color also bc I love it so much!!!!


I order a med, I'm 5'2ish and 36dd, I'm


Always nervous about the bust part on dresses, well this fits nice and is slimming. I will def purchase another color tooğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


This was my second purchase. I typically wear XXL but that was too big. So I went down a size and this definitely fits better. Also, reason I purchased was the pockets I love pockets. I got this to wear with capri leggings without pockets I am lost.


Super cute and comfy dress, easy to just throw on a go about your day.  Fits a little big.  The chart says XL for my bust size but the large fit perfect and a little loose. Definitely recommend.
