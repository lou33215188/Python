Love love love it... Perfect fit, looks sexy classy, yet comfy cool.  The pockets are great.  This is a great dress up or dress down outfit.


This fits and looks exactly as pictured. Got lots of compliments in my casual workplace.


VERY COMFY.  I HAVE NOT WASHED IT YET BUT I LOVE IT AND THE FACT IT HAS POCKETS IS A PLUS


very cute cold shoulder dress.  Love the pockets.  Great flow and is very flattering.


Loved initial product. Beach cover up ... dry clean only ? SERIOUSLY ?? What a drag. Still bought more. Delicate cold wash, drip dry. Beach coverups should be completely wash and dry and impervious to chlorinated pools.


Love this dress. Very fashionable. Can be dressed up or down. Good quality material. Holds its shape and color. The navy is a true color.


I love the dress, it’s super pretty! The only problem is that it’s incredibly see through. Even wearing spandex won’t fix that because then you can see the spandex and where they end. It’s good for it’s price the only thing I’d say is to make sure you have enough money to put a slip under it so you aren’t walking around showing off your buttocks the entire day you wear this dress.


Comfy material and fit, but the “hunter green” is, in reality, a disgusting diarrhea brown color. Not going to be wearing this outside of my own home. Disappointing.


One of my husband's favorite dresses on me. It's surprisingly very flattering, and I love the pockets!


This is so comfortable. I am a plus size girl and don't always want to wear dresses. But this is the perfect in between casual and dressy that I like.
