My new favorite dress.  Fits perfect, love the feeling of the material soft, yet silky..  Hidden pockets a plus.  Girls you will love this one...


Cute. Thin material used.  Will only last one season.  Love the side pockets.  Still ordered if in another color because my daughter look great in it.


Cute, but too short


Really cute and lightweight! I wear a tank top and bike shorts underneath and it’s great!


cute dress, need more colors


very flowy, hit me about mid thigh ( I am 4'11" and 122 lbs) and I ordered a small.  The Navy is almost black, and I like that about the color.  Decent quality material for the price, and I will definitely enjoy this for summers to come


This fit as expected but was also a bit large. I'm 5'0" so I got a M and the length is right, though I may need a waist belt to give it more shape since it doesn't quite drape the way I'd hoped. Still, it's wearable.


Not really flattering unless you are a stick figure.


Material too thin. Didn’t fit as expected


I love this, but it runs large.  Good material, well made; just wish I had ordered a size down.
