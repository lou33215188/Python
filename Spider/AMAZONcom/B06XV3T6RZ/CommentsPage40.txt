Love it


Good fit.  A bit to long to wear with leggings, however this is a good length to wear as a dress.


Cute dress but runs really small.


Read the reviews and decided to go with a large. I'm 5'3" and 163lbs and it fits great. looks great too


I really like the way the dress/tunic works out for me. Wore it to a concert and it was a hit.


Fits perfectly and can be casual or dressed up. Love the pockets!


Fits as expected, cute.  I ordered the pink the fabric is too thin, darker colors would be ok.


I love this dress so much! It did great and the material is amazing!


Fit great and is very comfortable. I have to see what it looks like after one wash to see the quality of the fabric.


I ordered a large and it fit as expected. It is absolutely the most comfortable dress I own!
