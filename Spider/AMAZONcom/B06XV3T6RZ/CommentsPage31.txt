Love the color and it's got pockets. It is a bit shorter than expected but we can work with it.


Love this dress!!!! The pockets are great!!


I get compliments everywhere I go.


I wear it casually and also for fancier occasions.


I am an xl so that's what I ordered. Fits fabulously. I'm 5' and it falls just above my knee.


I'm giving it 2 stars because you can see through it.  The cut is cute though.


Easy to dress up or down, happy with the purchase.


My daughter loved it. It fits just right and is cute on.


I'm 5'4", 140 lbs and a B cup... the small fits me great!


Too long. Fits weird on my wide shoulders.


this dress is very flattering and comfortable.


Love love love. Buying a few more colors!


Cute.  Fits great.  Love having the pockets.  Ordering in a few more colors.
