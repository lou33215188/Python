comfortable, and the pockets are great


I'm very pleased with this purchase. the dress is super cute and a decent quality!


I bought the medium as I am typically a 8/10.  This was slightly big but the way it falls makes that no big deal. Lovely, light fabric and VERY flattering. Great buy!


Love this dress.... so comfortable and cute.  I ordered the black and red one as well.


Fits great, material is thin but no slip needed


So very cute and extremely comfortable. Got a compliment from someone I did not even know the first day I wore it.


Love this dress! It's very flattering and so comfortable. I bought it in black and white. The material is soft and thick and fits true to size.


Very comfy. Can be worn casual or work setting. Love the pockets.


It is see through so had to buy a slip. I'm 5'0 & 115lbs. Small fit good!
