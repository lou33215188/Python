My favorite dress, I ordered 3 more!


Soft!!!


Yet flattering!


light weight comfy, great beach wear, poolside, or running out the door, purchased 90 degree Flex Yoga shorts to wear under


prety dress ğŸ˜€


Very cute, casual dress. Extremely light weight and the pockets didn't make it fit weird at the hips. The dress is very casual - perfect for beach days.  The hem hits right at the knee.


I would wear this dress every day if I could.


Too short for a dress!  And too long for a top in my opinion!


Great price for a cute dress.


Inloke


Super cute


Could have easily gone down a whole size. Material is similar to all the thinish.. lycria, spandex and will expose every lump and bump. It is softer than say, thicker stretch material you'd find in yoga shorts.
