The dress looks just as I expected. Besides a small hole in the pocket, it is very nice material and looks casual yet cute. I am 165lbs 5 7" and a medium fit nicely.


Cute and fun


Very comfy, shorter than I expected and I'm 5'3" but it was fine. I'll definitely get a lot of wear out of this dress.


I almost sent it back as it hangs very loose.  I opted to purchase a belt to wear with it to make it look better.


LOVE IT !  LOVE IT !  LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.


Great fit.  Great dress.  Great pockets !!!!!


I love it, it looks exactly like the picture.


Cute.just as it is in the pix


Glad I read the reviews and agree that this is a great product and fit.  Perfect for hiding lumps and bumps and I normally wear a 12-14 and the L fit great.  Perfect summer dress or great over leggings.  Thinking about more colors!!


I LOOOOOOOOOVE this dress. It is so soft, fits beautifully, and HAS POCKETS.  I'm definitely going to buy it in another color. (Or two, or three, or four...)


I am 5'0", and a 36DD, and it hits right above my knees.


The dress is a little bit on the thinner side like a t-shirt but I love it! It is comfy, cute, appropriate length. I'm 5'4" and 125lb and a small fit perfectly
