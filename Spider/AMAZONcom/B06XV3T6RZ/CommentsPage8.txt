This is officially my buffet dress. It was less flattering than I hoped, and I look a bit like I'm wearing a tent, but it's great for concealing the aftermath of a big meal! I love the bright red colour, which turned out pretty true to what you see in the photo.


I'm 5' 4", approx 140lb, and medium fit me fine.


LOVE THIS DRESS!!! I first bought a medium and had to return for a small. I usually wear a M-L. I am 5'4" and the small fit me perfectly. It is so comfy and can be dressed up or down. Love the pockets too.


This dress is super cute and a lovely gray color. It was a little bit large/more flowly than I expected, but I kept it because it was such a great dress. The pockets were amazing to have - pockets are the best!. The open shoulder is super cute and fell really well on my shoulders.


This dress is really big.  The material is thick, doesn't seem cheap, but I wear an xtra large and that's what I ordered.  It's huge on me.


I will have to return it now.


I did not receive this dress. The one I got was not cold shoulder like it says, but just a simple tank top dress. It is a nice material, but since it isn't the one I ordered I can only give this product 1 star.


This dress is super cute. I love the comfortable cut. However, I wish they had a smaller option. I would buy more colors if they carried an xs. The small is pretty large on me, and I will have to hem it, as it sits well below the knee. To me, itâ€™s not worth it to buy something Iâ€™ll have to fix. I recommend it if youâ€™re taller (Iâ€™m 5â€™0â€�). Or if youâ€™re short and like dresses to be the most awkward length ever. The material is very thin, so definitely great for hot weather. Once I hem it, itâ€™ll be a great piece.


So cute and comfy! I got a M and I'm 148 pounds and 5'5. Fits great and it makes me feel good wearing it. It's very flattering but just know the material is pretty thin.


Purchased this to wear on our first cruise.  It fits cute but it stays terribly wrinkled all the time.  Even after ironing it wrinkled right back up to the point of not really being wearable.  Not sure how much use it will be if it has to be ironed and wrinkles anyway...


I absolutely love the blouses and dresses I have bought off the site Amazon ! Some of them didn't fit so I had to return them which I feel bad , but the ones that did fit and worked out feel luxurious and I love them and I will continue to buy what I've been buying that fit properly. Thank you Amazon ğŸ™‹


Iâ€™m absolutely in love with this dress! Usually I buy straight dresses but this shift dress is perfect. Iâ€™m 5â€™8â€™ 185lbs, I ordered the large which fits perfectly. Nice, thick, soft material....very good quality. Great purchase!!!
