It was very big yet short.


Great price and fit.  Always skeptical to order clothes online but I really was happy with this purchase .


I'm 5'11 and it works great for a shirt but if your anything over 5'5 and looking for a dress this is not the one to buy. It's very very short!!


Very thin


Super cute on!!


Cute and comfortable!

Dress is too flow-y, the large is HUGE, haven't worn it out yet, would probably look great with a thin or thicker belt. Go down in a size or 2 if possible.


So comfortable and I get a compliment on it every time I wear it!


Very comfortable and made of quality materials, but much longer than what's depicted in the images and ad. I bought to wear with leggings, but it is quite long. I'm 5'2" and it is well below my knees (nearly mid calf). I'll still be keeping because of the comfort and it's soft fabric, but if you aren't 6ft tall and don't want a midi length, this is not for you.
