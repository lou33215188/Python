Couldn't be happier,  I went back and ordered a 2nd one.  XL hangs just right and im 25 lbs over for mynheight, plus it isn't too shortv which isboften a problem for tall women,  no belly shows or pantylines!  Can't get over how soft and goodvqualitu for the price!


LOVE this dress and I always get compliments when I wear it!  So comfortable and looks dressier on than I expected which was a pleasant surprise.


Love this dress! Great for travel. I will be buying more in different colors.


Cute dress. I am short and overweight, so the fit makes me look a bit chunkier, but that isn't the fault of the dress


I am 5â€™4, 130lbs - fits loosely on me just how I like it.


so comfy, loved the pockets, was a little shorter then I thought.


Cute and comfy dress. I ordered a large because I have a 36G bust and it fits perfectly and does not look like a tent which is the case for me with most swing style dresses.


I never leave reviews but decided to do so for this cute dress.. I'm 5'5 160 and I normally wear a 12 in dresses. Orded a lg. It was big on me. But loved the color and style so I decided to get a wide tan belt to make it work. Hope this helps some of you ladies out there. ( I carry most of my weight in my belly area).


I didn't really care for the way that it fit but I will use it to wear around the house.


The color is exactly what you see. I really do like it, but I would agree with everyone else that sizing runs a little large. But I use a belt with it and it looks great! I ordered a small and I'd say it fits like a medium. Need to work out so my arms fit better too. ;)
