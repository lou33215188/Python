Love this, but short for the taller person, wear as top


This thing has pockets. Looks great with a stretch belt. One of my new favorite summer dresses


I'm a bigger gal. I went by the comments and sizing and the dress fits perfect. Loose and flowing not too tight on belly.


Nice fit and vibrant color. Lots of compliments


This dress is amazing in every single way. Good-looking? Check. Bold color? Check. Comfortable? Check. AND IT HAS POCKETS, THANK JESUS ALMIGHTY!


It's my favorite dress now, I'll probably be buying it in other colors.


I love this dress! Comfortable flows loose and sizing is true to fit! I am fuller in busy and wear a medium, and it fits great and I received so many compliments on it!


Fits perfect and looks great! Perfect for casual as well as dress up. I'm 5'6"" and 135lbs and ordered a medium. Perfect!


Looks like crap. If you aren't a super skinny model, it will make you look like a cow!


LOVED this dress so much I ordered it in other colors!!...Fit as expected, nice and airy and comfortable for our Texas heat!...thx


Cute dress & fits good.  The quality is pretty decent.  I'm happy with my purchase.
