Absolutely loved this dress! I tried it on quickly and wore it out to our Anniversary dinner! I bought a different color of the same dress because it's so comfortable and it is very attractive on.


Structure is lost a bit after washing, but the dress is comfortable and fits as expected. Gorgeous blue and pink colors.


This dress looks great on me.  I am on the chubby side and this dress hides the chubby stomach I have!  It is slenderizing and a really  cute dress.  It does wrinkle after washing, though.


Adorable and comfortable dress. A hole in one of the pockets; not sewn properly. Nothing that a needle and thread cannot fix, but I would prefer not to have to 'work' on a brand new clothes.


Love this!  It is so cute on and fits perfectly.  Very comfortable.  But after first wash, there is a small pinhole in fabric right in the top front.  :(


Cute fit and surprisingly nice fabric.  Will be great summer and vacation dress.  Ordered small (5'4" at 120 lbs)


I received many compliments and it fit very well. I have washed it (cold water, hang dry) and held up great. I love the material and the pockets are an added bonus too. I will be ordering other colors.


Material was thinner than expected, but not too thin. Dress is not see through. I would recommend wearing something underneath it on a windy day :)


True to size. Nice material.


Amazing dress, I used it for beach play this summer and was not disappointed. Great fit I ordered xl, and it fit me loosly as I wanted it to.
