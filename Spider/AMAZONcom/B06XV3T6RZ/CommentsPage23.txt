Wore this with white capri leggings. I have received many compliments!


Very cute. It was a little short for me. Washes well. Color is great for LSU football.


Is a big fit but, nice


very large around the waist. I look rediculous in it


Cute and cool, goes nicely over tights,


did  not care for how it fit


This is a very cute and comfortable dress. I actually wore it as a swim cover-up in Jamaica. I received compliments on it. I would love it in other colors.
