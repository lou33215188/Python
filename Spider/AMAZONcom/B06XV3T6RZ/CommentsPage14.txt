I probably never give 5 star ratings because that would mean it's perfect and what is, right?! Well I absolutely love the fit and feel of the dress. I purchased a large in the black. I normally wear a large so order your size. I'm 5'9 curvy and a 40DD. it falls about mid thigh as expected and lays right in the chest area. I've never been more pleased with a online garment purchase. Seriously! I'm considering buying other colors just because I'm so pleased. I only tried it on but I can't wait to wear it out.  When I do, I'll post photos.  If you don't have a "Sharply" shape, I wouldn't suggest this is for you. IJS


FYI-I didn't receive a dime or discount for my review.


I love this but the pockets were not sewn up?  I'll have to run it through my sewing machine.  Both pockets were not sewn at the bottom.  Other than that I like it.


Love it! Material feels like quality. I havenâ€™t washed it yet but it fits great and is flattering.


I love this dress so much. I gained some weight, and it hides everything perfectly. It's super soft and comfortable as well. I bought it for a cruise I'm going on, in a couple weeks. I liked it so much, that I even bought another color. Sizing was accurate as well.


The color is beautiful it fits true to size. I'm 5'5; 170lbs. I purchased a medium. I workout 5 days a week and this dress enhances my curves. ğŸ˜Š


Four stars because it has those little balls around the pit area after just a couple of delicate washes. But the fit is great and I actually feel pretty. I do wear shorts underneath


It was a little clingy in the back as it flowed nicely in the front. And a tad on the see-through side. Probably due to the light color of the dress(beige). These are the only reasons why I returned it. All in all, a great summer dress.


Big disappointment! It fitted as expected, the color was pretty close to what you see on the pictures (I ordered the yellow one), however, the fabric is completely see through. It could only be used as a bathing suit cover-up. I am sending it back. Maybe in a darker color it could work better.


LOVE IT! the fit is perfect. I'm 5'5 150lbs. Material is great. Definitely ordering again.


I love the pockets and the fit but mine was too large on me. I recommend sizing down. Usually the shoulder width is important when I buy dresses but since this is a very loose fabric and cold shoulder style, you can easily size down. Very comfortable otherwise.
