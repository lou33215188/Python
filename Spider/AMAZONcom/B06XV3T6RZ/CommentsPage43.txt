Excellent fit. Nice quality for the price. Great deal. I'll certainly get some wear from this dress. Casual weekends and maybe travel with leggings.


i love it.


Perfect


Fits perfect. Love it.


I like this dress a lot, but it is sort of shapeless on me. That is easily fixed with a nice wide belt. Very cute and versatile for fu nights out or church or school.


Very cute for a casual dress. A little shorter than I expected. I'm 5'7". Tee shirt type material so pretty thin but flows nicely.


Love this dress, got it in black. The fit was perfect, wasnt tooo short. The material is good too, not too thin, didnt need to wear anything under it, very nice and casual dress.


Color is great but fabric is thin and see through on yellow colored dress :(


I love it. Fit me good and fabric was soft. There was a bit of thread loose so I worry about how it might hold up in long run but not enough to stop me from buying it in a few more colors.


Cute and true to size
