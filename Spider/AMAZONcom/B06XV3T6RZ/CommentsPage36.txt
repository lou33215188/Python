Super cute, want one in every color. Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a little short on me (I'm 5'10). I'll probably mostly wear it with leggings underneath.


It fir as expected and looked like it cost more than what I paid for it.


I am curvy 5'5" and the large fit perfectly! Long enough for a casual summer work outfit. Comfy enough for 100+ so cal summer weather. Considering more in different colors.


Cute and easy to wear!


Comfortable


Love Love LOVE...super comfortable.  will look cute in the spring/summer but wore with leggings and flats the other day to work! Love it


Simple and fun. The cold shoulder look gives it just enough dressiness when paired with cute shoes.


Fit perfectly


Love it, Love it. Thank you AMAZON


Wears very comfortably
