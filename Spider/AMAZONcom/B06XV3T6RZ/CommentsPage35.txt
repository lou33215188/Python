Pretty but really short


This dress is elegant. I can easily wear it to work and then transition it to an evening outfit with a change of shoes. It is more flowy than I anticipated but I enjoy that and I love the pockets. Would buy again in black or in another color.


Fit as expected and cute.


I'm 5'5" 170 lbs 54 yo woman that said love the color and the fit but it's a little short but I do like the fit of the dress


I have not worn this yet.  Bought it because I needed some summer dresses during my recovery with a huge leg brace that I will be wearing for several months.  The fit is great, seems comfy.  I got all that just trying it on.


Returned. Flimsy jersey.


This dress is perfection! I love the cut, the fit, the material, everything! I definitely will purchase more colors. I can't recall what size I ordered but I wear an 18/20 and it fits very flatteringly.


Love everything about this dress!! Great product for the price. Comfortable. Looks great. I want one in every color!  Love having pockets. Easily dressed up or down.


Love this dress.


Great dress, Throw in wash, hang, wear.
