Love this dress very loose fitting. Great material & color is beautiful. Fits as expected


So soft and lightweight! I wish it was a little longer, but otherwise love  it! True to size, Iâ€™d say


This blouse is stylish and pretty and fits as expected. The material is soft and slightly dressy. I love it.


Love, love, love this dress. Light weight, long enough. My daughter is 5'9" and this fit right at her thighs perfectly. I'm 5'2" and it goes to above my knee. Great flowing look. 2 long pockets on the side. Bought 4 of these dresses in different colors.


Love this dress! It is very flattering and a great quality for the price. Perfect for day or you can dress up for night. I'm 5'2" and the length was a little short in the back.


Pretty color but peek a boo opening on shoulder not a good fit.


My wife loves it.  I really like it on her.  The small fits her well, as a size 4/6.  Bought a brown one, too.


I love this dress! Even received a complement from the security lady at the airport when she checked my pockets, LOL


It is very soft and light weight.  Might order another in different color..


Just OK. Don't know what the reviews were reving about...nothing spectacular. Maybe I expected more based on the reviews.


Super comfortable, a bit large in the body area.  Not see through.
