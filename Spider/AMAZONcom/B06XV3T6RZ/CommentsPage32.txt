I absolutely love this dress. I get compliments on it all of the time, it's the perfect shade of blue, and it goes with so many cardigan options for work. I bought the black one, too.


cute


Once washed its soooo short especially if u got a lotta booty. So so short long shirt now


These cold shoulder dresses show just the right amount of skin for an older woman.


To pleased with this dress. Super cute and comfortable. Material is a soft stretch material. I am 5'2 and it's just the right length! Most dress I worry will be to long or to short depending on size! This may be my new little black dress!!!


Love it. Soft comfortable and I get compliments on it every time I wear it out.
