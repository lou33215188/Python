so comfy and cute with  pockets best dress ever!!


I got the pink and it is true to the color shown. I ordered it as it was supposedly 95% cotten but does not feel like it? The dress does not really have a shape but it will work for me as an extra just on case summer dress.


Love love love these dresses! I bought a second one and all my friends wanted the link to this dress so they could buy one! Fits perfectly, it's very comfortable and I love the pockets!


Very pretty purple, but too clingy for my figure.


It bells out quite a bit. I like it.  It's comfortable and has pockets.


LOVE THIS DRESS!!!


comfy dress to wear around the house that's about it.  pockets are handy


Great summer or weekend dress. Great fit and quality for the price.


This dress is paper thin, and just as sheer. Be careful what you wear it with, because even though it isn't clingy, it still leaves nothing to the imagination


Very casual dress, nice to throw on and look good while being very comfortable. Great value. Wonderful summer fun dress.
