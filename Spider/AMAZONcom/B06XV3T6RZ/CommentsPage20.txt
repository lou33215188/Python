I bought XL it fits perfect. Material is a bit thin but perfect in black. Looks great on very flattering.


Looked like a feedbag, it was returned.


A little looser and shorter than I expected, but I still really like it


I absolutely loved the fit of this dress, I have a bit of a pouch and this dress falls so nicely so as to mask it! Wish I had gotten another colour. Packaged very nicely as well and good material.


Looks better in the picture - bit flimsy in real life, but I will keep it as an everyday dress.


The fit was perfect! It was comfortable and light. I am 5'2 so it was a little longer on me than the model in the picture but for me the length was perfect. I just ordered two others in different colors. It is my go to dress and will definitely carry into fall.


LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress!!  I thought I was buying a long top but it is long enough to wear as a dress. Comfortable, cool and VERY stylish. I may have to buy more colors!


This is a very cute tshirt dress!  The cut is very flattering and it can be dressed up or down.  The shoulder straps easily hide bra straps and the pockets are deep enough to be functional.  The dress is lightweight enough that it is great in hot weather, but not thin enough to be see through.  I am generally in a 16 but large chested and the XL fit perfectly and isn't tight across the chest at all.  My only negative is minor - thematerial isn't as soft as some of the recent tshirt dresses I have purchased, but it isn't bad.  It is a very standard tshirt material.


The design is nice with the off the shoulders and pockets. The dress fit perfect on top, however began to puff out where the pockets were on my hips, making me look larger.


Love this dress!  Fit perfectly and love the color!
