Fit as expected ND was the perfect length. Purchased  Granddaughters date.


I reach for this all the time.  It's flattering, fits true to size, washes well, is soft, and appropriate for work, the beach or a night out depending on how you accessorize.  I will be ordering in more colors!


In this I looked like a big yellow blimp. No thank you!


I bought the army green dress and when I opened it I thought they actually sent me the wrong color because it's pretty much just brown. The only other color similar is the coffee and it's definitely not the coffe because it's not a super dark brown. Not a fan of the color but it's still a cute dress.


it loses its shape


Good
