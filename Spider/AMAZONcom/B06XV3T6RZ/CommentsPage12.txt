This is a very comfortable dress; I received several compliments the first time I wore it. The left pocket has a gap where it wasn't sewn all the way around. No worries, I'll just stitch it up. Not enough to send it back.


This dress is very comfortable. It is perfect for beach or resort wear. You can wear it as a dress but it is also perfect as a coverup over a swimsuit.


Love this dress! I ordered the Large based on other reviews. I am 5'5'', 140 lbs, and usually wear an 8 in most clothing. Fits perfect and length is just to the top of my knees. I should consider purchasing more.


Cute and versatile


Great fit, great price and great material.  Great, great, great buy!!!  Yes, finally a dress from another country that actually fits...Thanks


MADE IN CHINA, SIZING WAY TOO SMALL. IS NOT COTTON. FEELS MORE LIKE CLINGY RAYON. I AM 5'1" AND IT CAME 2" ABOVE MY KNEE. RETURNING.


order two sizes larger than what you normally wear and you should be fine. Other than that, thiis is a super soft and cute top and the pockets are doubly awesome. I'm going to buy more colors. they pair great with pencil skirts, leggings, capris, jeans.


This is cure dress. Its fun for spring.summer. I could have went with a smaller size but will see how it washes. The color is vibrant orange


I love these dresses , they fit great an you can wear them layered or alone . The pockets are awesome . I wore these to work at a hospital.


It was too large and it didn't look like the photo
