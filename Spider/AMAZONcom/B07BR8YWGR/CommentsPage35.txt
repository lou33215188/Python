The dress is beautiful. I have received many compliments wearing it. The material is better than what I thought it would be. I am really happy I chose this dress.


Very comfortable, simple, and elegant


It looks okay depending on what you need it for.  However, it is too long (I'm 5'2") and not very flattering (I'm 120lbs).


Took the advice based on the reviews and bought a larger size than I'd normally wear (I usually wear 8-10 or medium). It bugs just right. Have it a 4 because it chest area is a bit big.


The fabric quality is not the highest, but the dress fits well.


Loved this dress fits me like a glove in all the right places


Nice but had to return as it was way too small.


Got so many compliments!!


I ordered a size up to be safe and it was too small. Material looks and feels very cheap.


Fits very well. Nice material and looks amazing.
