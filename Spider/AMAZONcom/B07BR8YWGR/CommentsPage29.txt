I got the medium, expecting, I guess, a skirt that fell straighter.  It fit everywhere except through the hips--I felt like Jessica Rabbit!  Which is not a bad thing, just keep it in mind.


I ordered the white dress! It's super cute! The material is not too thin! Really good buy!! Helps u hide the tummy and makes your body look perfect!


Quality of dress was so cheap. I didn't even wear it. It was torn at the seems. It was not what was in the picture. This has been the second time I get a dress that is poor quality


Very poor quality! I sent it back! You get what you pay for! Thin!


So many compliments on this! Great dress for the price!


This dress fit like a glove! Had to hem it a few inches because I am super short though(4' 11")


Tight fitting, but comfy and pretty


Great dress!


I Love it! This dress is Super cute, and fits perfect! I ordered a medium I'm 5,5, 140ish a bit curvy and it fits like a glove.


lovely dress
