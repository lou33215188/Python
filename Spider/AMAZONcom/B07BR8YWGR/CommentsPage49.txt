Great Dress !! In Love with it !! Totally Recommend to anyone!!


This dress was very nice, I received compliments all night. The only


problem  I had was that the bust area was a little  too big. Overall very flattering, for the price a good deal.


I love this dress ! It's somewhat large to me (166cm 120 pounds, size: small). But it doesn't matter.


The dress came in a timely manner.  The one things I was worried about was the material being cheap and thin . The material  on this dress is of quality.


LOVED this dress!! The quality isn't bad and I felt great it in!


The first dress I purchased was a large, but the tag said XL. The dress also had animal fur all over it, and deodorant stains in the armpit area.


I sent the first dress back and reordered it. I received the second dress. The sleeves are big, and they don't stay up. There is also this weird defect in the breast area where one side is slightly higher then the other (its enough to notice something is off while wearing).  Its a nice dress, but after ordering the same twice and being disappointed both times, its time to move on.


are swindlers! deceivers! Do not buy this dress just want to take your money


This dress was too small can I have an other dress size xx-lg


The arms were a little small ... This dress not good for women with double DDs but other then that looks classy . I had to return because of I got a bigger size it would be loose around the waist area


Dress is beautiful..the fit compliments my assets and hides the imperfections.i have yet to be dissapointed with any dress i have bought from amazon. My event is in two weeks. I cant wait..thanks!!!!
