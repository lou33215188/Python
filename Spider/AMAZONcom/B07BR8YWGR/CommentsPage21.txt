I really loved this dress. I am 5'9 195lbs. I wore a high hell and the dress was a great length. If your stomach is a problem area, it hides that area. If you have big breast beware if you do not like showing them, this dress emphasized my 38 Ds but I loved it.


Omg is gorgeous I love it fits perfect got a large size but dress tag says xl not sure why but I am 5'6 and 178 and size Large fits perfect


This dress fit so well! The material is thicker than I expected thankfully! I was afraid that since it is form fitting it would be thin material. The arms of the dress stay up better than I thought from other reviews. The length is good (I am 5'10). The peplum covers my tummy to my waist and is very flattering! I can't wait to match some pearls with it and wear it to a military ball in a month! The packaging is very small and will fit perfectly in my luggage!


I love this dress, I am a size 10/12, 170lbs 5'6.5".  I have a small waist with thicker thighs.  This dress was long like I like it ( over my shoes).


sexy sexy sexy.


I had to return it since it was slightly larger on me. No Extra smalls with this seller ):


Awesome! I was kind of scared because i didn't have time enough to return it in case it wouldn't fit me but the dress fits me perfect!! Shipping was fast, i'm so happy!!


Love this dress!! I cannot wait to wear it to an event and gloat on the cost ğŸ˜€


The fit on my body is so great! It's comfortable & sexy. I did expect the length to be too long, i got a small size and i'm 5'1. But it's the fit of on the breast area thar i have to figure out how to fix. I'm only 34B & it looks like this dress is designed for the gifted ones.


I wore this dress for a wedding and I loved it. I wear a 2 or a 4 in jeans and ordered a small and I feel like I still had some extra room and would have been able to wear an extra small. The dress is very flattering and the material fits great. I'm 5'3 and even with heels on, the dress was a bit long. Bc of the material the dress is made from, it is easy to adjust the length by a simple pull and tuck around the waist area. This is a timeless dress that I cant wait to wear again.


Love this dress! It's exactly as pictured and surprisingly the fabric is great not too thin ... Figure flattering and comfortable and the peplum design hides problem areas... I will probably replace the zipper its a little flimsy but over all for the price you can't beat it!
