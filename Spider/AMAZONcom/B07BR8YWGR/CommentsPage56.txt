Perfect dress I wore to a wedding, fit nicely and complements your curves in a classic way


I was not expecting the quality of product I received. The fabric is thick, stretchy and not see through, but not too heavy. I didn't notice any missing stiches that others me mentioned. I'm about 155lbs, 5'4"ish and have 38D boobs and the large hugged everything perfectly and was just about the right length. I LOVE THIS DRESS!


It is a beautiful dress but a little bit too small :( wish they would have XL .


Very disappointed, too small not true to size, Poor quality


very sexy!! love it


Love this dress. Can't beat it for the price.


Perfect fit...good quality material...absolutely in love with it!!!


Beautiful,simple,black,sexy :D


i'm 5'4, 129 lbs,and it fit perfect!


This dress is fabulous!


Loved it. Sleeves were a little loose in the arms. But material was stretchy. Would have loved it in other colors.
