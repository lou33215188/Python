The fabric looked cheap and did not look like it appeared in the picture


Perfect quality! Perfect fit! Perfect delivery time!


This dress is perfect! I'm 5'10 and a size 2-4. I ordered the small. It's long enough for me to wear with heels! Great purchase


This dress is not only beautiful but it fit amazingly!


Great dress. The dress does run a size smaller. Returned it, and rebuying the dress a size up.


So I bought this dress 2 days before the wedding I had to attend and surprisingly it fit PERFECTLY! The material was cheap, but I really didn't expect too much from the material considering the price. It was extremely flattering.


The dress is very pretty  looks great n very flattering loved it. Just one thing I'm a 36C n it's  a little big in the chest area.


too small


Seemed nicely made, fit really well  but it was too short. I needed it for an event that was the night it arrived so I returned it. I am 5' 9", Size 36DD chest, and 170 lbs.


When I received the dress there were parts of it that were sewn incorrectly and extra strings hanging from seems but after some twerking on those issues it looked great. Served its purpose for the price. I did hem the length as well.
