Fits great!!!


not good.


Could not be happier with this dress! It came super fast and fits like a glove! Nice thick material. I think I may have to order more colors!


I am a size 10/12 I ordered the medium and large...they were tiny.


It was perfect!


This was a great dress for the price. It fit very well. I'm giving it 4 stars just because it had a little tear in the seam by the zipper, but it wasn't anything a little handstich couldn't fix.


Loved the dress and everyone at the wedding I attended loved seeing it on meğŸ˜‰


Got the large, if you're bigger than a size 10 or 12 it won't fit cause it runs a little small especially in the sleeves around the arms but I'm a size 10 and fit into it perfectly fit, beautiful dress


Dress was floor length. Nice quality material.


Large was not a large. Very disappointed.
