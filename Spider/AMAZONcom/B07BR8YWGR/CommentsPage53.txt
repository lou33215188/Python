Really pretty dress. It is stretchy and very comfortable. The only down side is that the sleeves don't stay put :/


I think I got a large and I am a C cup and in that area it was a little loose but everything else was perfect. It's elgant  and sexy


Dress fit beautifully.


Fit perfect. Everyone loved it.


Beautiful dress


Made small but fit perfect


Had to return for a larger size. The material is worth the money


Fts in all areas but the arm was too small.


dress is really comfortable and fits as expected.. i am on the shorter side so i have to get it altered but very happy with this purchase!!


This dress is beautiful. I'm  5'0", 130 lb. I ordered size medium and it fits me perfectly. I had to trim the bottom.
