Absolutely great dress, at a great price. This was true to size. I am about a 10 and got a large. Perfect fit. Does have some stretch which helps to hug curves. The Peblum helps hide common problem area too.


Fit fabulous, color as seen and doesn't look as cheap as it cost. The bust area was a little loose, but you can't beat the price and quickness of delivery.


This item is classy and sexy everyone's heads kept turning fantastic !!!!


Just perfect! I order this dress just 3 days before an event, I did next day delivery and received it less than 24 hours later. Before ordering I read lots of reviews and q&a. I'm 5'4 155lbs size 10, 34dd the large fit me perfect. For the price and a one time use it's well worth it!


Oh  my gosh!! I read the reviews and thought I would give this dress a try. WOW!! I can't wait to wear it in a couple of weeks. This dress hugs in all the right places.


The fabric wasn't what I expected. It was very tight and hard to move in. Came on time and package wasn't damaged.


Beautiful dress. SO amazing for the price. So flattering


Great Dress for the occasion but it fits small. I order the medium as it states medium is size 8-10. Well the dress is beautiful but it a medium does not fit a size 10. Im 5"4 and the length was perfect as it didn't drag the floor with my 3" heels. I wore this to a black attire event and I received many complaints all night.


The material is awful. Returned


I ordered this dress for a ball that I am attending and when I tried it on it fit like a glove. It hides problem areas with the midsection if you have them and fit exactly as I expected. I got a medium, I'm only 5'2"/5'3" so it is an inch or so long with heels but nothing an alteration can't fix! Happily surprised with this dress, especially with the price--would order it again!
