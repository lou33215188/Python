In love with dress I would  buy it again , I order a M . I'm 5'1ft 122 lbs 36 c and it fit amazing  on my body I think this dress would fit anyone because its a strech material ....


Got this dress today for a wedding I have next weekend, I tried it on and absolutely love it!! The material is perfect and super comfy. I'm 5' 6" and about 135 lbs and the medium fit perfect, it hugged every curve just right! Can't wait to wear it.


For taller people 5'7 and higher.


Wore this to a black tie gala and got many compliments. Fits very well. Fabric is a bit thin but can't beat the price!


I was pleasantly surprised at the material of this dress. It was thicker than expected & it had some stretch to it. It was sexy & still classy. I would given it 5 stars but it was extremely long. I hemmed it & then it was perfection ğŸ˜‰


Returned it for a refund


This dress is absolutely amazing.  I loved how it fit me and received many compliments!  The dress was a little big on the top.  I purchased a medium and could've gotten away wearing a small.  This dress hugs all your curves.  I wore Spanx stockings for an all over smooth look.  I did not want to take this dress off!!


Wore this for a few dances. Everyone thought it was a very expensive dress too.


The dress fell apart and I couldn't get a refund.  Don't purchase it.  The fabric is poor


The bottom of the dress fit perfectly, it was really elegant and pretty. The arms fit really weird though.  I bought a size up which fit me perfectly in the body...but made the top fit in a funky way.
