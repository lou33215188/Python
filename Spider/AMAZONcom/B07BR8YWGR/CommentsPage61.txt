OMG I am so in love with this dress and the fit. You also cant beat the price!! The material is thick and it hugs you in all the right places it it a beautiful dress.  I cant wait to wear it to a wedding im going to.  Looking fwd to finding excuses to dress up and wear it again.  The length is perfect as well and im 5'7 so i was worrried about that but its perfect ill be wearing a low heel and that should be good enough to keep it from dragging.


I've been reading those reviews with ppl that is 5'4 and 170 lbs with wide hips.... how can they get it in??? That was me.. I purchased in L omg!!!! It was super tight and small u can't even wear bras or anything.... if your an L go up a size or two believe me! For more room and breathable haha


Much too small. Will return. Disappointed. Purhcased as a bridesmaid dress and now need to go back to the â€œdrawing boardâ€�


Great fit. I also have it in another color.


Actually is a lovely dress. Material isn't all that $$ but it's thick to hide undergarments, hugs body w/o digging in, very flattering. I'm very very happy with my purchase and for the price it can't be beat! I'll order more from this seller/brand for sure.


Love love love this dress fit perfectly wish peplum was about and inch or two longer this dress will break necksğŸ’œğŸ’œğŸ’œ


Sexy gown!


Loved this dress. It does run small so order a size up. I am 5'8" size 12. I ordered a large and it hugged every curve. Perfect length to wear heals.


Looked fantastic! It wasn't as low cut on me as it was in the picture... which was nice...and a lot classier.


Not good quality
