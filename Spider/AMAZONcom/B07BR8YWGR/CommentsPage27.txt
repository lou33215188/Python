Very flattering dress. Got lots of compliments


Very pretty, fits great.  I am not crazy about the peplum piece around the waste.  I have flat stomach, but this feature makes me look bigger.


This dress is amazing for the price. The peplum is extremely flattering. Note that it's more of a blue than a navy but it's still very nice color! The fabric isn't the most luxurious but it's not a deal-breaker. Would look good on many body types.


Shipping was great. LADIES!!!!! This dress fits like a glove. The peplum style is very stylish. It hide my little stomach pooch I am always self concise about. Hugged all my curves and did wonder for my butt. GREAT MATERIAL!!!!!!


Order this dress for a formal New Years Eve Wedding. I'm 5'5 197lb and wear between a 12-14 in dresses do to my hips and thick thighs. This dress hugged all my curves and I felt glamorous and comfortable all night.


Super duper cute!


don't know why this item received such positive reviews. Shipping was fast, but item is equivilent to a $10 clearance rack dress. Poor quality. Item returned faster than it was shipped. Don't beleive positive reviews you see about this dress. It is GARBAGE!! Hooker dress quality!!!


I love it! The dress fits my body nicely, in my opinion. It hugs the body,  the back is a little lower than I excepted it to be. The dress will be perfect for my mother's 50th birthday party next week.


Please excused the bra straps was trying it on.


Loved this dress!!! Wore it to my ball!!!
