Absolutely beautiful and an amazing price. Continuous compliments all night


I was nervous to wear this dress because it was very tight on my body, but I got so many compliments on it at the gala I wore it to. It hugged my body in all the right places and the peplum covered my post baby pouch I have. If you have a formal event you want to look super sexy for, this is the dress to wear!


Fits a little snug but still flattering. I love this dress.


It's Ok.. Cheap Looking.


gorgeous but a little tight.


Dress is perfect. Nice cut, not too short. Perfect for this wedding I'm attending


The style is great.  The top does not stay in place easily.  Maybe some glue will fix that.


Great fit & material. Was concerned might be somewhat sheer, but not at all.


Wore this weekend and received so many compliments


Out of sight!
