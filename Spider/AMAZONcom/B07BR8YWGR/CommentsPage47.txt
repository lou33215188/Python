Fited perfectly ...


I just received this dress, and I am more than impressed by it. The material is stretchy but thick, and it is beyond beautiful! I am so glad that I ordered this and it arrived in time for my husbands military ball.


On the delivery bag it says L but the dress is actually XL . Returning it assap

The dress is cute but the arms run small making it difficult for the sleeves to stay up.
