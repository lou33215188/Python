LOVE IT! Super cute!


Very lovely dress


Amazing!!!!!!! A must buy! Comfortable and many compliments!!!


This was so cute!! Fit perfectly!!


Gorgeous dress but the fabric is awful and makes it look super cheap. Also, the top part is a bit large, you have to be pretty busty or have one hell of a push up bra to fill it out!


Ordered a size up based on size chart measurements. It still fit too tight so I had to return. Dress was really pretty just sad is wasn't a good fit!


Beautiful dress....dress hugs body...fits perfect. ..I'm 6'0 and the dress still touch the floor....


Fit well. A bit long but I am only 5'0. Thick material. Not flimsy or see through.


Gorgeous! I can't wait to wear this to a wedding this weekend!


The dress is really flattering and comfy, definitely recommend!
