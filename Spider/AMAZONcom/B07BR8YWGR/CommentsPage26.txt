Great dress! Loved wearing and received so many compliments. Make sure to check the sizing chart because I am normally an 8/Medium but their chart says an 8 would be a large. I ordered a large and definitely couldn't have gone any smaller! The top was a little big but nothing Dress tape couldn't fix!


Wore this as a bridesmaids dress and it looked good. My only complain it the bottom portion of the dress kept on twisting with made the slit of centered. Good quality dress for the price.


Really pretty dress- fits like a glove. I didn't realize that the dress has a slit in the back but the seeming on the one side is a bit uneven so the slit in the back is never straight. Pretty Dress overall, very flattering. I just wish the seem job was better, good fabric though.


I love the dress, wish I would have ordered the small. There is a lot of stretch in this dress so if you're in between sized go smaller. The peplum style is very forgiving and I loved the hourglass shape this dress gave me.


I did not like the material it came in.  Looks cheaper than what I expected


I recommend this dress 100% the dress fit me as expected I'm a size M-L 5'5 weight 145lbs. I wore the dress to my parents 25th anniversary. I got many, many compliments on the dress! I love it!


Please don't listen to other reviews suggesting you buy a size up. I did and my entire bust area was awful. Needless to say i couldn't wear it.


Looks great, fits perfect and it's very comfortable.  To make it better, got it before the expected date. I would give it more stars if possible.  Very simple yet versatile for any occasion with a classic touch.


VERY Poor quality


Fit and packing


returned them all


This dress was a hit and people loved it. I had more comments and looked so elegant in this dress. For the price, I fooled everyone. Great dress, looked great, cover my mid-section as needed! Very sexy!
