Pretty dress on, but prepare to show some major chest


I have a short torso so it fall off the shoulders a lot, maybe a stitch or too would make it perfect


I am a size 6 and I believe I ordered the large, so definitely order up.  Even though the sizing was off, the dress looked wonderful.


This dress is GORGEOUS!! I ordered a large, but the tag states extra large, I returned it for 1 size smaller. I will be ordering from thus vendor again. The quality is great!!


Nice dress


looked great


Not a fan. It looked ridiculous when I put it on.


Fantastic fit! Sexy and elegant, gives you a wonderful figure!


Snug on my arms, but not a deal breaker. Overall, this is a very flattering dress. Material is a thick stretch, so it covers flaws nicely.  I am pleased with the dress considering the small amount of money I spent.


Literally tiny, couldn't even pull down the dress
