Love this dress. I am 5'9 and 178lbs and a size large fit perfectly. I did fine one small hole near the armpit of the dress, it's so small though and unnoticeable. I love this dress.


Holy Smokes!  This is one hot dress!!  Beware, all eyes will be on you all night...


I got compliment after compliment all night and am still receiving compliments from friends who saw it on FB.


Seriously an easy, comfy dress that hugs all the right curves, is sexy, but all your bits are perfectly covered.


I am 5'9" 160 lbs, althletic curvy build and the Large was a perfect fit.  Maybe a tiny bit snug, but it was better than getting the larger one altered.


I read the reviews and they said Beware of the Zipper.  Please heed that advise!  The zipper ripped right off the dress, nothing I wasn't able to fix in 10 minutes, but still.  I was able to slip the whole dress, zipped up, over my head and then wiggle it down.  I think everyone should try that method first, unless you enjoy re-sewing zippers on brand new dresses...


The material is thicker and stretchy.  I have zero complaints about this dress.  In fact, it has become a standard for which I have to live up to now...  hard task!  My wedding game was ON POINT with this one!


Buy it, you won't be disappointed!


Gorgeous dress! I am just over 5'2 and about 118 lbs and ordered the S.  Wore 4" heels and had to have the dress hemmed by about 1". The dress has a bit of stretch and is very slimming. Based on the review photos, it seems like it is flattering for many body types. I am petite, but carry my weight in my midsection. The peplum did a great job of camoflaging the area without being too obvious about it (like ruching). The sleeves were a tad bit loose on me, but fashion tape should have been able to solve that issue.


I ordered the dress on Monday and it arrived on Wednesday.


I ordered the dress for a holiday party. It was  delivered on time. I'm 5'8 and about 160. I have a tummy issue and was nervous about ordering online because I like to try things on. I ordered size large in black. I was worried that it would be tight on the arms and too big in the bust but the material is stretchy so it was ok. I did have an issue with one of the sleeves rolling down but that wasn't major ( see pic). It was a good price, it fit good and I was comfortable . I am very happy with the purchase.


Nice fit! Love it! Will be my wedding reception dress! ğŸ˜Š


So I bought this dress for black tie gala, and I got tons of compliment. People wanted to know where I got the dress from. It looked more expensive than what I paid for. The only problem is the zipper and lining of the sewing (if that makes sense) the line was kind of not too strong but the fabric is great quality. Would you again in different color. I'm 5'5 and I got the size in Large


Very flattering fit. Wore it to a wedding and got SO MANY COMPLIMENTS! It's really been difficult for me to find clothes, ESPECIALLY dresses that I feel good in since I gained weight and now have a "mom bod". I was really skeptical ordering online but took a shot because I'm short on time before the event and because it had great reviews. Well I'm glad I did, tried it on yesterday and it fit like a glove. I ordered a size up and I'm pretty glad I did. I'm a size 16/18 and I got an XXL


This was by far one of the best online purchases I've made regarding clothing. It fit like a glove, and thanks to the peplum, no spanx were needed after eating a meal. Wore this to a gala, and got more compliments than I could imagine. I felt comfortable and confident, not to mention, pretty darn  sexy. Super figure flattering on all body types. I used the sizing charts and used a measuring tape (the one for clothing) and followed the chart accordingly, and I ordered a size Medium. It fit like it was made for me. The material is really comfortable, and I ordered it in black. It looks far more expensive for the price you pay. Would recommend this to anyone, and as others' have stated, the dress is super long, so if you're short, you'd need to get it hemmed.


For reference, I am 5'4, waist is a 27/28 in pants, 34C bust, and I have wider hips and a bum. Medium was an excellent choice. Two thumbs up!!


Beautiful fits like a glove and looks expensive


I really did not like the way this dress looked on me.  The tuft at the waist fell too high and so my hips stuck out below it and looked strange.  That said, the gown seems to look great on other people in their photos, so I factored that into my rating.  I imagine this dress will be great on some body types and disappointing on others!


As others have complained, the arms were too big on me.  If I had kept the dress, I would have had to alter these.  I understand the challenge here though, because not all people have the same size arms, so I'm sure the designer is going with the average.


Overall, the quality of the dress is adequate.  Great value, but not the highest quality gown.  With some accessorizing, I think it can be made to look classy though.  If you need a cheap dress in a pinch, I think this would be a good option!
