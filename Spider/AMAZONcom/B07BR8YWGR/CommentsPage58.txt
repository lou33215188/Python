Overall nice dress. Chinsy fabric. No lining. DOES NOT FIT ACCORDING TO SIZING CHART.


It fit but not as expected!


Great sexy dress.


Fits like a glove - but not lined and seems are not great. Having the seams reinforced and going to wear either shape wear or a slip under it. It really looks fantastic on, but is a bit unfinished looking on the hanger and also since its not lined. It's also a lint magnet so I'll have to figure something out to combat that before I wear it.
