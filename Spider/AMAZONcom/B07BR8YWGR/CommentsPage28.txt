Zipper broke when trying it on. The size and style was great but I had to pay extra to replace the cheap initial zipper.


Loved the dress but it was not appropriate for a mother of the bride.  However, I would definitely wear this to another black tie affair!


Wife wore to nice dinner and looked stunning, helps that my wife is already stunning!


The dress is exactly like the picture, the material is stretchy and good and the dress fit me perfect!!!! I love it!!!! I can't wait to wear it to the partyğŸ�‰ğŸ�‰ğŸ�‰ğŸ�‰


wore this gown for a banquet lovd the fit of the dress..i have smaller bosom so that part was a little bigger than expectged but overall very comfortable


The picture doesn't show it but the quality of the material is super cheap - reminds me of Halloween costume material. Also I ordered a size medium and could barely get the dress on. I properly used the sizing chart. Runs small.


I ordered a navy and received a black dress. The fabric is a step above a Halloween costume, very cheap. The sleeves also did not stay on my arms and kept slipping down. I am disappointed since in other customer photos it looked so much better quality.


I'm 4 ft. 11 in. 116 lbs. The small fit just right on mah curves and was the exact length in terms of my height! Stretchy, thick, quality fabric!


I'm happy!


I'm 5'2 and the medium fit great on me for length and fit. The peplum did everything it needed to. I got so many compliments and never felt skinnier in my life. Worth the price!


Fit perfectly. I'm 5'6 135 and fit perfect and is perfect length with 3 inch heels. Elegant and the material is very comfortable. Will wear it again!
