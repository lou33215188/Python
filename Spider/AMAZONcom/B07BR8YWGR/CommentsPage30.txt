The material was descent quality. I ordered a medium and got a large but had no time to send it back. I was really disappointed that they didn't send the right size. It is clearly on the order. It looks nice on. I would have loved it if it had fit.


Beautiful dress, great material.  It fit a little big on the upper side, but still a great choice.  Loved it


Dress fits great but stitching could be better for the price. Looks like it can use a double stitching especially where the zipper is. It's really loose


Im normally a medium but I brought a large instead. The material is perfect and holds everything together. I have 5,3 and The only problem I have is that it's a little long , but with heels it will be okay . Buy this dress !


Very pretty, like the style just a bit to long for me, as I figured since I am a petite girl!


beautiful dress. the material is not cheap at all and cant wait to wear it to a ball. there was a few loose threads but nothing that cant be fixed with scissors. it was well worth the money!!


Cute dress, perfect length. Just a little thin on the material side.


Ok but cheaply made & very long plus no lining


I love it you got get one size bigger it may run a little bit small but otherwise i love it
