Love it. It makes my curves look better


I wore this last Saturday and a local Philadelphia celebrity wedding. I am only 5'1 so the bodice was a little big and bagged at the zipper in the back.. but I wore a shaw around my shoulders and was PERFECT.I paid my seamstress $10 to make a hem.


This fits like a glove and can be worn to the highest gala affair. The price can't be beat!!!
