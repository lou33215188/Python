I ordered for my senior prom! AMAZING!!! I got the 2x. It fit but a 3x would have been 1000x better!! For more length and arm room


I love this dress! It fits like a glove! It is elegant and sexy at the same time. The fit is form fitting, yet it is forgiving. The peplum perfectly covers that midsection problem area. The material is thick and stretchy, so it pulls you in but, stretches for comfort in sitting or dancing. This is a winner!


Pretty but not what I was looking for


HIDEOUS-cant even return it


This dress was very flattering. I got many compliments. I will say that wearing a bra under it was a challenge so opted for "petals." I had to be careful with the top when dancing, but all in all I felt beautiful in the dress and my husband loved it!


Fits very well . I got tons of compliments and canâ€™t beat the price and fast delivery


The dress was cheaply made, ill fitting (insanely long and too tight. If you do order, go up at least one size) and adjust your expectations, because you won't be thrilled.


Quick shipping and really pretty dress. I ordered small


This dress is very smal although I brought an XL it's sized as an XS.  Very poor fabric....


Looks cheap
