The dress was of poor quality not what i expected had to return it. Disappointed.


This dress is gorgeous..but it cant fit my arms..it's too tight..I took L and everything is perfect except the arms..I love it


Do not hesitate to buy this dress! I am 5'5, 140lbs and I got a M. The material is kinda stretchy, so it stretches with your body. I absolutely love it!


Nice for the Price


the dress is perfect I already use for the occasion,  it came fast, I'm 5'9 160 pounds I usually use size m but reading the other's review I decided to get a L and I was glad, i just have a baby, I'm not fat but still having the baby belly and all around, and I didn't want it too tight,  but the little skirt cover that, I even use a 2.5 heal and the dress still very long, I want to post a picture but I don't know how. or I forgot yes the arms are loose I pay $ to fix it but nothing major everything else it's fine


I love it, fit great, good quality,elegant,classic, beautiful


Better material than i expected. Nice deep red color. Got a size medium, i'm a size 6 and it fit really snug. Super excited.


Fit perfectly!


It looks really sexy when you wear it.


I love it.. ğŸ‘Œ
