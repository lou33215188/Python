This was a last minute purchase for a wedding and it was well worth it.  It did come with a few snags,  but I cut them and had no issues. My hips and shoulders are bigger than my waist,  so it was a squeeze to get on,  but was perfect after that!  I got loads of compliments throughout the night. Was a great mix of fancy,  but not too fancy for a wedding where my husband was a groomsman in a tux. Can't wait to find a reason to wear it again or lend it to a friend.


Amazing dress for the price. The cloth is a bit on the thicker side so I wouldn't recommend wearing it on hot days especially outside. Fits well and hugs you in all the right areas!


Fits nicely but very disappointed that the slit is not finished on one side of the dress. See attached picture. I now have to pull out my sewing machine to finish the seller's job or use stitch witch to keep it closed as it just flies open as I walk and the poor workmanship is very visible..

This is by far the most amazing dress!!  I wore it for a formal and it fit perfectly. The waist is hidden under the ruffle which is perfect. The fabric is soft and stretchy for a comfortable fit. I would definitely recommend!


I wanted a gown for a Gala that we had to attend. We have 3 different formal events, 3 weekends in a row. I wanted to reduce cost if possible. I looked at all the reviews and decided to try this. It was a steal at 39. I wear a 12/14 In dresses and ordered an x large. It was form fitting. My husband loved it. The only issue I had is that the straps on my arms kept needing to be adjusted.


The dress fit like a glove. Only suggestion is the zipper should be longer for easier access getting in and out of the dress.


This dress fits like a glove. It made me feel the perfect mix of sexy and conservative for a military function. I am usually a 6 - 8 and wore a large in this which was a bit too big in the arms and bust ( 34DD). I don't think anyone but I noticed though. Buy this dress!


This dress is amazing. I ordered a large. I am 5'8" , muscular with broad shoulders, and weigh 175 lbs. I have a 36D chest. Initially I ordered an extra large but that was wayyy too big. Despite my broad shoulders and violin hips (look it up it's a thing), the off the shoulder thing actually somehow made them look better and the peplum disguised my oddly shaped hips. I wore it to a military ball and got many compliments. For the price it can't be beat. Great dress! Invest in an excellent strapless bra to accompany this dress. It helps.


I ordered three same style dresses from different brands and ended up returning the other two and keeping this one. I ordered a large which fit a little snug but flattered my figure nicely. The material is very stretchy and the peplum helps hide any tummy bulges. I wore it to my brother's wedding and got so many compliments on how beautiful and elegant my dress was! I loved it. Very classy and elegant for a very affordable price. Would highly recommend this brand and style over the others.


Runs small. According to the size chart I fall into a large, I got a xl too just in case and they both are small. The material is thick with a lot of spandex. The style did NOT hide my belly as others have stated it would and that's my problem area. I'm sad because I really love it. The color is not navy but more of a royal blue which was still pretty. So my search continues. ğŸ˜�
