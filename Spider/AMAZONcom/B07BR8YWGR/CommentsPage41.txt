Dress fits perfectly. I wore this to a formal event and it was perfect. Great if you need to hide the tummy area! I am 5'6 155lbs. Very flattering on


I wore this dress for a wedding and it fit perfectly! You will not be disappointed with this purchase especially for the price.


excellent dress.


Fit as expected. Figure hugging in the right places. Sleeves a bit of an issue due to constant readjustment but overall, nice quality dress.


If you want to make some jaws drop & feel like a movie star, buy this dress. Seriously.


Not fancy at all.


I just received this dress yesterday as a Prime member and I needed to have it right away for a military ball next month. I ordered a small and it fit perfectly... I'm 5'6", about 120lbs. It really does fit like a glove, has stretch but isn't see through, and I can even go braless. I thought I heard a seam pull while bending over to put on my shoes, but I found no pulls when I took it off. The dress seems constructed well enough. I'll post pics later. It's nice for $40. Thanks Made2Envy and Amazon.


Gorgeous and fits perfectly. The dress drapes to the floor and is perfect for heels.


Great dress!!!! I'm 5'11, size 36D and a size L fit perfectly!


Dress was cute, just didn't fit, way to small in the chest couldn't zipper it closed, had to send it back to try a larger size. 5'5 140lbs 36 D, medium was way too small.
