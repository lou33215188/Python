Wore this to a formal and it was awesome! Its a little stretchy (which is good if you're like me and have curves!) which helps get it over my big hips and I got so many compliments! Will be wearing it again.


This is a nice dress & fits well other than the sleeves are very tight for some reason (I wear a size M & do not have large arms so this is strange to me). I wore this dress for engagement photos with a strand of pearls, it looked very classy in the photos.


I normally wear a size 12/14 So I ordered a Large. Dress arrived and was extremely small. Very disappointed and returned. But I was Refunded fast. lol


This dress is so beautiful I wear it to my church for a fashion show. Everyone loves it on me. It fits very nice its long and slanderise my body.. I ordered a second pair.. a must have ladies


This dress was the best addition to my closet. Love how it fit perfectly for the occasion & material was really thick.


The dress is beautiful and fits great just wish I had gotten a medium than a large, the top was too loose and get falling down , so don't go a size up, it fits as expected


Beautiful dress!!!  I love the fit, feel and look!!  Absolutely amazing!!!


Everyone loved my dress! wore it both to a Gala and Pageant! received many compliments. Very great quality for the price!


Size 14/16 The XL fit great. The peplum hid my tummy, which was great. The sleeve kept coming down but it wasn't a major issue for me.


love this dress!!!!!!!!!!got many complements on it....perfect 5 stars!!!!
