Lovely dress, but I should have bought two sizes bigger. It sizes really very small.


Great quality and fits perfectly!


Cute but had to return 12 in jeans 5.1 height. Better fit would be a XL


Absolutely loved it!  Perfect for the occasion and the price made it even better.  Also delivery time was phenomenal


Disappointing.


great fitting dress for all sizes


Waa for my daughter 16 birthday. She loved it.


like a glove


Run small got to give away.


Nice dress . I Love it .
