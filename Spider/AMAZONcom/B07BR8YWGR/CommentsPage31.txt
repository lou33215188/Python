Fits lovely. Perfect for hiding that dreaded tummy. Material is surprisingly thick and it stretches..it can take some tugging and pulling (which u might need to do because the zip stops a bit short. All in all, well worth the money plus some. Will post pictures soon. Absolutely no buyers remorse here. (5'9, 190 lbs)


Fabric is thick, so I can wear normal underwear without it showing... This dress is really flattering for my body... If it were available in another color I would ordering without second thoughts... I LOVE IT!


Way too small!  I normally wear a petite size 14 so I ordered this dress accordingly.  I am 5' tall, 165 lbs and very curvy, not fat.  Thought this dress would be perfect for an anniversary dinner I'm attending in the fall.  I was SO disappointed.  Way too small.


FITS PERFECTLY!!!!! Exactly what I needed....I was afraid bc of my back but this dress dis not fail me!!!! Excuse the picture...lol i can be goofy


This dress is amazing. Long enough that I can wear heels with it (I'm 5'6"), and hugs in all of the right places. It is a little bit smaller than expected, but still fits like a glove. My only issue was a broken zipper, but it is an easy fix for the time being. I'll have to replace the zipper at a later date though. But for what I paid, its still an amazing dress.


I got this dress for my daughter and she loves it! The first dress came with s defective zipper, but Amazon quickly sent a replacement. The dress was a nice fit. However, the material wasn't exactly formal. Altogether, the dress was a good deal for the price at such short notice.


This Beautiful dress but too large for me, i need XS for me!!!


Love this dress - my arms are a bit too snugg in them only because of my top size but it works - purchased for holiday party.


Very elegant dress for the price. Wife did complain about the shoulder straps though. They're more for looks than support.


I received many compliments!!!
