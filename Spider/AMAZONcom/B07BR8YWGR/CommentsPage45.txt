Beautiful dress but not a great quality


This dress fits and it looks good on and the material isn't thin at all


The dress was to die for!!! So super cute and fit in all of the right places. It's a stretchy, but not cheap material. Nice quality for the price...I love to sow so I'm familiar with cheap fabrics...this was not. I wish I would've ordered the XL just to have a bit of breathing room for my Spanks. lol! But it was gorgeous and I got tons of compliments...from both guys and girls. **note if you are top heavy (d-cup) like me make sure you go up a size...the zipper in my dress actually broke at the event. Luckily the lights were low and no one knew but I did. I will get the zipper fixed, probably drop about 5 pounds and it will be the perfect fit! Also, I'm 5ft 3in and about a size 10 and the dress was really long...if you are my height or shorter, be prepared to wear at least 4inch heels.


This dress is drop dead gorgeous, order a size up and you will be fine.


Very strong, odd odor.


Great dress for the price!


Perfect fit


Best dress I have found online for the price.  Makes me feel so sexy!! Can't wait to wear it for the inlaws wedding.  One thing I did do was himed the bottom of the dress.  I'm 5'2" but other than that, I'm really satisfied!


5â€™5, 135 lbs and I absolutely loved it!  Received many compliments.


I'm 5'6 and weigh 155 and a 36c chest and this dress fit like a glove!  (I ordered large) love this dress very flattering for baby belly and sexy
