zipper broke right away, but its beautiful


For the price, this dress is great. It's very form fitting, but the peplum hides any belly. The length was perfect for me but I'm 5'9. The only thing I would complain about is the arm bands. They were tight and sometimes mad my arms look like sausages. But over all, I'm super happy.


Love this dress!


Loved the way it fit on the bottom, but the top was too low and the sleeves didn't stay in place.  Could have been perfect if the top fit better.  :(


The dress fit perfectly, material is comfortable and has a little give just in case. Fit like a glove, everyone gave me compliments, and gives you a kind of old Hollywood glam feel.


I am 5'7", and DD34 cup if it helps others figure out what size they would need.


It's such an elegant look. I'm totally in love, and it's tough for me to love a dress, but this the one...


The dress arrived 5 days too late, with a BROKE LN ZIPPER and it looked unfinished. The fabric is cheap looking and I'm overall very dissapointed.


okay


Nice length, a bit small


The material felt very cheap. I ordered an XL and it fit like a medium it is not made for a build woman maybe a small person. I was very unsatisfied with this dress. I wish I didn't  but this dress.
