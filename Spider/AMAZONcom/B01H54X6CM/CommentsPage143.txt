The material is amazing


It was too tight for me


I like the dress. Only thing that needs improving is the lining around the neck folds up.  Dress is form fitting and pretty. I got the green.


I loved how the dress was comfortable and stretchy!!


Color was a bit darker in person but the fit and material were lovely.


Love it


I love the way this dress fits. It definitely define your curve.


Dresses were almost true to size. Good quality and fast delivery of the dresses.


Runs a little small and didnâ€™t like the material.


My wife is 5'8 and this fitted like she was wearing a tank top.
