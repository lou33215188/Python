I loved this dress soo much. Be sure to order your correct size in it. True to size. I got so many compliments on it!!


Dress is great for business wear and the colors are vibrant. Ordered purple and burgundy. If you are voluptuous as I am, be considerate if size. I normally wear a 12 in US but I ordered a XL and it was form fitting.  I also need to lay off the sweets. Lol. The only thing I detested was the flap on the front DID NOT stay down when sitting, even though it was ironed. The right shoulder consistently fell down as well.


I wore this dress to my dance studio's ballet and received so many compliments. People were still talking about it days later. This dress fit perfectly, like a glove! I am 5'5" 115 lbs and bought a small. It cups my curves (what little I have) and the yellow color is so vibrant! It stands out in a great way. Perfect for special occasions, weddings, cocktail parties or even work. It's my new favorite dress!


I ordered this dress in the light blue and the yellow and while they were both nice dresses (in beautiful, vibrant colors), there were a few issues. The first being that the material of the yellow dress was very thin and see through. You could see the color of my undergarments right through the dress. That can be remedied with a good nude colored slip, so I still give the dress 4 stars. I ordered both dresses in a small after reading the size chart (I'm 5'9" 127 pounds, 34-25-36) and they fit quite differently. The yellow dress was a bit roomier, allowing the dress to hug my curves without being too tight. The blue dress was much more body hugging to the point that you lost the lined details through the middle of the dress and it bunched at the zipper. The material was thicker than the yellow dress, so there was no problems with being see through. I wish that I could get the fit of the yellow dress made out of the material of the light blue dress. That would be perfect. As it stands now, I'm deciding which dress I'm going to keep to wear to my event.


The dress was just a little big. I didn't want to take the chance by ordering my true size so I went a size up and ordered a 2x. Because the dress has tha amazing bodycon stretch I didn't have to get it altered. I chose pearls as my accessory because of the occasion and it was perfect. You won't regret this purchase.


This dress was a perfect fit. But i advice you to go one size up than what you wear. I got so many complement on this dress. I like it so much i purchase the navy blue like it. ğŸ‘�ğŸ˜�


This dress gave me life!! I am 5''8  211lbs I ordered an XL and was perfect for my need! I will order again from this company.. I wore this to an fundraising event and received many compliments!


This Dress was a big hit.  It fits very well.  Shows your curves.  But the gathering in the front hides small imperfections.  I ordered yellow and it is actually a beautifully bright yellow.  I got tons of compliments and heard the words sexy and classy all night long.  I am 5'2 and 124 pounds, I ordered the small.  Highly recommended.


Gathered material at waist is LIFE!


The measurements in the product description  are off so I went a size up from my normal XL to XXL and the dress was a perfect fit; I'm 5'2 hips 47", waist 39" and breast at 39 "217lbs


The dress looks beautiful online. In person, the material is somewhat see through (should have had a lining). Also, the dress was extremely long. Not what I expected, based from the picture online. Nice color though.
