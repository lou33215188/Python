The material is by the best. It's not flimsy, not nessarily the flattering sheath material either. If you can stand the noise of paper rubbing together you'll probably be ok


I purchased the dress in green as a medium and I loved the fit! I usually wear a size 10 dress, only issue was it would ride up a little, perhaps I should have ordered a large... ğŸ˜…


Size runs small.  Ordered large.  I am ordering again, one size up.


Love it so much!


Sexy for working in or for a night out. Great product


My fiancee wore this dress for our engagement photo shoot and it fit her well. Love this dress on her.


Amazing! Sucks stuff in. Hides lumps. Love this dress


Great dress for the price. I got so many compliments wearing it- nice stretchy fabric that was flattering. Got it in blue love it


Great quality and it fits perfectly. I wear  A US 8 and a large fit me well enough. The material stretches so u couldn't see the extra spaces. A medium would have been the perfect fit. But I will recommend.


This dress was a great buy! I am 5'11 and I weigh 176 lbs. I wanted a dress that was not tight and long enough to wear to work. This dress came to my knees and was very flattering.
