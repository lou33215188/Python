I loved it! To be honest I was doubtful when I ordered, but this dress made me look so pretty! I had an interview on a TV show and everybody loved it.


Very pretty and fits nicely, however, the white is completely see through. I recently bought a slip to go under it.


Great addition to wardorbe.  It has great stretch and hugs curves


Wow! My granddaughter looked so gorgeous in this dress.


I love this dress!!!! It fit me just right in all the right places! It was not to tight or to loose. The split in the back was the perfect length. I was able to dance and move around in the dress with out any restrictions. I did wear a girdle with this dress and you could never tell.


Love it!! Size small, only 5'0 ft and it was perfect height.


I am 5’6”, 145 lbs. I ordered the medium in purple. Fits perfect. The material stretches. I usually wear a 6 or 8. The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is that it’s really tight under the arm pits, more on the right. Other than that, I love it. I ordered the purple. The color is exactly as shown.


The perfect little black dress! The material is heavy, stretchy, and helps create a flattering figure. Love it! We didn’t get any photos at our event so I only have a bathroom selfie, but hopefully it helps. I’m 5’4” 145lbs and wear a size 6. I ordered a medium and it fit great!


Classy dress!


I wore this dress to a funeral and then to a party the next week.  I love the style and the cut.  The only thing is if you are busty on the top, the fabric by the chest area does stick out every so often and needs to be tucked back in.  Otherwise I love this dress, I wished it had more color selections in stock.
