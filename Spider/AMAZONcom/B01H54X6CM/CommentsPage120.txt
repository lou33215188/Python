Dress is really well made. Fabric is thick enough to hide under garments. I would purchase from this manufacturer again. Cut very flattering to curvy figures.


Great quality and great fit at an unbelievable price ..... dress looks like it could have cost hundreds.  Gorgeous in person !!


Beautiful dress. Material wrinkles easily


Very flattering.  Fabric nicer than expected given the price.  Great little black dress for inexpensive price.


Really good quality, especially for the price. Nicely put together, good quality fabric. I'm really pleased.


This is a beautiful, elegant dress. I ordered a size up and it fits perfectly. Good buy! I love it.


Ordered a size up because i didnt want it to be too body fitting for my job interview. Including a nice blazer the dress fit amazing


I LOVE THIS DRESS I GOT A SMALL (which I usually wear) IT FITS PERFECT LIKE A GLOVE BUT STRETCHES TO MOVE FREELY AHHHH IM SO HAPPY !!!!!!!


I like the color like it


I usually wear a medium to large size.  The large was somewhat small and ended up ordering an XL.  I do like the material.  It stretches enough to feel comfortable wearing it.
