Cheap material, it would look great if you have no "rolls", however, it did not look well and I would not have felt comfortable wearing it to a semi-formal event. I'll be returning this dress tomorrow.


When I took it out the box it was nothing to look at but once on it was magnificent! I love the dress and can't wait to wear it for the occasion I purchased it for.


I love it and a great fit


"OMG" GORGEOUS


Beautiful Dress, fits perfect


this was definately a good buy fit perfectly even though i didnt wear it for the event it was a head turner


for reference i am 145lbs, 5'10" i ordered a medium


I love this dress! I wore it to a wedding and I felt Beautiful!!!


The fit was good, arrived with a stain....hopefully I can get it out


Love, love, love!


Beautiful dress and perfect fit. Looked fabulous at the event.
