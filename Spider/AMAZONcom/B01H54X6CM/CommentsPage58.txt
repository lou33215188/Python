This is a very gorgeous dress and it is very well made. Love the way it hugs my curves.


The material is stretch and a bit big.  The material is not what I expected.  I thought it would be like satin quality, but it is like semi shiny cotton, and looks cheap.  I had to return it.


Love this dress! I bought it for a wedding.  It looks exactly as it is pictured.  The only complaint I have is that the material is really high in the underarm area.  I don't like when dresses dig into the skin there and it was definitely happening with this dress.  Had to take it to the tailor to get adjusted.  Other than that, it fits like a glove.


I  have ordered at least 4 of these dress in different colors.  I love the fabric and the fit.


It's a lovely dress, I order size S but it doesn't fit me, it was to big.. But other than that, the dress is lovely! I have it to my sister in law and she absolutely loves it as well!


This dress is not designed for women with a large bust.


A little on the tight side for a work dress, but the length is AMAZING. I am 5'9, so dresses are usually too short for me, and this covered my knees, so I felt like, even though it was a little tight, it was still okay for business professional w/ a suit jacket.


LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress! Got lots of complements on this. Only thing I did notice that others did as well was the weird flap in the chest area. But nothing a little fashion tape can not fix!


This dress is AMAZING!!! Great Color, Quality and Fit.  Very flattering and I usually wear a size 6 but recently gained weight and the Medium was still ideal.  I recommend this dress, you will love the compliments that come with it.


I wear a size 4-6 so I ordered the small. It was way too small. Dress is not for anyone with curves. Also, the material of this dress is not work appropriate if youâ€™re in a very professional office job.
