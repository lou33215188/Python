Exactly like picture my sis loved it


I have never in my life received a package from a company that smelled like cigarettes!! This dress reeked of it!! So badly that it stunk up my room when I opened the bag!! I have no idea who this company is!! But it's horrible to send out products smelling like this!!  My daughter is allergic to cigarette smoke and she is full on having an attack right now that I have to take this dress and bag outside!! It being in a bag was so strong it stunk up the rest of the other packages!! I would give it zero if I could!!


Fit very good


Perfect


Very pretty fits well


I sent them back!


It fits beautifully


Beautiful dress but the sizes are small. I also had a friend who ordered this dress in her usual size but again, it was too small. Tight. Not true to size.


Love, love, love it!


Comfy and sexy
