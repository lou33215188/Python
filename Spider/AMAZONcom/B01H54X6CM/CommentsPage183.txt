Not satisfy


A true must buy.  Absolutely love.


Love it


Love it!!!


Great dress, good stretchy material on bottom would order another color if they had it. Only complain was that it was a bit smaller on top then on bottom. I could have used a medium but because the top was too tight I had to go with the large. Other then that I would totally recommend this dress. Received lots of compliments.


The fabric is too stretchy... you have to keep you hands on the the dress dragging it down and adjusting it constantly.


It  literally just up to my underwear.


Also, it EXTREMELY wrinkles.


I only wore it once and thank God the weather was a bit cold and I had a long rain coat in my car. Otherwise would have so embarrassing at work.


Very tight fit...runs small. Plus, neckline is too big, so one side is droopy. The neckline does not lay flat, showing the inner seam.


I received this packaged right before I left for a family wedding, followed by a 2-week vacation. When I returned, I had to pack my daughter up and move her into college. I've missed the 30-day return policy (WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT) and now I cannot return this I'll-fitting dress which will never be worn and I'm out 30 bucks!!! Buyer beware!!


Pretty color and dress but it arrived dirty. Also hugged curved too much


Great fit length fit etc. just perfect I am 5'11 220


I got sooooo many compliments on this dress. I am 5 7  148 lbs and normally have a hard time finding a dress that goes below my knees. I decided to order an XL and I love it!. The fabric is stretchy so the dress is comfortable. Since I ordered the bright blue color I wore spanx under my dress just to keep all my uh assets from moving around lol.
