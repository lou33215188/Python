Loved this dress! Perfect length and TONS of compliments!


This is great for the price. It's not high quality material, and it feels cheap, but doesn't look cheap. It's comfortable and fits pretty well. The top is a little loose on me. I thought it would hit above my knee, like cocktail length, but it fell below which made it seem a bit more formal. I'm 5'7. So just a note to consider. I definitely recommend it for the cost!


I love the material and the way it hugs my curves.  I also love the way it minimizes your tummy appearance so you appear smaller. However, at 5'4, its way longer than I expected.  It comes past my knees.  I still love it and got lots of compliments on it.  Oh, the piece that sits right at your cleavage is a bit of a bugger also.  It doesn't stay like its supposed to and I found myself constantly tucking it back in.  Ultimately, still a good buy for the price.


Iâ€™m 5â€™10 and have a hard time finding dresses for work that are long enough. This dress goes past my knees and a medium fits well for my 140 pound self. I possibly could have went down a size but the material is stretchy. I thought it was pretty good quality also. Will probably buy more of these in different colours.


I'm 5'6" 165lbs size 10 and 38C. I ordered a large and it fits great however you cannot wear any kind of underwear with this or the lines show through. I've tried every kind of seamless underwear out there and now it just hangs in my closet. I stupidly ordered the purple and black at the same time and I've never been able to wear them. Maybe the black would be alright because it's not as noticable but unless it's dark out then no.


I gave this dress a 5.  I ordered the size XL based on reviews, but actually ended up needing a size XXL due to my well endowed top.  I'm going to reorder this dress.  i was very impressed wit the fabric, style and the fit.  It was stretchy, but I'm very curvy and just want a little extra space i those areas that don't need stuff to be too tightly.


This dress is stunning!  I'm 5'8", 150lbs and bought a large.  The fabric is thick and tight enough that it holds in your jiggly spots without making you look like a sausage.  I purchased it in black which hides the fact that it's an odd material - thick and stretchy and not what typical little black dresses are made of.  But wow!  The style and the ruching make me look 20 pounds lighter.  No Spanx required!  The length is just below the knees, making it even classier looking.  It would look great with a choker.


Wow! Iâ€™m 5â€™7, 125lbs and i bought a small, I was nervous it was going to be too tight. I canâ€™t believe how perfectly this fits! The material isnâ€™t see through at all and it gives the right amount of stretch so that itâ€™s super comfortable to wear. I canâ€™t wait to break out my famous dance moves in this dress! ğŸ’ƒğŸ�¼ğŸ•ºğŸ�½


Beautiful dress with a very unique cut. I would give it five stars but the neckline doesn't stay flat. It seems like it would be a simple fix for the company and should be since I see that as a complaint for many buyers. Otherwise, it's a very beautiful dress. It does tend to rid up a bit but nothing major. I wish they had the dress in a heavier material for the fall. This is more suited for spring and summer.


Ordered this last summer but finally got a chance to wear it to a holiday party last night and it was a hit. I'm 5'7" and wear a dress size 12 but I forgot I purchased the XXL for some reason that I found in the reviews perhaps, nevertheless I'm glad I did because as you can see it fits snugly, yet it was very comfy. The ruching on the front and sides of the dress is a very nice touch, and the material is durable, nice, and comfy and a wee bit stretchy. I will be buying a couple more in different colors.
