I sent this back, the way it is gathered at the side gave my silhouette a tummy pooch I do not have


I love this dress! Fits like a glove. I am a size 2 in women's dresses, ordered a small, and it's perfect. Very classy.


I tried it on when I got it. Haven't worn it out of the house yet but I think I might need to wear either a slip under it or all dark underwear. The material seems like colours will show through.


This dress is truly amazing! I'm 5"1 about 180 pounds and I bought a size 2x it fits perfectly. I feel like a million bucks!! Ladies don't hesitate to snatch this ond up. Great quality, cut and color. Simply beautiful!


Thanks to previous reviews I knew what size to buy. I am 5’3” 135 lbs and the small fit perfectly. Love this dress. Very classy. Comfortable.


Nice quality dress. Great for work or a dress/casual evening out. it fits and flatters nicely.


Beautiful dress, fits great but see through. So disappointed because I really like this dress.


Gorgeous dress. The fabric is very forgiving and super comfortable. Fit like a glove and looked great.  Awesome style and can't beat the price. I would order this in every color.  I loved it!


This is great for the office/dinner or drinks for an after work meeting. Very comfortable. You need to get it to fit, not loose. I think it's a very classic look.


Midi skirts and dresses aren't flattering for my 5'4" frame, so I took it to my tailor and had it shortened.  Cute dress for work.
