I usually wear a medium, but am glad I purchased a large. I love the shape and detail!


LOVED it, once I finally received the right dress.


Beautiful dress.


I get so many compliments on this dress! Love it!


4 only because of inside collar above breast area folds out.  But fits great


Great dress!!


Great fit looked great on someone with hips flattering from head to toe


For the price this dress was awesome. It fit properly


Nice dress. Fit as expected. Nice stretch. Somewhat sheer/transparent


BEAUTIFUL and recommend it to everyone!!
