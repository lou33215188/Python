Nice dress u actually love it


Love the dress. I got lots of compliments. I'm a 14-16 well 14 mostly and I orderd a XL. A tad big but looked really nice on me.


Fits perfectly. No flaws.


My wife says the dress is beautiful, the material is nice but she wears a size 8 or medium but had to go up a size to large.


Great fit, elastic, good fabric (not even sweaty after a night dancing!)


One of the best dresses I own! Hugs in all the right places:)


Amazing dress


Size is true to the measurements provided.  In other words expect to get a larger size.  The fit is phenomenal


Decent fit, sewing could be a little better though. The ridges aren't sewn properly


This is my new "go to" dress for interviews! It's very flattering and fits true to size. I love the color too
