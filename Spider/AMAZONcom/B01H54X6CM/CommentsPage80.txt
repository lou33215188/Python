4 stars because it's see-through. Haven't decided if I'll return it. It fits GREAT though. Stretchy fabric hugs curves really well.


va va voom..


I am 5'4 190 pounds I order an XL and this dress was stunning. Don't hesitate to purchase.


It was to large, ordered the Medium and fit well. I was a day or 2 late to return it, so now I own it. Bummer.


Love the material, and was fitted but not skin tight.


Nice dress fit just right


I ordered a sz medium based on other reviews I’m like a 6/8 and the medium fit me perfect hugged every curve.  If you don’t want a fitted dress I suggest that this is not the dress for you. I’m 160 lbs and 5’6 tall. Hope to help.


I ADORE this dress!!! Want one in every color. I’m 5’6, 145 and the dress fits perfectly. Super sexy, but classy at the same time.


Poor quality. Looked cheap.


Awesome!
