The color and fabric are beautiful. But the bib thing in the front wonâ€™t stay down. I rocked it any way though!


nice dress fits well


weight 137 pounds, 34D breasts, 5 feet 4 inches. I bought size M, expands a lot


I would have liked more adjusted :(


Very nice outfit have to wear it out yet but great pick


Love the fit, great material!


Very nice! Arrived on time. It fits perfectly. I'm a size 3 and a small fits perfectly.


Perfect fit, Amazing quality, will write better review and post pictures after I have it dry cleaned!!!!!


Had to get some alterations done.  The size smaller was to tight across the hip. The larger size to large across the top.


It was perfect


Excellent. ...beautiful and good quality
