The color was no where near the color I expected.  The dress was more of a navy blue,


Such a beautiful and flattering dress! Quality material with enough stretch to be comfortable. I was concerned that the length would be too short as dresses often are, but the length is perfect. Only thing I don't love is the lining on the top. The material is a little sheer, so a nude bra and underwear are a must. But the lining you can see on the white dress. A simple fix will do it though so I'm not concerned and it doesn't take away from the dress. The gathering on the side is so flattering and really hugs my curves. For reference I am 5'5" and 135lbs, I purchased a size small. Measurements are 32-27-36. Bought to wear on our anniversary.


Not a good fit for my body type


Nice material but I ordered a large and XL was sent which was wayyyyyyy to big.


OMG!  I LOVE this dress!  I knew as soon as I saw it, it was going to be the perfect dress for me.  I bought it to wear on my birthday in Punta Cana, and can't wait to show off my curves.  Ladies, you will not regret buying this dress!


Nice


Neckline was a bit off & I had to fidget with it all night But overall not disappointed. Got many compliments. I am a size 16 and got an XL.


Falling apart everywhere after the very first wear and dryclean


I am 148lbs, 5 feet 5 inches and the medium fit perfectly! It's super sexy but has some stretch and hugs in all the right places.


Love this dress! It fits perfectly to my body and is very stretchy. In other words not only does it looks like a tight fight and compliment me but I can move in it too. I am 153 lbs and 6' tall and I ordered a large in grey even though I normally wear a medium I am a 36B and it fit all the way around beautifully. Hope this helps. :)
