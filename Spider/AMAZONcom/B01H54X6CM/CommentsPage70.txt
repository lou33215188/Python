fits


Love! Love! Love this dress. The only thing I don't like is how the top of the dress doesn't lay flat. It gaps open a little but the fit of the dress is perfect and hugs in all the right places.


perfect


I already had a black dress and I love it.


It's small for the size. I usually wear a  large but I ordered a 2x in this dress and I'm glad I did it is still snug.  Anything smaller would not have fit.


Very nice dress in the black.  I typically wear an 8.  Went with the large since its made in China and it was a prefect fit.


Nice


This dress is everything !! I got it in black and in red. The fabric, the colors and the fit are amazing ! I am 165 lbs, 5 7‚Äù with wide hips. The large fit me like a glove !! Will purchase more.


Perfect fit


The dress is nice but the size is way off. I ordered this dress in large in red and it fits fine. But the grey didn't. It had to go back. I reordered it again in XXL hopefully it will fit.
