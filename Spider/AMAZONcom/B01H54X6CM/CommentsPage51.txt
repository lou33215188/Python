The cut is flattering and it is comfortable.  The material is cheaper than I would prefer and the fabric near the clavicle pops out and needs to be adjusted at times.


Classic sheath dress, not too short, compliments just about any body type....great for any season, love it and I'm buying one in every color.


It comes in a stretchy fabric, but I arrived was bright red not burgundy.


I love this dress! But the Large was too big as I am losing weight. I got the Medium instead and it fit perfectly :) Thank you :) Beautiful dress :)


I bought this dress in burgundy and white.  I normally wear a size 6 for tight fitting dresses due to my wide hips.  I bought a medium and the dresses fit exactly as I expected- perfect on my hips and a tiny bit loose on my shoulders, but overall great. Sadly, the white is too sheer. If it were double layered it would be my new go-to dress, but I have to return it. I plan to try yellow next, and if that's too sheer I'll get it in black. I love them!


This dress is outstanding... VERY elegant looking.  I am very pleased with both the quality and the fit.  I am 5'10", 116 lbs and bought a Medium.


Im about a size 2 and 5'2 and it fit snug. Im not the biggest up top so it was a little loose in the breast area, but, I still loved it.


Fits well, however the dress has a defect in the top front part. It doesn't lay flat as it is supposed to. The top portion was also sewn a little funny. That is why I gave this dress a 3 star instead of five. I bought a large but I probably could have fit into a medium just fine. Great material and fit other than top front of dress.


Very happy with the fit as it is flattering without being to body hugging.  The material has a little sheen to it so it makes is dressy as I am wearing it to a day wedding.


I really love this dress! It fits perfectly and the color is really pretty! I've gotten a lot of compliments.
