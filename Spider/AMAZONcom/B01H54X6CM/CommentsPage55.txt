It was a good dress, the only thing was the shoulder just felt weird, but everything else about the dress was good


Looks good & very comfortable. Well made & great value.


Didn't know the dress was spandex and was too tight.  Unfortunately had to retune item.


Dress is cute but unfortunately it is not white.  I purchased a medium (which is what size I always wear, my size doesn't deviate).  Dress does fit and I have no problems zipping it up, but I would definitely consider it a small medium.  I'm going to return it and probably order a different color for another event, as my current event calls for WHITE.


It makes me look spectacular, with all the right curves.  Not too tight.


I bought one in a another color and decided that I loved it so much I wanted it black- I love it! Fits beautifully and is so flattering!


Great material! I am 5â€™5 measurements 37-28-40. I ordered a large and it was a little too big. The length was just below my knee which I really liked. The red is a beautiful color!!


great dress! ant wait to wear it, will upload a picture when I do.


Dear goodness is this a dress!  If you have an hourglass-figure or are very slender, this is a dress for you!


This dress makes me look awesome - it hugs all of my curves and actually gives me a waist.  It fit exactly as expected (I'm a size 4)  I washed it (instead of the suggested dry cleaning) and it came out fine, except very wrinkled.  I haven't attempted to iron it yet, but I have high hopes.  GREAT dress!
