I am overweight and this dress made me feel comfortable despite being very form-fitting. You will need to iron it before you wear it the first time.


This dress is geogeous the color is so rich it matches perfect with my necklace


I did get the dress 1 size up which fits perfect I have a big butt so I didn't want it super tight in that area


Classy, comfortable, and I especially love that it fit me mid-calf for that elegant finish.


I loved this dress so much, I ordered three additional styles in three different colors from the same maker. A lot of stretch, so it's hard to go wrong, even if it runs small. LOVE!!!


This was perfect for my wife.  The material was very smooth and it fit her body perfectly!


It fits perfect! Much better than I expected, the quality of the fabric is great to hold everything in place. It is comfortable and gorgeous!


This dress is amazing for the price. Go by the size chart. Iâ€™m 5â€™8â€� and 125lbs and the small fits perfectly. Not too tight, not loose. I used to model for several pinup brands, and the quality is somewhere bewteen Steady Clothing and Stop Staring for a fraction of the price (no disrespect to either). The fabric is sturdy enough to hide slight imperfections but also stretchy. I got Navy ğŸ˜Š


This dress looks very nice on me, I got a Medium. I usually wear a size 6.  I am 5ft 1 inch 135 lbs, 34D - 26.5 waist - 32 - 33 hips


I have this dress in two colors.  The fit is wonderful, so much stretch in the fabric you could gain 5lbs and it still fits nicely.


fit great (5'7 36D 180lbs) nice length, comfortable form fitting without being overly tight and uncomfortable.


cons- smelled weird like a chemically smell i spayed it with a fabric spray it and left it out to hang/air out it mostly went away.


there is a weird piece of fabric in the bust area that wouldnt stay tucked away very annoying but other than that i loved the dress.
