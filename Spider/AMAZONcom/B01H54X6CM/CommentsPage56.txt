Great looking dress especially for the price!


I’m 5’8” athletic build approximately 145 Lbs and purchased size small.


I plan to wear it to work and it can be accessorized for an evening event too.


way too large. got the xs and im a 0. i was drowning in fabric


Gorgeous fit but was a bit disappointed with the fabric.


Better quality then what I expected. Love it!


Nice Dress and I love the material. It is made well for women with big breast which is hard to find. Beautiful color and design.


Beautiful dress, well made, fits amazing! I will say it runs small, a large is a size 6 or 8!


Nice dress just wasn't right for my body type


The slit is super high...and the top/front of the dress (chest) keep rolling up (doesn't stay flat).


This dress does not look like the picture at all. It’s cheaply made,  and it’s something I may wear to work with some Sandals on a casual day.. the style looks pretty! But thats about it..


The best looking dress I bought in a long time.  I fights like a glove.  The color is just beautiful .  The fabric hugs the body in all the right places.  Its reasonably priced.
