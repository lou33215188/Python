This is a very nice dress . I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the item. I received an abundance of compliments the day I wore the garment . I would definitely purchase more items . Thank you for being so honest and upstanding compared to some people with you items.


I love this dress!! It's a little thin, but summer dresses usually are. Just make sure all your curves are in the right place and dimples are smoothed out! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜˜


The fabric is nicer that I expected.  After reading reviews I followed the sizing chart!!!! I'm 5'5" 150lbs. 36D; Bought an XL!!! For just perfect, the material is stretchy, cool feeling and some how not got at all!  I would buy this dress in another color.


I purchased the grass green for my rehearsal dinner! (Sicilian tradition to wear green the day before the wedding) I'm so happy!!


Nice dress


Very fitted yet the fabric is stretchy. It is flattering but I'm wearing a spanx under to smooth everything out. It's seems to be well made. I got the navy blue and it's heavy fabric.


Let me start by saying, I really loved the concept of this dress and it had great potential! Unfortunately, it was way too big. The pleating in the stomach area was weird too. I'm 5'6" 118 lbs and am proud to say, I have a flat stomach. This dress make me look about 5 months pregnant. I really loved the neckline but the straps were too wide and fell off my shoulders. I'm thin, with no hips, and try to find dresses that help me look like I have shape. The material was FANTASTIC! I loved the feel of it. It was a dress that could have gone from work to dinner and looked fabulous. It's a shame it didn't work with my body and was too big. Oh, it's also quite long. Now, I love longer pencil skirts, but if you're wanting something that goes just below the knees and you're 5;11", you'll want to either have it hemmed or look elsewhere.


I wear a size 6. I ordered a size Med. The dress was VERY tight and see through. It showed everything. I didn't feel comfortable wearing it, so I returned it. If you wear this dress, I would recommend wearing shapewear as well. I could order a large but I'm concerned the chest area would be too big.


I was not expecting this dress to fit or be great quality because of the price but i am so glad i gave it a try anyway!  It fits absolutely perfect and is a fantastic dress for a wedding or special event.  I ordered a small and an 5'7 and 135 lbs.


LOVE, love, love the dress â�¤ The fit was almost perfect! Hugs all the right places. The material is great. I'm 5'2 113 lbs bought a small, fit great expect length so I did hem it about 2 to 3 inches. I would definitely buy it again.


Great dress! I wore it as Velma Von Tussle in the musical Hairspray


I ordered up 2 sizes, but the bust looked like I was trying to bind my girls.  This is often a problem for me, as I am big in the shoulders and across the back, so I ordered another that was one size larger.  Still tight in the bust, but way too long in the torso.  The hips were down at my thighs.  I guess I need to stick with petite-size dresses.  It's a shame, because it would have been a knock-out dress.
