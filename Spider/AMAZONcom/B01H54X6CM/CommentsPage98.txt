Wrong dress was delivered to my home. Bummed bc this one looked pretty and one that came was hideous!


Love love love this dress... I'm 5'4 137 got a large and need to exchange it for a medium.


Love the way this dress fits! Great quality and very flattering. I'm 5'7", 190 pounds; the XL fit perfectly! Length hit below my knee.


Great slender and very pretty


Considering I am mom to a newborn (11wks), this dress fits very well. The quality fabric os wonderful.


Lovely for office party


This is the best dress ever! It fits like a glove!  I ordered 3 more in different colors!! I got so many compliments on it at work and no one believed that I got it from Amazon. I might even get some more colors!


WOW!  What a nice dress.  Everything everyone said it was.  Well made.  Nice, thick, stretchy fabric.  I am definitely going to buy another one.  My fault for purchasing a little large, but was going by reviews.  Chinese sizes can be all over the place, so I always go up.  I am a solid 14; 5' 7" 180 lbs. and bought a XXL.  I definitely could have gone with an XL, but am not displeased with the XXL.  I don't wear tight clothes to the office so this will work.  If it was a lighter color, it may *look a little large.  This is a PERFECT office dress.  Not only will I buy another one, I am going to see what else this manufacturer has for me.  Thank you, MUXXN, for creating and selling such a nice, quality garment at an affordable price.


Amazing!


Beautiful outfit
