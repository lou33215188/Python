I luv the way it fit. The color was great. I bought more in other colors.


The dress was amazing! Ordered to attend a wedding and came right on time.


I bought this dress in yellow size small. I'm 5ft, 130lbs. I fit like a glove. Love it.


I did not expect to like this dress given the price and unknown brand, however, I absolutely loved it! The only reason I am giving 4 stars is that it arrived in a bag very wrinkled, and the care instructions tell you not to iron it. I had purchased it with 2-day shipping because I had an event to go to, and getting the wrinkles out without time to take it to a dry cleaner proved to be VERY difficult. Also, the decorative pleats ironed into the dress were not done well and left odd wrinkling that had to be ironed out. I did end up using an iron on medium and was just very careful when ironing it. I tried to iron inside-out, but wrinkles were still visible on the outside of dress, so I ended up ironing it on the outside of the dress and it did not ruin it. Overall, after getting most of the wrinkles out, the dress fit like a glove. I usually wear a small in shirts/dresses, and 4 in pants and I ordered a medium because the reviews said it runs small (THANK YOU). It was fitted without being tight or pulling anywhere. Great color (teal), not see-through, no visible underwear lines, slit in the back was not too high given the length of dress, dress hits below the knee. It does wrinkle as you wear it.


Perfect fit  and flattering.


I love this dress. The fabric was great


Went lovely for my holiday party.


So pretty!!


dont buy if you're petite and size 2 & 0. Too large... Fabric was not soft & stretchy thought it was...


Love the color and fit.  Too bad it doesn't having lining so I will have wear something under it.  Ordered the yellow.
