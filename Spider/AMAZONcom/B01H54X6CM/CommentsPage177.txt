liked the dress did not fit


I absolutely love this dress. I am a Avid Amazon Shopper and this is one of the best purchases I've ever made.


Very large around the mid section. Go down a size when ordering this dress. I did return this item


Love it!!


Good news: I received a black dress. Bad news: I received an entirely different black dress. I ended up keeping it. My mother convinced me to add it to my collection in case I needed it one day.


runs small bought xl too tight


Very thin quality. fit is good


I bought this dress in navy blue and yellow.  The fabric is fantastic and great quality!  It's stretchy and fits really well.  It runs slightly small so you may want to order one size up.  Overall, it's a great dress!
