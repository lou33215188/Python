Wearing it now.  Fabric is a good bengaline-type.  Husband likes.  Got gray for the office - would feel a little too sassy in a different color (although I had wanted the navy, it was out of stock).


Nice dress


Nice stretchy material and was fancy enough for an upscale rehearsal dinner and casual enough with a shrug to wear to a brunch.


Very flattering. Form fitting... very stylish


Got the emerald green in medium. Fantastic dress. Wonderful cut and colour.


I first ordered a medium since i wear a size 10 it was to small I returned and ordered a large and it was also small


Love the stretchiness of the fabric.  I will order more.


Beautiful and good quality.


The dress itself it cute! It was a little big and longer than expected but still like it.


Order a bigger size. Also sewn together kinda weird proportioned for me. Could be a predict fit for someone with small shoulders and waist. I am a size 10 and around the rib cage was to small for me.
