I went by the size chart and not by the size I buy in store and the dress fit perfectly.  The material was thick enough to not be see through.


Love it


Dress came with a broken zipper.  I was not able to even try it on.  Will be returning it.


The write dress is too "see through", i had to take it to a tailor and add a cover for under the dress. Besides that, the material is nice and it's a nice dress.


Beautiful material and color. Perfect for work!


I receive so many compliments with this dress. I love MUXXN items, they all fit extremely well.


It's very beautiful and exactly as the picture depicted. I love it.


Great dress and very flattering! Just needs to be a bit bigger.


Absolutely stunning.


Amazing fit!


So satisfied I bought the blue & the green.


I'm 5 ft, 155 lbs. The dress is 7 inches  too long, but I kept it because it's good quality and nice design.  I had to cut 7 inches
