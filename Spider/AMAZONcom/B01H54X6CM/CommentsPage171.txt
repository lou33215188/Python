LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS. Absolutely perfect fit. Very well made dress and nice quality fabric.This dress can be worn as a business outfit or you can add some fine jewelry and it makes a perfect cocktail dress. It's very versatile and I highly recommend this product. I plan on ordering more colors and various style.


Good material


Thin material, yes, but looks awesome on.  Very flattering dress.  I am 5'7 and weigh 130.  Ordered a small and it fits perfectly. Wear spanx though.


The color was shockingly yellow neonish, in my opinion, not for me.  Really cute.  The fabric was really, really stretchy.  My figure couldn't do this dress justice.


The blue is very vibrant (5 stars) and exactly what I wanted...but the material felt somewhat cheap, I was expecting a scuba like material but it is actually very stiff. Also, the straps were too long and bulky, and the back gaps so I'll have to have it altered so it'll fit properly. I think it would have fit much better if the material was different and molded to the body like a true bodycon. I'm 5'3 104lbs and a 34C. I was kinda disappointed


Excellent fit! Spectacular Color!


Perfect fit..

Perfect


Returned this item. the shoulder piece kept slipping off my right shoulder. The fold at the breast line on the underside keeps coming up out of the top of the dress makes it look cheap and poorly made. Not bad for a one evening stunner looking dress, for the price but nothing to have for a long time or wear often. I bought the XL. I'm curvy. It fit but I didn't like it. Color is fabulous. I wear a 10/12 with 36B bust
