I am so surprised by this dress! This is my first successful on-line dress purchase. It fits great, and its comfortable spandex material fits perfectly. I highly recommend!


Dress has a linen material looked..  Very nice, I returned it because it did not fit as I expected.  I was also refunded the same day I dropped it of at UPS.


A little big across the shoulders otherwise very cute


The dress is cute, but a little smaller around the arms.  I got a rub mark on my armpit area because it was too tight!  Otherwise it's a comfortable dress.


Just as the positive reviews said.  The dress compliments all body types.


Love this dress! great material and fit very well.


The ripples across the body of the dress lay weird when worn.  It look fantastic in the pics though.


Very pretty dress, nice quality  A little too long, but I had it hemmed...looked great


The dress is nothing like it is shown. I bought the dress and it was stretchy the large wouldn't fit someone who wore size 12 or 14 in women's. The white is more ivory and the dress doesn't as presentable.


Very nice dress. Although i think I could've bought a large but okay with  having extra room.
