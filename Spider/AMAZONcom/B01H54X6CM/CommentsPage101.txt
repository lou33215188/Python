I love it just a little too long but great! Got s lot of compliments.


The dress isn't lined and the fabric isn't great BUT the cut is amazing, the fit is fantastic, and the price is so reasonable that it's a great value. I had at least 15 compliments on the first day I wore it.


Love it


Fabric and fit are awesome!


Received tons of compliments.... dress is more spandex than polyester so choose your color wisely as different color material can make it look cheap


This dress fits perfectly, it is so flattering. I want one in every color.


Love the fit, very comfortable and stylish, got a lot of compliments wearing it, would by other colors or similar styles made with this material.


Perfect fit, great material.


It fits true to size


I love the design and how fitted it was but I didn't like how there is an extra piece of fabric at the chest area on the inside. It was there for no reason and I couldn't hide it from showing.
