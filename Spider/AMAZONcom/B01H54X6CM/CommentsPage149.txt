I love the dress! It was perfect


Beautiful! Really made to hide belly fat and accentuate those wonderful curves!


I was VERY happy with this dress! It is so flattering on the curves. I got a Medium and I am 5'2" 36 28 38, and it fit like a glove - not obscenely tight but tight enough to flatter. Being short, the dress hit just short of mid-calf on me. The quality of the dress is nice for the price, and it's a thick enough material to feel like good quality. I didn't have an issue with it being see-through, but I got the red. My only small complaint is that a seam is unfinished at the asymmetrical neckline, causing it to untuck sometimes - it's an easy fix to tuck it back in, but I found myself adjusting my neckline quite often throughout the night. Otherwise, it's a STEAL!


Love. Fits perfect. Can look business-y or dressy! I think I'm going to buy the white one too.


I followed the size chart suggested and the dress was too small. I am returning the dress.


Great material, and great fit.


I was very nervous about the cut of the dress and how it would fit. The dress is true to its size. Very flattering to the body!!


The material gives it a stretch. This would be great for curvy girls; however, font size up.


Dress itself is ok.  I will be sending it back bc it's a bit long on me.


Comfortable and classy, perfect fit!
