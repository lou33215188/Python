The quality of the fabric is bit cheap but it works perfect for a performance I am in.


I wanted this dress to work for me sooo bad!!


Basically if you are shaped like me, this dress will not work for you. I am pear shaped, but not just pear shaped, i am like one of those bulb syringes you get to clear your baby's nose, or maybe a Hershey's kiss. Very small on top compared to the bottom. For reference my measurements are


Bust 32


Waist 27


Hips 40


Height: 5 ft 9


Length was perfect BUT... The dress pulled too tightly across my hips and was literally falling off my tiny bird shoulders. I bet if you are a more hourglass shape this will look incredible on you as it does in the customer photos. But it will not work if you have a body type like me.


Pros are that it's a lovely dress for the price and the fabric seems like the kind that washes like a dream.


The dress fit perfect and I love it .. I would recommend the dress again to anyone .. Thanks again !


Dress feels like spandex and I ordered 2 sizes larger and it was still ill fitting.  So if you are not shaped like a pencil, don't buy!!!!


Fit perfectly,  was beautiful!


Love this dress. The fit is amazing. the style is perfect. 100 percent recommend


Great look, but get's wrinkles very easily


Love the fit of this dress!


I love that the seams are even.  Good material an sizing chart accuracy was spot on!


My wife love it, thanks a lot....
