Very good dress especially for the price.  I wore it to a retro 1940s club


5'4. 130, athletic.. purchased a small... fit great!! A little see through tho so don't buy if you're self conscious of any fat rolls you may have


Absolutely love this dress! Ordered a small and it fits perfectly. Fabric stretches nicely.


I sized up because I was unsure of the fit. Good thing I did. Ok Look


Great professional looking dress! Material is pretty nice given its polyester. I guess it's a higher grade of it


Love this dress!!  Wore it for halloween, but will definitely wear it again!


This dress looks great but does hug every curve. My measurements are 34-B, 30, 42 clearly bottom heavy and weigh 155.  I typically wear size 10 and some 8's depending on the material. If your measurements are like mine definitely order a large. The only down side is it does rise a little when I walk but if I had gotten a bigger size the top would have been too large.


I love this sexy little number. I'm a size 12/14 in dresses. Size 14 gives me extra space, because I do not like tight clothes. So, I  ordered an XL which fits great. This dress hugs your curves in all the right places.


This item does run a size small, so I order one size up. Other than that, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! This dress looks amazing no matter your body type.


Great dress; wonderful color. Perfect for Easter or a Sunday lunch.
