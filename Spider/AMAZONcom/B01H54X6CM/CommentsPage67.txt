Absolutely GORGEOUS dress


Love it. Super comfortable and looks great for any occasion.


This is an excellent quality dress!!! It's so beautiful. I can't wait to see it on my daughter.


I get lots...and LOTS of compliments about this dress. I love it


Absolutely love it


I’m 5’2” and about 135. Ordered the large. Needed a new red dress for the holiday season... office holiday dinners and etc. Fit is perfect, but it is long past my knees so I am going to have it shortened about 3 inches so it hits my knees. Other than that, very pleased.


Dress has amazing color and fits great!


a little big in the back...but i have a pear shape and i run into this issue at times...


Beautiful cut, length, and color...but the dress likes to ride up and the dress digs into my armpits, consistently had to pull this dress down.


Fits nice but too long for petite people...needs to be hemmed.
