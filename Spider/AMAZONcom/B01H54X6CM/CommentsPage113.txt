I loved this dress but as I walk, it would twist in the back.I probably should have went up a size but I loved how it hugged my curves


She loved it and received a ton of compliments on it at a wedding we went to it


Very pleased with this dress.  The fabric has some nice stretch to it and the pleats are flattering.  The dark green is beautiful - just what I was looking for.


Amazing! Color was true to the picture.  Very comfortable. Ordered the dress for Easter Sunday.


Didn't like the fit or design.


Gorgeous! Fit as expected. Flattering to my curvy figure! Love it!


Wore this dress to a business conference. Everyone loved it and the purple color, fit perfectly. Recommended it to one of my friends who loved it !


Very stretchy and tightly fitted.  You'll feel like you're painted into this dress, but the shirring makes it flattering.


Love this dress. I received so many compliments. I ordered a size Small. I’m 5’5” 138lbs 34DDD.
