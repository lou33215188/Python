I love this dress! I took the recommendations posted by other buyers and ordered a size larger than my regular size and it fit perfectly.  There is fabric in the inside of the front that rides up, but a strategic safety pin to your bra should keep it under control.  I wore it to a wedding and the dress held up beautifully, even after dancing the night away.  Definitely a good buy.


Beautiful dress. I don't like the material though. But its a great dress and a great fit!


This dress is great. Fitted and not to short for work.  5'5, 130 pounds, c cup. I bought a medium.


The product arrived on time with no issues. My measurements are 36 (B) 30 (W) 47 (Hips) and I'm 5' 11". I bought an xxl to fit my hips which it does however I was left with an over sized bust area, which I had altered now the dress fits great.


I love they way this dress fits! The only down side is the neck line. The material folds out and makes it look awkward. This is easily fixable if taken to a seamstress


Nice dress but I was looking for something more dressy for the occasion I was attending.


Fit was slightly to big. I'm 5'1 175 I ordered an extra large based on one of the reviews. Dress didn't go to waste  gave it to a relative. Other than that it was great


I do love this dress, and would have given it a 5 if it weren't for a weird flap of fabric under the top. It leaves a line just above my chest that distracts from the rest of the dress. I'm hoping to have a tailor fix it. Otherwise it was perfect.


I love this dress!! I bought it in red and yellow, and both look great! I’m 5’10” with an athletic build.


I wear a size 16 and the XXL was a bit too tight everywhere but the shoulders where I had too much room. I like the style and quality of the dress. The material is stretchy and comfortable. I would go up a size but the shoulders seem to be cut wide and showed my right bra strap. The interior of the neckline has a panel that does not stay put either.
