The top was a bit ill fitted and the mid section is tight.  However i really like this dress, really sexy if u have a flat tummy.


Beautifl material and it's a nice dress


Overall fit was nice....the top is a bit awkward.


I am 5 ft 10 inch 195 lbs and I bought a large. this fit like a glove I love it.


I love this dress so much, fits perfectly!!!!!


I can usually fit large or clear but ordered XXL and it fit very well.  Beautiful color, material and texture on my body.


Beautiful dress and material, love it ğŸ˜Š


Very pretty color re ordering large size


Love this dress.


I ordered the green and it looked phenomenal. The fit was perfect. I'm tall and have a big butt plus I've still got a little tummy from having a baby. The fabric had enough stretch and there were a couple pleats across the abdomen that helped disguise my tummy issue. I'll be ordering a different color.
