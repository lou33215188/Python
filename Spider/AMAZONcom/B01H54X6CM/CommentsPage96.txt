Fit is amazing.


This dress looks like it cost $150.  It's nice and thick material and soooo flattering.


Love it!


Love this dress! My favorite from now on! I bought black ! medium size  and I am 5' 10 ''.  I am 150 pounds and fits perfectly! It gives you a sexy but elegant look!


I love this dress ! Very classy & I love the way it looks on. I did go a size larger because I'm hippie  and didn't want it to tight. My husband loves it ğŸ˜‰ !


will buy another one...it fit like a glove.


Fits beautifully. Very good quality.


Fit very nice


Love the fabric and fit. Looks more expensive than ot is.


I seriously love this dress. I want it in all colors. Previously bought a Medium since I've gained weight but decided to try a small and it fit perfect. I received tons of compliments. I'm 5'3 140lbs.
