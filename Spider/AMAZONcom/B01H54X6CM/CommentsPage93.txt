got nothing but compliments.  Dress fits  like it was cut for my figure


Bautiful color and the fit is perfection Thank you I love my new dress.


Bought a gray medium. I wear size 6 or 8. Perfect fit and I love the color. Very flattering. Comfy material. I probably will buy another color. Super quick delivery!


nice but a little snug. I usually where an 8 had to go to a 10 and its still snug


This dress was an absolutely WINNER for me at our Hats & Bags Luncheon last month. This dress fit me perfectly and I received a rave of compliments as to how well this dress fit me and how beautiful it was.


Beautiful dress, but 2x runs extremely small! Size does not match American sizes!


I didn't like the material on this dress. It also fit me weird in the shoulders. The straps kept riding up by me simply walking in it.


Everyone loves this dress.  It is just the right style.  Not too much but just enough.  It looks fantastic on.  Color and fit were perfect.


The red is amazing, I cannot wait to wear it


Perfect dress same as pictures ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»
