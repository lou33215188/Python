Slightly tighter still even when I got a large instead of my normal size of medium.  But still liked it.  Sophisticated but adds even more great body curves with the assymetrical design.


too small in the midsection and too large on top.  I returned it.


This dress is lovely. I wore it to a professional conference and it has the right professional look while also showing up my curves. The neck line is a weird shape but itâ€™s pretty. I got a lot of compliments on this dress. Iâ€™m 5â€™2 and it hits right below the knee on me.


This dress fit me perfectly for my son's First Communion. I am 5 feet and weight 108 and I ordered the small. It was a little on the longer side so I'm sure it will fit a woman who is taller also. Very nice quality and comfortable!


This dress is so classic.  I love it!  I would never have guessed I could get by wearing a tight dress at 5'2" 160 lbs.  This must be a miracle dress!


I was definitely hesitant about this dress; wasn't sure if it would be worth it or just cheap and junky. But, I'm pleasantly surprised. The fabric is thick and stretchy, and the dark green is a very pretty color. I'm 5'8", 135lb and the medium fits like a glove. Very flattering and sexy without being too much. It is fairly long, hits just past the knee on me. Might look odd if you're short. The pleats on the bust will need a stitch  or two to pin them down, they want to stick out. Overall, great!


Love this dressğŸ˜‰


I love the fit.  I am 5'4" and weigh 150.  K


Ordered Size L.  I will wear my spanx for perfection â�¤ï¸�,. but I look good without in this dress!  I was hoping the color was turquoise, but it is a true grass green.  In my opinion, emerald green.


Not sized the same as other dresses of the same brand. Not very forgiving in the tummy but very pretty neckline and a good dress for someone with a more firm tummy.


The quality and material is great. I bought navy blue in the small and it fits perfect, not too tight, have breathing room.  I am very pleased with the fit for my body type. For reference, Iâ€™m 125 pounds, 5â€™4â€� and C/D cup.
