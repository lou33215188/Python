Can't wait to wear it. Definitely going to be my dress company.


gorgeous dress, just big around my waist and shoulders


MUXXN Women's 1950's... Love it! Wearing to a spring wedding next month with these blue heels :) the one "negative" is that it is a little see through. I'm going to wear a slip to be safe. I'm sure the darker colors wouldn't have this problem. Other than that, it fits as expected. I am 5'4" 125lbs and got a small. Very excited about how cute this is for a great price. I will likely only wear it once or twice. I wasn't anticipating the quality to be phenomenal for under $30 (it's not, but better than I thought it would be). Serves my purposes in a cute/inexpensive way.


OMG you will love this dress


The product is as described


I need to adjust it.
