True to size! I’m 5’7” 132 pounds and a small fit perfectly. Very beautiful the light blue is a turquoise color.

Love this dress! It looks incredible on me. The fit is amazing. Better than I could have imagined


I don't usually get vey lucky with online purchases for dresses but this one is great and fits nicely!


This dress is sleek and sexy. It hugs you and there is a bit of a stretch to the material.


True to my size on the scale and fit great.


Very comfortable and fits in all the right places. Very classy and can wear it to different occasions: wedding, work, church, date night, etc. highly recommend especially for price


I was surprised how well made this dress is! Fits great too! 5’7” 140lbs and the medium is perfect! Love it!!!


Runs large. I used the site’s size guide and it was easily 1-2 sizes too big. Nice fabric, though. Didn’t feel cheap. I liked the ruching on the sides
