Lovely dress, nice color, fits perfectly, clean lines.


this dress is amazing!!!!!!


Love this dress great for the office.


Great fit, very nice material. Good dress for the price. I'm 5'4", 120 pounds and the small fit well.


Perfect for my interview


Liked the dress but it was way too small


The description notes the dress color as white but it is actually an off-white as the picture shows (I thought it was bad lighting).  I had to return it because I needed white.


In love.. great buy. Lots of compliments!


Longer than I expected. Still nice.


Nice fit!
