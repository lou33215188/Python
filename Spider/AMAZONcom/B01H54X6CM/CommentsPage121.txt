This dress is a winner...hugged all the right places.


Worth more than the price. Can be dressed up or down. I love the length and the yellow, though quite bright, is not harsh. I'm going to buy more of this brand


Runs one size too small. I am normally a Small and I ordered a medium and it fit me perfectly. I am 32DD and size 6 pants.


I love the material I love the dress but from the other reviews I order a size larger than I normally wear. So when I order another I will stick to my regular size. Outside of that dress is awesome


Beautiful dress I got a lot of compliments but material is thick...I do not recommend for an outdoor summer wedding.


Dress runs extra small. Not as described.


great material fit perfect.


LOVE LOVE LOVED it!!!!  Great material.  Hugged all the right curves and hid the wrong ones.


Had to return it because it was too big and I didn't like the fit in me. Nevertheless, it is a nice dress.


I haven't worn the dress out but I will find a way to squeeze in the dress! It's beautiful.
