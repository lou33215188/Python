Material is greater the. Expected and it looks amazing


Wasted my money. Huge wide shoulders and tight across the hips. I have a grey size 8 with tags still on it if anyone is interested. Not the look I wanted for my event.


very comfortable


This is a pretty dress but as many have suggested it is definitely a bodycon dress. It was snug on me. I ordered the light blue in a size large. I am 5'4 1/4 and weigh 150#. Hope this helps.


Love this brand! The dress fit perfectly. Use the size chart. Good quality and you cannot beat the price.


Looks and feels great!


I bought the grey dress. Fit perfect and received so mant compliments. I am 5'7 , 150 and the large fir great. Defiantly buying in a few more colors.


beautiful style. horrible looking and feeling material. gave it away.


Love this dress however it is a bit long for my 5 feet stature so I have to get adjustments before I am able to where it.


Fits pretty well. Material was nice. I wore this dress to a wedding and loved it!
