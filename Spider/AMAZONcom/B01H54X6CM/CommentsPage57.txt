Fits exactly as anticipated using the measurements provided by the seller (for reference I am 5'4, 34/26/32, and it hits right under my knees). Great fit and surprisingly good quality given the price.


Although I really liked the shape and colour of the dress, I had to return it because it did not fit my body type. It looked awkward on me.


I'm very happy with the shape, cut, size and color of the dress. It's so great, I will order it in several different colors. However, I will say the top has a piece of fabric across the chest, and it tends to unfold. I can easily use fashion tape to secure, but it is an opportunity for improvement.


The corail colors i recommande at all women


This dress is AMAZING!!! It was a little big but I needed it right away and I'd rather have it a little big that too small. While it was a little big, you couldn't really tell because of the ruching. Loved it and I would definitely buy another if I wanted another color.


Love this dress.  I love the way it fits, and love the quality of the material. It is such a elegant dress. Love it so much I bought 2 more different color. Thank you keep up the good work. I am a very pleased customer.

Gorgeous dress for the office! It has great stretch and fits in all the right places. Will definitely be buying this dress, or others from this company, again! I threw a cardigan over it but could easily do my suit jacket, too! I got so many compliments on it, too!


I love everything about this dress the material holds you in and you can wear it to work, church or party


High quality. Got a ton of compliments. Love this dress. Will order in other colors


I wish they made dresses with separated upper and lower body sizes. It is perfect on the low part of my body, a bit lose on the top. Pretty, seems of good quality.
