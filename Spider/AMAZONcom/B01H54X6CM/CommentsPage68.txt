Terrible color!


The back slit is way too high. I had to sew it. Otherwise, great dress


Material was a bit scratchy.  Might be better in a color other than white that would conceal the material a little better.


Form fitting. Flattering cut. Material has stretch to it.


The dress has all these pre creased folds but they don't stay folded.


Giving 2 stars because I loved how the dress fit me but I bought in order to wear to my college graduation. Everything was fine and dandy until I got to the stadium. The back of my dress ripped. Good thing I had a gown on or it would have shown everything. :(


Excellent


Love this dress! Fit perfectly, nice thick stretchy material.i got tons of compliments! Great buy!


This is a great dress!! Good quality .


This dress is amazing! Fit perfectly and seems to be well made. I think this dress we be great no matter your body type because it has just the right stretch fabric.
