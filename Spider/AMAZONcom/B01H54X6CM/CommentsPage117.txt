Very nice


Love love love this dress!!! Ready to order more colors!


Great dress, good fabric


Love it!


Good fit but a little bit snug.


too long in the torso - measurement from bust to hips not accurate -


I ğŸ˜� it


Fabric is beautiful. Dress is made well. Iâ€™m 5â€™3â€� 125lbs and got a medium- fits perfect.


Beautiful! Fit better than expected. I"m always leary about purchasing clothes online, but I followed the sizing guide and am very happy


I got a medium and it fits perfectly! Very comfortable and flattering. I'm taller and this hit at the knee which was great. (5'9) I plan on getting this in more colors


Vibrant yellow! Good fit. Got lots of compliments ğŸ¤—
