This is a great dress! It is just as pictured and has a great amount of stretch to fit around my booty! I am 34, 27, 39 and I purchased a size small. Since I am 5ft 1in it was long but that is as expected and I had it tailored to fall just above my knees.


This is my second dress...if you love stop staring dress or pinup dresses this is for you..sexy perfect weight...I can't say enough... beautiful


The dress itself from the chest down fit and was form fitting- really nice, but it was too long and the shoulder area was too big. I'm 5'2'', 126 lb. with measurements: 36, 29, 37.


Beautiful am 185lbs and I got the xl getting me another color soon


Bought this dress for my daughter for her birthday. She was absolutely stunning in it.  True to size.  Large 12/14. The issue others were having with the lapel or flap.  She didn't have.


Perfect fit! I get compliments every time I wear this dress! I present at conferences regularly and this is awesome for that setting and for business meetings, as well. I'm 5' 7" and 130 and I got a medium.


Wish that they could have put a light lining in this  dress and it would have been 4 stars!  Overall the fit is great and the color is spot on.  I bought a slip for the dress and now its fine.


Too long for a 5'2 150lbs girl. But I still loved it bc I gave the dress to my sis in law who is 5'7 and fitted her prefect. XL navy blue


I really loved the fit ! I'm 5'2 130 pounds and I got the size small. I went slightly past my knee but that's what I loved about it . With some spanx it was perfect ! Very pretty and elegant . Nice material with some stretch . Received compliments all night


Terrible quality. I expected so much more based on other reviews. Cheap material and awful fit. Way too small.
