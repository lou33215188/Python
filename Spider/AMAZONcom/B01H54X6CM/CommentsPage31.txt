This dress is EVERYTHING!! I am thrilled to have it as part of my collection. I am 5â€™7â€� 170lbs and got an XL and it fits well with a little bit of extra room so I felt comfortable wearing it. I got so many compliments on it and it was so flattering, especially on my hourglass shape. This is the perfect dress to have on hand for all sorts of events or just a nice date night out. It is so good that as soon as the black dress arrived, I ordered it in red, too!!


I can't wait to wear this to a wedding coming up. The shape and style are beautiful. The large falls mid-calf one me (I'm 5'7"). The materials is wonderful and the dress seems very well made. I don't think you'll find a nicer dress at a lower price! I am a pretty true medium and I ordered a large and it fits perfectly.


Beautiful dress, it's just a bit snug and kinda stiff.  I'm sending it back to order a size larger even though I had already order a size up.  Hopefully the next one will fit perfectly.


Bought a different dress by MUXXN that was lovely, similar style but had to return because it was too big in the bust. Went with this style instead and voila! This style fits a smaller to average size bust perfectly. Full busted women may end up feeling kind of squashed in it.


I love the dress! Not super thin material and comfortable. Definitely tighter than I expected it to be, though. I am 5'6" and 135 lbs. I ordered a small and it is very tight.


Pleasantly surprised by quality, yellow color was stunning! While the fabric was plenty thick you may want a slip or support ware to be safe, especially if buying a lighter color. Loved how conservative and elegant this was.


Love it!  Wear a 6-8 women's and the medium is perfect.  Nice heavy material, feels like a good quality.  Some spandex, which is nice for feeling comfortable in.  True to size.  Perfect for work or play.


Beautifull, all coloours, the gray is so cute, but the one I really love Is this Calvin klein with Guess shoes ğŸ˜‰


This dress runs small and even one size larger is very fitted.  I will definitely be wearing something over this dress as it is form fitting.  It is a very cute style, just wish it fit better.


My daughter was between sizes so we got the S and the M to try. The medium fits well, the small was just a little too snug.  My 16 year old feels very stylish and pretty in it.
