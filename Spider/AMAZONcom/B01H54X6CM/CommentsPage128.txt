Amazing dress. I love it. It fits great. Good deal


This dress is nothing like the picture. The material is cotton and Is more like a sundress.


Very happy with the cut of this dress. I'm 5'3" and 150 lbs. The dress in this color is a little sheer though.


nice dress for the price


It's ok, I had it altered so that the folds in the front will does not bulge.


It fits nice I am 5ft 3/4 weight 145pounds. It greats good but I will make it a little tight


This dress is extremely flattering, as long as you are comfortable showing off your shape. I am 5'5 and about 160 lbs and the L fits perfectly. I have really big boobs, but the fabric is stretchy enough to accommodate. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't seem very durable. I imagine after wearing it a few times the zipper might give out, or seams may come loose. For the price, I would say you are getting what you pay for, and the value is spot on.


Great quality! Is my third time buying this brand


Wore this to my sister's wedding Saturday.  I LOVE this dress!  Fits great and got so many compliments on it.  Also very comfortable and stretchy but nice thick fabric.


Love the dress. Ordered a medium had to return it for a small.
