GREAT DRES!! good quality


I LOVE this dress! It makes my body look amazing! I'm going to buy it in another color!


it's nice, but somewhat small than the sizing chart


Color dress isn't like picture, it looks like the green instead of grass green.


The dress looks really nice and lady like. Beautiful design wear.


I love this dress I have two in different colors! Great buy


Poor material and awkward bunches in the middle. Very long even on a 5’8” Woman


Gorgeous!! Im 5'2" 150 and it fits right and  the top is a little loose for my size double Ds.


Longer that what I expected, material is comfy but sheer.. I bought the white one for my bachelorette party... Will need to get some type of body suit to cover the goods.


I loved it for a one time wear. Size up though
