This dress looks great!! The only thing is the opening for the right arm is a little smaller than the left one. I'm still really happy with it so far!


I bought this dress in yellow. - size small. I'm typically a xsmall/small (depends on the brand) but this dress was a little tight on me. The neck area didn't fit well either as i do not have broad shoulders. The material is very thin, so your undergarments might show. I returned the dress.


Good fabric, fits perfectly, I love this dress!


This is the 3rd dress I have ordered from MUXXN


they really have it right with sizeing a curvy girl


Love ❤️ my dresses


The dress was SUPER cute! But I’m 5’7” and 185 pounds. The XL felt like a stretchy small/medium. I sent it back. Really bummed, because it was so cute!


This Dress was absolutely stunning I’m can’t wait to wear it again thank u


Very pretty and form fitting. No issue with the flap of material that people seem to point out.


Completely different dress than what I ordered. Absolutely unhappy with this. I needed a dress for an event tonight and thought I could avoid a shopping trip out after work. Nope. This dress has a scoop  neck, low cut in the front and back. Not appropriate for what I needed it for. Not at all Asymmetrical like the description shows.


Very cute and versatile dress.  I ordered a size up based on other reviewd and it was way too big.  Fits true to size.


LOVE this dress.  very comfortable.
