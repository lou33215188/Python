Color and texture as expected.


Material is substantial, looks great, fits great. Doesn't show every lump an bump but still form fitting.


I love this dress, very flattering on, and comfortable.  My size fit as expected.  I would purchase again.


Originally ordered the small, but it was too tight. Medium is a bit snug, but the fabric does have some give.


Classy and sexy.. I put it on and fit right all over.  And the fabric was nice. Im 5'3" 165lbs and I got a Medium.


I ordered typically wear a sm/med (size 4), I ordered a size small but should have gone a size larger.  A little too tight around the waist.


a bit tight


you will look great!


The dress looks and fits great! I am going to order another one in black.


Runs very small
