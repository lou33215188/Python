Nice dress material is a bit thick.But I live in Florida so it's super hot all the time. I'm 5"6 -125lbs I ordered a medium and it fits perfect.


Seriously in love with this dress. I may buy one in every color. Tasteful but also very sexy and curve hugging. Comfortable stretchy material and at a length you can drop it like it's hot without worrying about your lady bits coming out the back end.


Beautiful, classy and sexy. Iâ€™m 5â€™8, 36DD, 138lbs. Ordered a size M. Fits perfect. High quality design and material.


This dress is amazing! The fabric is thicker than I expected, stretchy, and very flattering. I usually am an extra small, and I got the small. It was a tiny bit too big, and a tad long (I'm 5'6") but still looks great. I got the green, it's an emerald green, close to what the pictures look like. I am going to get it in more colors for sure.


Love the dress fit perfectly , Love the color and can't beat the price ğŸ’¯


Top fits big. The rest fits perfectly.  It doesn't feel tight on.  It's a comfortable and nice-looking dress, save for the loose fit at the top.


I ordered the dress in white, it was fairly see through. I might order it again in a different color for another event (I was hoping to wear the white for my rehearsal dinner), the shape and material were great.


Size up at lease one size.  It will still fit shug. Looks good on.  Very pleased


I ordered two sizes up..good thing I did..it is very nice and fits like a glove


I wanted to try it after so many good reviews. I haven't worn it yet, but it fits nicely! Good material. I'm a 10/12 and hippy. I ordered a large. I wish it wasn't so long past my knees, but I'm short. Worth trying...will probably fit well on different body types.
