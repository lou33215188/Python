Very flattering dress, form fitting. Looks more expensive than it is. I bought several colors. Kept red and gray but green didn’t go well with my complexion though it was pretty. For reference, I bought small, I am 125 lbs and 5’6”, 36-26-36


Very nice & sleek!


Beautiful dress, l t highly recommend it. It fits perfect even though you have some tumy very nice for the price.


since it was stretchy it kind of clings to your fat.


Amazing color and figure flattering cut!!!


Makes me feel sexy i have the blue and the black.


I will be getting the green soon as well


Firs as expected and dress is a nice quality

Love this dress!


This dress was super cute. I've only worn it once and so far it's held up. I'm curious to see how the creases in the fabric hold up after multiple wears.
