I am 5’2 150.5lbs...length wise it was too long, and it was also about 2 inches too long in the shoulders, after having it altered it was an amazing dress!!


nice


First off, before ordering I looked at the reviews and pics submitted and thought women of all shapes and sizes looked hot in this dress. I felt super self conscious trying this on. It is a very body conscious fit  (and I read people wear this to the office ??) and maybe that’s just not me at this stage in life.  I’m about 5’5, super long torso, and very very bottom heavy.  The dark green is a great color and fabric is stretchy. It may just be a little to vavoom for me.  Not sure but a very sexy, well made dress for the price and for the body confident. I got a medium.


Was not very flattering on me. If your looking to hide your tummy, good luck with that. I think it would look beautiful if you have a good figure.


Fit a little too snug...would suggest going up a size that or getting some Spanx


Very cute, great price point!


This dress is gorgeous and fits like a glove!


Tight fitting. Pretty dress. Love the color.


Bought this dress in black and loved it. I ordered the green and its no where near the color in the picture.  Its actuall more of a hunter green.  Only gave it two stars because i was expecting the vibrant color that its shown in.


I would give this dress 5 stars but the zipper started giving me issues after the first wear. Other than that I love this dress. Fits as expected. Good stretchy material. Very form fitting.
