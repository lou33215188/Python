This was a nice dress. It was a tad bit long but other reviews mentioned this so I knew to expect the longer length. The material is very nice, good quality and at a reasonable price. I don't wear dresses very often or else I would order on other colors. I'm impressed.


Beautiful dress beautiful color. I am 5'8 150 and the dress was perfect. I probably could wear a small but why push it. lol. Medium was just right! I bought the purple too and it's also nice. I will have to add a pic later on.


Loved that this dress was super flattering and modestly elegant. It did not feel cheaply made and the material doesn't feel cheap either. It was a little longer than I wanted but it's nothing a seamstress can't fix.


I am 5'10" and 190lbs. My clothes are normally a size 8 or 10 depending on the brand. I bought this dress in a size L and it fit me perfectly. I bought the yellow and the grass green. The yellow was a little see thru (I have a dark complexion) so I returned it for that reason only. The green was perfect for my friend's wedding! I love this dress and will be buying at least one more in another color. ğŸ˜Š


Nice dresses... Very well made. I have ordered them in three different colors. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the smell of the dress and also how there's no instructions on taking care of the dress. Other then that it's worth your $30 dollars.


Fits like a glove but rides up. Also the back slit is too high so when it rides up, it gets a little inappropriate. Might save for winter when I can wear it with tights, so the slit isn't so obvious. Or I'll sew the slit up.


Love the make of this dress, it is just made to be skin-tight and I do not like the way those dresses fit on me. I am returning the dress, but only because of personal preference. The material is excellent and stretchy and hide imperfections well.


This is a lovely dress. I wear a med to large, ordered a large and probably could go up one more size for comfort. I was self-concious ab the sleevesless aspect and returned it, but the dress was nicely made, no see-through and the perfect length just below or at the knee. For the price itâ€™s a great piece of clothing.


I bought this to wear to my graduation. The description said white but this is not white. It's more cream! Fit perfect but I can't wear it. I put it against a white shirt. Color totally off


Thick material but feels like I'm wearing rough or hard bed sheets.. Also was too big. I'm 5'4-5" 105 lbs and small fit like a medium. Fell below my knees. The style is pretty, just not for really skinny people I guess.
