I love the dress however the fit wad TOO tight do I had too send it back. The size is NOT correct.


Love the dress. I ordered this same dress in different colors.


ran true to size if not too big


Great fit and very good quality.  The fabric is stretchy and forgiving.  Very happy with this item.


I bought this dress for my self and I like it fits perfect however the fabric from the neck it rolls up. great product otherwise


Fits Perfect , very nice dress, at 5' 4" and 138 lbs I picked the large and the fit is just right.


Dress fits a little snug. I am curvy!  I order other dresses after I bought this one and went up a size and they are a better fit.


Returned the med, received the large. The size a fabric are good, a tad long for a short girl, but video will keep it.


Amazing color and fit! The fit is so comfortable and flattering. Definitely going to be an essential in my wardrobe!
