This dress will be a great fit IF you go by the measurements that are posted.  I wear a US14 and had to order the 2X and it fits perfectly.


I Love how the material feel on my skin and I got lots of compliments


Form fitting. If you like tight dresses, you may like this snug dress


Poor quality fabric, construction and too small.


A little too long and fitted for me


I ordered this dress in white for a NYE all white affair. When it arrived it was not white! It is a cream color which is completely disappointing! I will be returning this dress immediately.


This really doesn't get any stars with me. It was late. It was not peach!! And runs to size smaller. So if you order it and you wear a M you will need a XL . I didn't give it any stars but they said at least one was required for me to submit my review


Stunning!  Perfect fit for the curvey woman.


DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, SENT ME COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DRESS AND WRONG SIZE TO BOOT! DEFINITELY NOT THE DRESS IN THE PIC!


Very nice, will be ordering in black
