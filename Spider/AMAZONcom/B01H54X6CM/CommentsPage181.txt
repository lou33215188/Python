This was a disappointing fit!! I love the style and the color but the large did not fit as expected.


Runs small


Dress fits perfectly and I got it in 2days. I'll be ordering another color very soon


Was a bit tighter in the belly area that I'd like... may return it


Love this dress! Fits as expected and is beautiful.

Shoulder was too large had to get it adjusted


It's a good quality and looks great on


Fabulous!!!


Dress is very nice and fits perfect.


Comfortable dress with good lines.
