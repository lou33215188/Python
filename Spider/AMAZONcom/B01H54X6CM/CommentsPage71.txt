I loved this dress.  I received so many compliments in it.


Great dress. Color is vibrant and eye catching. The cut of this dress is sexy yet goes down past the knees and shoes no cleavage. Classy sexy. Great fit too. Has some stretch to it so it hugs the body nicely.


Very stretchy. Buy your size. I listened to the reviews about getting a size higher....big mistake. Buy your size.


Great dress! Stretchy material! VERY Mad-Men!


Runs small! Great for curves!
