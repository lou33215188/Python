Wore this as a reception dress for my best friends wedding. It fit like a glove and looked amazing. Good quality material too.


I love this dress! Beautiful fit, shows off the curves. I bought it for work so I'll definitely need a sweater or blazer over to tone it down because it's a little too sexy for my office but I absolutely LOVE it. I also got it in burgundy.


I purchased a Large. I am 5'9 34DD, 29 waist, and 41 hips and it fit really well. The length fell right on my knees (there is a lot of spandex so I had to keep pulling it down) I will buy more colors. *A bit see through*


Lovely dress. Sexy but still classy. My only issue is that it was a bit small and I will need to return to get the next size. I am 5'7 and 170 pounds


A bit long but that can be fixed. Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the inside keeps flipping out at the top so that's kind of annoying. have't figured out how to keep in tucked in. Otherwise, I really like this dress!


Bad quality dress, it was extremely see through.


The perfect office dress. I wear it with a blazer and it fits together well. It looks professional and fits comfortably! I love it and love the fact itâ€™s not too short.


Looked great!  I washed it n it shrunk a little but that was perfect because it was slightly too big to begin with.


Had to return 2X was to small & they don't make a 3X. I loved the material wish I could have purchased this one size bigger :-(
