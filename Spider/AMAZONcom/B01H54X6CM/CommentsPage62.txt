Flattering cut. Nice stretchy material. The red is beautiful!


It's stunning! Not high end but Casual enough to turn heads. Good quality and price. I'm 5'7" and medium fit perfect.


I bought this to wear on a trip to Vegas.  I love the way it fits and it looks.  I received numerous compliments when I wore it.


I am so in love with this dress. It hugs everything ! When I say everything, I mean everything! Gorgeous color! Can't wait to wear it . It's a great buy !


LOVE.  Hugged my curves.  I'm going definitely buy a few more colors.


I absolutely love this dress. It does have some stretch to it, fits as expected. Love, love, love it.


Love the dress and the color. Not for someone that is hippy or bottom heavyâ€‹


amazing quality.  beautiful dress. but runs small I'm a 12 and ordered a large.  too tight.  returning for an XL


Purchased a medium and it is perfect, my measurements are 36-26-36.  Will need to have it hemmed but that is typical for me.  Love the fabric, it has a beautiful stretch to it and it is not too thin.  Purple is true to the color depicted online.  Will purchase this dress again.


thick stretch cotton type fabric - fits snug but covers the cellulite - also bought it in red
