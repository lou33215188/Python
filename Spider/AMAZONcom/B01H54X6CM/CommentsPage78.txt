Does not like how it fits


The dress fit as expected, it hugged my curves just right, it had just the right amount of sexy to it,  I bought an xlarge as I am 5'6 and 180 pounds


The material is kind of thick so I wont wear again until a mild night, other the that the dress is beautiful


ordering other colors


very comfortable and very flattering, especially for the price!


I look for opportunities to where it. I get so many compliments


So I really loved the color and fabric but when I ordered the dress it arrived with a huge gaping hole in the front right above the hem. I thought mistakes happen and ordered again. The 2nd time I ordered they sent the wrong size, a full two sizes smaller than what was ordered. I will not order this product again


very nice dress but it is too big on me I will return it to get the smaller size. I will buy the other colors very pretty.


Cute on but, smaller than size.


Great business dress


stunning and classy


US size 6 and bought Medium because of my big hips. Fits great!
