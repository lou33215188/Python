Nice dress.  A bit large in the chest area, but that might just be me :)


good dress


This dress is amazing! I wore it for my graduation pictures and it was perfect! It's a nice dress for any occasion.


Very light fabric but it will be great for my cruise! Fit perfectly.


very sexy dress


It's a beautiful color and design but better for someone with a longer torso. I am 4'11 and measurements are 31-27-38.


I like my dress  so much  it fit perfect,  but I am a size  LG  us I ordered  2xl large  its  fit perfectly  right
