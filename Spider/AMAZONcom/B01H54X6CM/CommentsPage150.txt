I love the fit of this dress, the only problem I had was the it was the fabric was pretty thin.


Stunning...ordering more


Excellent fit and good quality fabric for the price.


I bought this dress to wear to a work a Christmas Party and it was perfect for the occasion and a perfect fit


Love it!! It fits in all the right places!


That the material was better


Not as high quality as I'd expected but worth the price.


Very nice dress for price. Sexy. Hugs curves. A bit long


Didn't care for the fit nor the materical.


I love the color and this dress is very comfortable on.
