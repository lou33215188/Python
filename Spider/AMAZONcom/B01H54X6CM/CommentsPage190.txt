I like the dress and the material but it think it could be better on tbe top.


Very nicely done, true color I only wish they make XS size.


Like a glove.  Bought this for a little black dress party. It was comfortable and classy. Fits true to size. I usually wear a 10-12 and am 5’9” and weight 170


Love it, but the size isn't the right one


Love it gorgeous and appropriate for work happy hours!


Great fit!!  Will definately purchase another one.


I'm just happy with it . Right sizes!


Loved it.  Made a "splash" at the party.


I need to return it it looks good i needed a XL


Love the dress size was true gorgeous dress
