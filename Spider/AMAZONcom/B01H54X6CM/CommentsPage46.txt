I love these 40/50s style dresses. Fits like a glove, mid-calf. Very close fitting but stretchy. I bought a size S. I am 5'2, 109lbs for reference and wear a US size 4.


Although the fabrics and dress is made extremely well... I have to give it a low score because it came soiled with deodorant stains under the armpit... I am so disappointed because I have purchased from this company before.


I liked the prices, cut and style.  Fabric was nice and had a lot of spandex material.  I ordered based on what the Size chart measurements table said but it ran small.  I did not want to order a larger size.


I love this dress. I'm a size 14, 16 if I indulge too much. I ordered a size XL. It fit perfectly. It's great for work and a nice dinner date. I liked it so much that I ordered it another color.


Looks and fits great! 4 stars because Iâ€™m not chesty enough to fill it out. Which that part was more adaptable to smaller or larger breast.


I can get in the dress (my normal size) but it is too tight to wear comfortable out, in public. Otherwise, it is pretty and shows off my curves. My husband likes it. ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼ğŸ˜‹


Beautiful dress especially for the price. Itâ€™s a thick material so it is flattering. I received a lot of Compliments on the dress. I ordered It in 3 different colors peach, green and gray. I felt that the gray was the most flattering.


Beautiful color, good quality material with the right amount of stretch. I bought this for work but I would definitely wear it to dinner with the girls as well. It's sexy yet classy.


I read a lot of reviews before ordering this. I personally think the quality was crap and returned it. Like others said, the piece of material on the shoulder just doesn't work!


I loved the way this dress fit my body. I purchased a medium, thinking it would be a little snug, but it worked out just right. I wore the dress to my friend's wedding in Houston and it was perfect for the warm weather there too. Looking forward to purchasing a similar dress from the same brand and the price can't be beat. Definitely give the dress "two enthusiastic thumbs up" ğŸ˜‰.
