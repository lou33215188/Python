can't wait to wear it for my anniversary


Beautiful dress! I ordered a size medium and it fits perfect. I received endless compliments! I think I will order this dress in a different color!


Go ahead and buy this dress! It's absolutely beautiful and well fitted. I will be honest this dress is for a person with curves. It will flatter you in all the right ways. You'll be turning heads like Christina Hendricks in Mad Men.


Very chic and comfortable.  A bit snug but will keep.


Sex zip bad shape


Dress is extremely thin not what I expected! !!!


Great dress with stretchy material but is not true to size. Runs small.


Good material for price, it wasn't too thin like some dresses you get from ordering online. Overall happy with the dress!


As it's pictured!


This dress was such a disappointment. It is made out of very cheap material and the color is so faded like a used item. I couldn't even wear it. My husband told me to give it away to the needy, and that is what I did
