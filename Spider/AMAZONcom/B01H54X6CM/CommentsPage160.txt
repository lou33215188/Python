Great dress for an hourglass shape.


This dress is just what I wanted! Fits right, good quality, and it's beautiful.


Way smaller than expected

Love this dress


Ordered small but it was too big on me and I didn't like the material that much....


This dress is big for its size. I am 5'4 and 100 lbs and ordered a small. It swallowed me whole. The bust of the dress would only fit a D cup, which is odd considering it is a small. The shoulders were also strangely wide. This is certainly more flattering to broader, curvier type babes.
