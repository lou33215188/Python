Love this dress. True to size


This dress fit, however, looks different in real time.  Will return.


This dress is gorgeous, it fits like a glove...would buy again


Beautiful dress!  I cannot wait to wear it.  It's a traffic stopper!!!!  ;-)


Nice dress fit a little snug and I like the other one that I ordered better so I'm returning this one.


Perfect fit, not too tight but showed the curves.


I'm so in love, love, love with this dress. I bought the navy blue medium it was a perfect fit.
