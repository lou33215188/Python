Love this dress.. 5'4" 115 lbs ... fits my waits without any gaps.. perfect


I now have these in a couple different colors. Very flattering and super comfy!


I like the dress, Nice giving material, but still sized a bit on the small size.  Large fits like a medium. Sized more like European rather than US


I love this dress! THIS IS RED. It's long enough for tall girls like me, and it fits VERY well. Thank you!


Love it!


Fits like a glove. Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€� and 138lbs and got a small in the white and it was perfect. Iâ€™m a 36DD and the chest wasnâ€™t too constricting like I thought it might be with being a small. Great purchase!


Love it! Comfortable, stylish & perfect for the occasion I need it for.ğŸ˜Š


Very nice, fits perfectly. This one fit me quit snug so I intend to wear shaping under garments, so that you cannot see EVERYTHING. Other than that I am happy with the dress and quality.


Came as expected.  Fit great. A bit see-through, but I will wear a white slip dress under it.


Dress is a little more fitted than expected but is a great dress.
