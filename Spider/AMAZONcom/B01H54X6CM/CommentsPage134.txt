Well made and it looks as I expected.


The fabric looks cheap but the dress fits well. Color is a little washed out


The way it fit, and I received a lot of complements on to the dress. Would buy again in another color.


I love this dress so much I bought it in another color.


Way too small and it looked very wrinkled, the creases in it didn't look like creases once it was put on


Not bad but I am not thrilled with the material.


Super happy with this dress. Needed a little adjustment to the shoulder, but an easy fix. Fits perfectly and is very comfortable!


I love this dress. I'm 5'1 and weigh 110 lbs. I bought a small and it fits perfectly!


This is a must have for someone with curves.


The dress was nice my daughter really liked it.
