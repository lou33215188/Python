Beautiful fabric but it runs very small ,it was too tight on my hips I couldn't walk, if you are a pear shape lady like me ,you should go up one size. The length was perfect it fell below my knees & I'm 5'4 . I might reorder it,because it is a beautiful dress.


Nice stylish little black dress!


Pretty Dress love the design, but no where near American Size way to tight.


Love it, fits true to size. I weight 180lbs and I am 5'5. I ordered a Large and it fits perfect. I have lots of butt and hips. I would order again in another color.


Iâ€™d give this dress a 4.8 out of 5. One small flaw at the shoulder/neckline if you have a full bust. I love this dress and got a lot of compliments on it.


The dress is cute and flattering. My only complaint is that the inner panel over the breast doesn't stay in place.


I loved the way this dress fit.


Love this dress, I looked amazing in it!!!


Was a little tighter than I expected. Also hard to iron. But when I was able to press it adequately, the size was O.K. As long as I don't gain a pound it will be fine. Nice looking dress for the price.


Love the dress, the fabric is stretchy but I wish the style held shape a little more, I was self-conscious about the folds doing their own thing the entire night and the collar wouldn't stay. Gorgeous dress but awkward fit
