Love this dress! Fit perfectly, hides everything even though it's body hugging. Great color. Thick material.


Nice material. The right strap does not stay on


THIs dress is hot for the office but classy.


The fit of the dress.....classy chic and flirty


This dress is a stunner.  I was hesitant to purchase given the $30 price tag but don't be fooled - the quality is top notch!  I am 5 6" and 123lbs and the SM fit like a glove.


The material is very thick so it really keeps it's shape, doesn't seem to wrinkle.  It fit just as expected and is very lovely!


I love this dress, perfect fit.


Beautiful fit!


Got a lot of compliments on this dress. Material is good and not see through or itchy. Does have some stretch to it.


I purchased this dress for my graduation because the information stated the dress was white. However, when I received the dress I noticed it was CREAM!. I was very disappointed. The dress however fit perfectly as I ordered the MEDIUM for my 5ft 2.2" 146lbs body type. If I had to purchase again, I will definitely purchase this style of dress but definitely a different colour. Because of the false advertising of the dress being white but in reality it is  cream/ off white, I am giving a (4star) rating. The feel of the material and the elegant fit is the only reason I have not returned this dress.
