Tried it on someone small period but I'm also 6 feet tall period And I weigh 140 pounds.


I am going to buy one in every color that suits me.  Fits perfectly.  I'm going to also see what else this brand offers.  I'm petite, and Asian clothing brands like this just fit me perfectly.


Classic styling.  Great neckline.  Well-made with durable fabric.  Very nice quality.  I expect this dress to last for many years.


this dress is actually nice.  It's just as you see it, but I had to return it, did not like the color and I ordered it 1 size too big.  But it fits snugged, so order accordingly.


Beautiful dress but have to have hemmed, not for short people. I'm 5"4, and it was about 3 to 4 inches past my knees.


Love this dress! It's extremely flattering and the color (purple) is beautiful. I'm impressed that the fabric is good quality and comfortable. This is a great deal. I plan on ordering in other colors.


I LOVE this dress.  I did have to have it hemmed because I’m only 5’2” and I wanted it to hit just below the knee.  I got this dress in the green color and it is so vibrant and beautiful. Looks so much more expensive than it was.


Great quality and beautiful.  I washed and dried this twice now and still holding up great. I am 5'9" 135 lbs and a small fit perfectly.


I normally wear a 18/20 and get a 2x dress, but I order this in 3x and it's a too form fitting.  Have to keep pushing it down every 10 steps.  Just inspiration to lose a few pounds.


love this dress, fits great, extremely flattering, sexy but doesn't give away the farm. Could wear to multiple occasions, dress up or down with different accessories.
