The shoulder / bust area a bit loose, fells like a tad too much fabric in the back, around the zipper and it is too long. You may need to consider putting a height range on dresses, I am 5"2'.


I'm very pleased thanks I just wish the delivery person would make sure to knock n wait for min before they just leave it out front almost miss him  but dress is awesome

Ordered a medium. Measurements are 38,28,38. Fit like a glove. Super flattering.


Gorgeous dress!


So great I'll be buying another on another color.


Excellent dress for this price.  Fits lovely, very flattering.  I ordered the black and I am about to order the yellow.  The material is very sturdy.


With this dress you will look both, sweet and a bombshell!!!


Got lots of compliments when I wore it at my nephew's wedding!  It came the day of the wedding, so I was ecstatic!  The dress accentuated what little curves I had!


Not my kind of dress
