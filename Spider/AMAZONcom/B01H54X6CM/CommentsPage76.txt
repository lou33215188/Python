I order this dress for my wife and she loves it! It fits perfectly. Good material and it hug her curves perfectly. She just had a baby, so it hide her lose skin. She told me she felt confident again. Best choice.


The dress is pretty I have a problem with the pleats


They do not stay tact once you put the dress on


Elegant.....


Good quality


Looked great, but another dress won out.


Fits well. Well made. I received several compliments on the dress. I need one in every color.


Love  The material of this dress. It is a nice consistency and it is not sheer. I also love the way it fits my figure I am glad I ordered the size that I did


This is a beautiful dress. I bought it in white, but I need it in every color! Bought and XL and I'm a 14 dress with huge boobs, but the dress accommodated them and didn't squish them flat.


Looooove this dress. Will be buying in other colors. Buy it!!!!


I normally wear a size 6 but purchased a large. From past experiences I know dresses purchased that were made in China run small. So did it fit as expected? Yes because I expected it to run small.
