I'm 5,7 and 140lb bought size medium based on the reviews and it fits like a glove. I will get it hemmed just above the knee but I knew I the length when I bought it. Really happy with the stretchy material and the quality.


fit is fabulous.  very nice item.  will buy again in other colors


Beautiful fit, I am 5'9, 137 lbs, hourglass shape, this fit beautifully. Navy is true to the pictures. Not a huge fan of the lines in the ruching, but that's a personal preference. It's a bit tight overall but not so much so that I would feel uncomfortable wearing it to a professional event or to work. I expect to get this same dress in about 4 more colors!


Love this dress.  Very form fitting which I expected.  I would buy it in other colors.


i really liked this dress, next time i will order it in a small instead of a medium and in several shades, it really stretches


The dress is so forgiving. It is flattering for many figures. I thought it would make me look shorter because I am only 5'2" and thought the longer cut would make me look stumpy. I was wrong. It was beautiful and effortless. Love it!


I READ A FEW REVIEWS SAYING YOU SHOULD ORDER A SIZE LARGER.  I THINK YOU NEED TO ORDER A SIZE SMALLER SINCE IT IS A STRETCHY MATERIAL.  ALSO A BEAUTIFUL DRESS FOR THE PRICE


I ABSOLUTELY love this dress!  It is stretchy but not so much it doesn't hold "everything" in. I feel so sexy when I wear this dress! I'm 5'10 and it falls below my knees, which is exactly what I wanted. I followed the size chart and ordered accordingly and it fits perfect. This is my favorite dress.


I thought that it was going to be larger than it was, and I even ordered a size too big for me. These sizes run very small.


Material was heavier than I expected, very nice dress at an excellent price.
