I read the reviews to make sure I ordered the right size.  I'm 130 pounds, 5' 4", so I purchased a small.  It fit pretty good, but the torso section is unforgiving if you get bloated or have a nice meal - LOL!  The color wasn't as bright as I had expected, it's really more of a burgundy color.


Good quality size was smaller than chart


Love love love! It was a bit lose in the chest area but based on the measurements I was prepared for that!


The dress is very cute, however it was just a little too form fitting for preferences for office attire.  I returned it.


Beautiful dress, but it's cut bit small.  I wear a small, and I am 119lbs.  This dress fits nice on the top but the bottom area is very narrow.  I know its a pencil dress, buy the bottom of this one is extremely narrow.  I returned it.


Very Classy! Fits perfect, figure flattering. I am 5'2" 120 pounds, busty' with small hips  I got size Small...a bit longer than I would normally wear, but it's a classic!


Great color.


Beautiful dress. Fits like a glove. The fabric at first seems like it's not great but it is actually really nice for hiding imperfections. Love this dress and highly recommend it. It is a little on the smaller side. I'm about 132 pounds and almost 5'8. The medium is a little tight for what I usually like but I think it is suppose to be snuge so it works. I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress!


Ordered a size larger then I usually do, and thank goodness I did.  It fit and looked amazing.  Wore it for my fathers funeral calling hours since we had a blue theme.  It was comfy, looked slimming and I was felt good wearing it.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but size up.  Slimming but very nice.


I am 5"2 130pds. Cup is a B and I ordered a large. Measurements 34" top, 31" waist, and 42" hips/bottoms. Back picture and leg length picture provided. Great purchase. Blazer for winter and dress by itself for the summer.
