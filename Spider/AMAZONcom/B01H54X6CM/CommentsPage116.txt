Very beautiful dress. I loved it! Will buy in other colors.


Love the style and quality is good too


Bought this dress in gray. 198lbs so I got the dress in a large it fit perfect! Nice stretchy durable and comfortable material. Will buy in more colors and recommend to friends and family.


The medium fit a little snug for a size 4 but was a little small on top for a 34C. If I were a little more well-endowed, I probably would have kept it.


This dress ran small I had to return it


For the price, you can't beat this dress. Looks and feels great on.


Just worries about how it will hold up to being cleaned


I ordered in 2 sizes I'm usually a 10 in numbered sizes and a large in lettered so I am very happy with the product fits beautifully.


like the look of it but it was a little tight


Love this


Classy!
