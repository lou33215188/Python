Fits very well. am 215lbs and I bought the xl.


Dress fits great. Delivered in timely fashion.


You need to order bigger size. Disappointed in this sizing.


My third muxxn dress love it.... fits perfect


Runs small, but nice dress.  It was more off white than the white that I needed.


I love the style.


Cheap fabric no lining so you can see through, and the fit is terrible


I love the way it fit


Totally disappointed in this purchase. I ordered a medium size and came extra large.


Everything that I was hoping for and with just enough stretch to make it a perfect fit. Love it!
