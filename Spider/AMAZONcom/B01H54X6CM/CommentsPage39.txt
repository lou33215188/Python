Great fit! Looks fabulous on. I received a lot of compliments. Has some stretch, so it fit great and not tight. I liked it so much, I purchased it in yellow too.


Iâ€™m 5â€™7 and normally wear a size 12-14 dress however in this dress a 2x fit. The dress does not look like the photo. The pleats are unfinished and just make the dress look wrinkled. The shoulder straps are misplaced so good luck finding a bra to wear under this thing. I will be returning this dress.


First off the price was excellent ğŸ‘�ğŸ�½The fabric of the dress was perfect ğŸ‘Œ It gave me a fit like a bodycon dress I will be ordering another one in a size large so I can wear my spank underneath I do go up and down with my weight. I am 5/7 and my weight is 160. As for care of the dress I hand washed it in cold water and let it dry hanging and the perfect touch afterwards was using my garment steamer.


I loveeee this dress... the dress came in time for my event.  I read the reviews.. and followed the recommendations. I'm 5'4 175lbs.. 36dd curvy hips.. let me tell you.. I took it out of the package... lawdy  Jesus... I thought it was going to be to big.... I put it on.. and it molded right to my shape..super glad I made the right choice.. I ordered a large. No pics yet.. I'll update after my event.


Yasssss!  I am a thick, curvy badass - 5'4", 220lb - with more body than most sexy dresses allow for, but this hugs all the right places and makes me look as awesome as I feel.  The XL I ordered is a solid fit without making the zipper strain, and though the weird excess fabric at the neckline is a little distracting, it's nothing some quick tacking can't fix.


I love the dress. It clings to you and is very nice for the figure. I ordered a medium at first but then ordered the large. The medium was a little tight. I love the dress can't wait to wear it. Very sexy. Glad I don't have to pay to send things back. I got the purple. Love it.


Nicely made dress. Very figure flattering and form-fitting. Length is the perfect pencil style dress just below the knees. Would probably purchase another one in another color.


Gorgeous dress for my Christmas work party. Just the slightest bit loose above the bust, but with a light cover, you couldn't even tell. I will probably alter and wear again.


Love it!  There is a piece at the neck that keeps sticking out. It's a bit annoying, but the dress looks good on me. I can live with it. Makes your waist look snatched! It would be 5 stars if it weren't for that neck like.
