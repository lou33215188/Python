Fits great...


It's not for short people.


Perfect


I LOVE this dress! I bought it as my wedding dress, as we had a small wedding. Fit perfect ! I just might buy another in a different color for work !


I loved my dress. It came exactly as it was portrayed in the picture and it fitted perfectly. Well worth the purchase.


Fits perfect! I am 5'8 140 lbs, the length hit the knee, extremely classy dress. love, just purchased another one :)


SOmewhat large on the midsection but fits everywhere else slightly awkwardly shaped


First, the positives ….and there are not many:


1) Deep emerald green color. It is quite pretty;


2) The thick stretchy fabric. The dress is not lined, but the fabric does not require it.

Now the negatives:


1) Awful cut that has multiple flaws. The breast inner flap won't stay in place. The folds in the breast area look all right, but the ones on the stomach are done in the worst possible place. I have a flat stomach and this dress made me look almost pregnant. To make it worse the folds do not face down but up, which makes your stomach look even bigger;


2) The fabric is very stretchy and it makes the dress fit way larger than the size description. I usually wear size 8 dress and large was too big on me.


3) The length is too long too. I am 5"10 and it was way past my knee.


I am returning it:(


Beautiful dress,  looks great


Has lots of stretch but looks like it needs a good pressing perfect in the hips a little big in the bust and shoulders
