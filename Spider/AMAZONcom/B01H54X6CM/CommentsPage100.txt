Gorgeous dress... very figure flattering.


Normally a size 16 ordered a XL and it fit perfectly. I am so excited to wear for my college graduation! Love the material especially.


Zipper broke on the day of a very special event.  Very disappointed and would never purchase again.


i LOVED THE DRESS.. IT WAS JUST TO BIG FOR ME.. MADE WELL - VERY COMFORTABLE, JUST A LITTLE BIG FOR ME


I LOVED THE COLORS THEY OFFER AND I WILL BE PURCHASING ANOTHER ONE..


This dress is absolutely beautiful. Fits perfectly! Love it!


I absolutely love this dress, and it fits perfect to size!


This dress fit very nicely.  I am 5'5" and 107 lbs, I wish I could have ordered an XS but that was not an option.  I had to return it because the dress hit 4 inches below the bottom of my knee. The upper portion of the dress was very flattering.  If the dress was at my knee as advertised I would have kept it. The dress is form fitting without being overly tight.  the fabric is thick and feels good.  I think this dress is a good value for $30-$45, you are getting a well made dress for the $30 -$50 price range, keep in mind it is not over $100.


Itâ€™s a very nice dress. However, it was a little smaller than I expected it to be.


I love the fit, but I should have gone up one more size. I'm a nice solid and curvy size 16 and purchased a size  2X.  So to all you curvy ladies out there, overall it's worth the purchase.


Great construction and quality material.  It's somewhat stretchy so it's very comfortable.  Perfect cocktail dress.
