My Wife loved this dress. Nice material and fits perfect!  will be buying a few more


Love the dress, good quality & it fit me perfectly!


I ordered the black option. I am very impressed with the quality of the fabric,  it seems well made, and the fit is the best part. Will definitly look to buy more from this vendor.


This dress is beautiful. Make sure if you get the white one to have seamless white or nude underwear or you can see them. I love how it fits, it conforms to the body perfectly.


Dress fit perfect for my body type. Really brings out my curves. Received many compliments. Stretchy so worked out perfect since I'm curvy from hips and butt area.


Fits very nicely,  much better than expected. I'm usually a size 8 and am 5'5. Would highly recommend this.


The fabric is nice and thick and stretchy which is what I wanted. The length is perfect also. I'm 5'2" 110 lbs and size S was just right.


Perfect fit for my petite frame with DDs breasts. I'm 5'2 , 117lbs and medium is my size in all of MUXXN's dresses.


beautiful


Vava voom!
