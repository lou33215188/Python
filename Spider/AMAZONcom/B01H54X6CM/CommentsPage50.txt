This dress if very flattering and slim fitting.  If you are curvy it is fabulous!!  It is very comfortable.  I would highly recommend it!


Love this dress! I justed ordered 4 more in different colors. Fit well. Material does not feel cheap. Got lots of compliments. Like other reviews, the shoulder  is a bit loose but not a big deal


I returned this because it was wayyy too tight. So not quite TTS. Runs slightly small. The fabric is thick and doesn’t have a lot of give. Wish I could have kept it though!


This dress is a knockout! Use the size chart, its spot on! I wore a small and I'm 5'9, 135lbs, athletic build. The small fit like a glove. I am ordering in other colors. NOTE: the yellow is see through...you will need a slip!!


Fits like a glove...it hugs your curves and is stretchy.  Beautiful color


I like it but definitely has to be hemmed. 5 2' 112lbs 34c I got small


Beautiful dress I think a dress everyone should have. Love this dress.


It is a little sheer so put your under garments carefully. Nice material.  Nice fit. I bought 2 of them!


Dress was gorgeous but it definitely ran small. I had to send it back.


This dress is absolutely stunning! I often buy online and am disappointed with the cheap material I receive. This is NOT the case with this dress! It cinches a bit and lays nice. I love it so much I ordered it in black as well! This is a very classy dress and is priced very reasonably. For the record, I am 5’9” and 125 pounds. I ordered a medium. Would buy it in every color if I needed to!
