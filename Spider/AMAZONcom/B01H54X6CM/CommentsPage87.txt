Great dress. Good quality, perfect for a classy event or fun night out. Very flattering.


The color is beautiful, but it fits so small & should be returned


My wife loves it. Great fit and she had many compliments from co-workers asking if it was a designer outfit.


Perfection-love the cut, the color, and the fit! Going to buy more dresses from this company!


I have A## and Hip!! This Dress fits and hits me in EVERY place thats  it should! Sexxy Sexxy


love it


Fits well, the cut and design are both very nice, but the material is hard.  I have not yet wash it, maybe it will soften after wash, but I just hope it won't shrink...


I really like the way the dress fits! I think I could've went up in a size. I ordered a medium and mu husband loves the way it fits. I'm 5'3" 145 lbs with hips.


Lovely
