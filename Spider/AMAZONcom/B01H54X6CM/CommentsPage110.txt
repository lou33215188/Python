Nice dress, however XXL is more like a size 12-14


A medium was a little small , but other than that It's nice , material and all.


This dress made me feel incredible! I will agree with a previous review, because I have a full bust there was a bit of fabric that stuck out on top, but otherwise, it was perfect.


Very fitted.


I am 33 weeks pregnant and needed something to wear for a white party. The medium was a perfect fit.


Only because it didn't fit me I thought a medium would guess I needed an extra small but I did give it to my cousin and it looks great on her so maybe u should get 4stars


Beautifully fits


Cute dress but has some annoying extra fabric on the chest area that creeps up during wear. Other than that it's a great dress


It is a great fit and has nice lines.


The fabric is a little lightweight so you need to wear an undergarment for certain.


I purchased an XL.  I wear a 6.  It was PERFECT!  I love it!
