I bought this for a cruise...the little black dress.....BEWARE IT RUNS VERY VERY SMALL !!!!!!!!


I take a size 6/8 - I ordered a Medium.....could not zip it up......


Nice color, material not heavy but not too thin, and gives a little. I read reviews about a small flap in the front neck part that might come up. I did notice it but I don't think its anything a quick pin won't fix. The fit is good


Hot dress! Not for work though....


I ordered this dress for an outdoor wedding and I loved it!  It was really comfortable and it looked good! I am tall and the dress came down to my knees which I thought was great. Received many compliments!


Great fit, feel and look. Love it!


I will have to either lose five pounds or wear  spanx to fit into this dress!


It is beautiful


Very nice dress. Good quality material as well.


like the other buyers the flap in the front did not stay down, very annoying, tried on and returned next day.


Love the dress but disliked that it's recommended to be dry cleaned and it arrived folded tightly in a bag so I'll have to have it dry cleaned to get the wrinkles out before I can wear it.
