Really nice dress, fits perfectly.  Good quality material.


The color is beautiful and the material very good.  The length is perfect for me too. Very pleased with this purchase


Great!


Great dress. I gave 4 stars as opposed to 5 because the belly around could've been a mite bit tighter.


I love ‚ù§ the material of this dress,  the fit was perfect. I would definitely recommend this to anyone


Just not very flattering, and a little see through


My wife loves it!


I am not the perfect size therefore I had to buy a little bigger (size large) and then had my seamstress do the adjustments.  I love the dress.  My only issue is that the dress is not white as stated, the colour is more of an off white.


The dress fit exactly like I hoped it would and hugged my curves. I cant express how unbelievably happy I was with this purchase.


Loving it!
