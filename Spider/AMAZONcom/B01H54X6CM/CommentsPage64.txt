The dress fits nice and has a good stretch and is thick enough,but the material is kind of coarse. Other than that, good.

Beautiful dress. Fit well. Top part was a little big but fit well overall.


Love!!! I am 5'8, 36-30-36. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. The material is nice and thick. Very happy


I ordered a medium per the reviews. I am 5'6 and 125 lbs. and the fit was Ok but a little too big and the dress was past my knees! Definitely too long for me... not sure if a small would be any shorter.


Got compliments wearing this dress - it looks fabulous!


I LIKE IT


This dress is very flattering hugging and insinuating all of my curves love it. Fyi I purchased a medium size. I am 5,5 150 lbs stretchy material. Good quality!


Great dress, very flattering fit. Fits as per the size chart.


I am returning because, though it does fit, it's very, very tight.  I bought the 2x and measurements are 40, 45, 40.  Also, the neckline doesn't lay quite flat.


LOVE THIS DRESS!!!!
