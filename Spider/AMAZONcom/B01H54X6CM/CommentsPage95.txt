Awesome dress


THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL DRESS BUT WAS TOO SMALL AND THE COLOR WAS NOT A WHITE WHITE, IT WAS MORE  LIKE A OFF WHITE. I WILL ORDER ANOTHER ONE  BUT IN A DIFFERENT COLOR AND SIZE.


I order xl it was tight. When, i walk it walk.


I think I needed 2x.


But it worked


This dress looks very sexy on model and some people. I bought the right size for me but couldn't understand why the right shoulder peace is not staying on my shoulder, sliding down, like was made too big. Send it back.


Very flattering.


Nice feel, but the top of the dress was very large, like made for a large bust. I'm a size 8 and c cup ordered a large and it was too big.


Gorgeous color, great but not perfect fit. I returned the lighter blue because the rumbling in the back shows up more.great fabric.


Love it. I ordered a XL. I wear a 12/14 in dresses


Love it fit perfect
