This dress was true to size, and very flattering on my body. I would highly recommend to anyone, and will definitely check out othere dresses from this company.


I wore the second dress on a seperate occasion. And the bottom seam began to unravel.


Runs true to size, but too thin and I'll fitting looks cheap.


This dress is beautiful the quaality is perfect but there is a major problem it has no inner lining and that is horibble. Your underwear is literally showing. However you can wear tank and undershorts to help with that problem


I love it great quality not see through and I received lots of complements on the dress.


A must buy.


My body was the problem, not the dress, could have handled my stomach, but there was zero hiding of the thighs. Nice material again, not too heavy, bigger size wont help, this fabric is absolutely unforgiving. Good luck!


It was a gift for my girlfriend and I loved it


Sexy and classy, thick fabric will keep you warm!


This dress is the bomb.com!!!! I love it.. Igot so many compliments while wearing it... I am about 5'2'' and around 135lbs.... 34DD cup and the Medium fit me perfectly!!! I will be ordering another dress from this company!!!


Material was not what I expected. It fit though. It'll work for what I bought it for.


Not true to size. Ordered a 18W and it was more like a size 8. Very disappointed.
