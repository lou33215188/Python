Really nice quality. Fits well.


Love this dress. Fit great and got many compliments on it. I got it in Navy and was very pleased with the color too. Would buy again in a different color!


Love the color, love the fit..


Love the MUXXN dresses


I love this dress and I think it is my new absolute favorite dress ever.  It very flattering.  I suggesting any woman who wants to feel sexy to make this purchase ASAP.


The dress was a little big from the shoulders, but not by too much.  I was able to make the alterations on the shoulders.  Other than that, the dress wraps perfectly around my body.  I am very happy with this dress.


You get what u see size is true to match


This dress is feminine. Fabulous bold color. Wonderful stretchy fabric. I am very happy with this dress even though it took me a minute to decide if I liked the runching on the waist


Love it. It looks great on. It runs a bit small in my opinion.  Had to send it back and get a larger size.  I'm 5'5 169 and had to get a XXL


OMG, what a beautiful dress.  From the color to the cut to the fit to the material.  It's perfect all around.  I'm a size 6 and I'm 5'4" and it fits perfectly,  It looks tight but doesn't feel tight.  It's a very elegant dress.  Highly recommend it.
