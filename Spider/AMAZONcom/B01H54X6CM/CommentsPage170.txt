Loved it


Love this dress. Perfect fit, its comfortable to wear


Fit like a dream


There is no texture to the dress and the material is a bit odd.  Can't get it to looked wrinkle free.  the material is thick and at first glance appears pretty nice, but once you tried it on something is just off.  Not sure if it is the quality of the material or just how it is sewn.  So ended up returning it.


It will show every bump you have.  Down to the smallest wrinkle!  If you aren't confident, you won' t be able to pull it off no matter what your size.


Love the dress!! Really hugs your curves!!


Love love this dress


I (the guy) give it 5 stars. She gives it a 1. Simple math works out to an average of 3. Super cute and fit nice, which we both liked, but it's BY GAWD SEE THROUGH, which I loved but she didn't care for. You can't please everybody!


I purchased this dress for an upcoming event and was so excited to have found it after reading the reviews and images. I am so dissatisfied and disappointed as what was shipped is completely a different dress than the images show. Now with only a couple of days left before my event I am scrambling to find an alternate..


Very nice dress. Got tons of compliments. Very comfortable


Great fit
