Pretty color and stretch material works well.  Had to order a larger size.


Beautiful dress; cannot wait to wear it!


I love it fits like a glove


The dress is great. The thread to hold it together is a little cheap and got a hole in it after 2 wears. I still like it


I love the dress. It fits my body really well but fit big at top. I ordered a size xl. It has some stretch to it and the material is really nice. Order a Size smaller if you don't have big breast


The dress is great quality and fits wonderfully!


This is a nice dress and the colour is beautiful.  I gave it


 3 stars because the dress does nothing for me.  If you don't have much hips, don't purchase this dress.  Other than that it's a perfect dress.


I am usually skeptical about buying yellow colors on line because you are not sure what shade you will end up with but I was not disappointed this a lovely banana yellow dress that is of great quality and fits superb will be buying more from this line. I'm 5'10 & 120lbs.


Received compliments the entire night at the my son's school function.


Fit a little small compared to some of the other dresses I ordered. I will return this but for the price it is a nice dress and seems to be well made.
