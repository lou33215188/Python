Love!


Perfect fit. It has a nice stretch to it.


Love, love, love it! My wife loves the dresses and it was exactly as she expected.


I'm about 5'8 and 137 lbs.  They were all out of the medium, which is what I would have originally ordered, so I took a chance on the small. It's definitely fitting, but if you are pretty firm everywhere this may still work for you. I decided to return it for the large since they were still out of the medium and the large fits good.  It's a very comfortable lightweight dress and I like the style a lot.  However, as some other reviewers mentioned,  there is a flap inside the dress that goes across the bust that sometimes moves up towards the neckline a bit. It's kind of weird how it lays.  I wish they would have just added  little more material and made it a shelf bra. That would have been awesome.  It's a great price for the dress, but I may take it to my Taylor to see if he can do something with that flap.  If not then I may have to return that one because that flap will just but me if I have to keep making sure it stays in.


Great little dress, did not cost a lot work to evening with a change of hair do


Loved the fit, but they should really fix the weird flap around the collar.


The material was cheap


Love the dress. It looks great on.
