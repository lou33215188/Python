I purchased The dark green.  The color was great and exactly what I was expecting.  The fabric is nice but not to heavy so it's very comfortable. I am 5'10" and was a little nervous about the length but it was perfect. It does snug your body so be mindful of your under garments.


5 perfect stars...fit is wonderful, length is appropriate, material is fabulous.  I'm 5'4" 130lbs with an athletic frame and this dress gave me curves.  It is sexy yet modest at the same time.  I plan on wearing it to a quinceanera.  I will be buying more colors!!!


I was a bit afraid it would be too small sine it seemed to be oriental sizing but the small fit my 5'4" 120 lb frame perfectly.  My only complaint would be that the front placard keeps rolling up and there doesn't seem to be a way to tack it down.


Dress fits, I Love the color and the texture. I course the size runs small.


I originally purchased this dress in yellow. I loved it and decided to get a white one. I am 5'8" and weigh about 160. The large fit perfectly. The material is stretchy and sort of keeps you from giggling. Almost like support undergarments.


I absolutely love this dress, it fits perfectly to size!


I love the way it fits. Very sexy dress.


Really nice dress, was a bit too big on the bust and waist. Overall a very cute dress


poor quality fabric.


It was fine, just too tight for my look.
