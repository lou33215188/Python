nice material.  i'm an 8/10 and ordered a large and the center draping just didn't sit right.  neither did the square one arm thing.


Bought the green one for my mom, Nice material, great color. One of the armholes was smaller that the other one so she had to paid to fix it.


Conservative yet sexy. I love the material. It shows off you God given curves yet it covers your breast if you are wanting coverage.


This dress...the attention I got from this dress...I was not expecting that. LOL. It fits too well.


So, Cute. It's the color and fit I've been looking for. I'm so surprised how great the material feels for the price I paid. Will shop with you again!! Extremely satisfied.


i love this dress, love the design, whenever i wear it everyone loved it


Super hugging material but still flattering. Shows every curve and every flaw, so have on the right under garments. Beware of the VPL!


I could not believe the quality of the material of this dress considering the low price! Will wear this dress in April to a wedding!


I love this dress!!! Wore for a fundraiser and now to a wedding. People I did not know where coming up asking where I got it! I'm 5'4 160, bought a large.


cute dress for the price, but the size is odd & so is the cut of the dress and longer than I would prefer given that I am 5'4 and would have liked it to be above my knee.
