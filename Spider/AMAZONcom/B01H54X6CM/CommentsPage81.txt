This is a gorgeous dress....can’t wait to wear it to a wedding in May.


I love this dress! fits great, material is awesome (stretchy, not stiff), great color.


This dress is absolutely gorgeous.


It was way too long for my 5'3 self.  The material felt a bit stiff on the legs, but somewhat  fitted at the chest.  Overall,  material was a little more stiff than I expected.  Looks great on the girls who posted pictures.  However, it was not a good dress for me.


beautiful dress for the price


very nice fabric fits very nice


amazing fit!!! very sexy elegant and comfortable!!i am 5'5 115 lb got small one and it is perfect ! goes for any occasion


Fits very nice. I’m 5’3” and 128 lbs. I ordered a small in navy blue and I thought it would be too long and it wasn’t. It wasn’t thin material or see through either. Came folded nicely in package. So I just needed to steam it a bit with iron.


Beautiful dress. I weigh 140, I am 5'6" and a 34C bra size. The medium fit great.


Loved the color and the material of this dress. Needed it for a gala for domestic violence awareness so the shade of purple was just right! I purchased a large but think a medium would've been fine as well. All in all, I'm quite satisfied with the purchase.
