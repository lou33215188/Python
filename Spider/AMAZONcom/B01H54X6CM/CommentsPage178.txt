The material is good strong quality.  Fits beautiful


fits as expected


After reading the reviews and the size chart I went with a medium! Terrible plan! This thing is like a tent and the dress is not cut for someone slim. Even a size smaller size would still make a smaller person look chunky. Returning promptly.


Great dress and price!!!


Very thin fabric, yolk/facing on top covers well, the rest of the dress is revealing


Absolutely perfect


Love this dress. Can't wait for Valentine day.  Fits like a glove and has forgiveness if u go a size smaller.


This earns one star. This item is the sizes smaller. My niece who wears a size twelve could bake for this dress. The material is fine.


it is big for me.


Love it
