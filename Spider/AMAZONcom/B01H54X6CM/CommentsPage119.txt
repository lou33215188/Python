I liked the dress, but it was too too small. It was not a xl.


Nice design and contour but did not like the material. Felt like I was wearing a cardboard dress. Not comfortable to wear.


Very flattering and cute dress.  It is stretchy but made to fit tight.


Great dress. As described and great material. I ordered my usual size which is a medium and fits perfect not too tight or too big


The perfect fit! I will definitely get additional dresses in navy and red


The dress fit perfectly, my only complaint was the extra piece of fabric on the bust area.


It appeared to be a nice looking dress. However it wasn't for my body type. Returned.


I'm a size 8 and it was skin tight for a medium.


I am 5'5 143lbs and I ordered a medium in the yellow and it fit perfect. I received some many compliments! I will definitely be ordering another color soon.
