Great dress, comfortable, and good quality material.


I love it!! Great dark green color! I ordered a med and it fit perfect. Super fast shipping! I will be sure and order another color when I need a new dress.


Not impressed and the actual dress looks cheap

I really liked the dress. However, it was tttoo tight. I would have reordered but, they did not have the size I knew I needed once I tried the dress on.


This is a fabulous dress.  The fit is perfect and I am 5'8" and ordered the medium.  Very very flattering dress.


I purchased this dress in black after looking at quite a large number of dresses.  It arrived nicely packaged, not damaged.  I tried it on and it does really hug except for the zipper creating a "bump" at the small of my back.  For reference, I am 5'5", 34DDD, wear size XS/S with nice curves.  I loved that it accentuated my hips and rear and that I did not feel that my bust was crushed by the top but even the small size seemed too big at just my waist - it fit very well everywhere else.  The other issue I had (which other reviewers mentioned) was that it was way too long for me.  I was hoping it would hit just below the knee but when I pulled it down to eliminate the zipper "bump", it was to mid-calf.  It does seem to be well-made and that it would be very comfortable for longer wear but it was just not for me.


This dress is gorgeous and fit like a glove. Only issues was that it was somewhat see through but a slip under would fix that
