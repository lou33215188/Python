I love the cut, and the color. The only issue I had is that I had to keep pulling it down all night. I liked that it was a longer length.


I usually buy from this brand but this dress the zipper was broken.


Love this dress!


The flap in the front of the dress doesn't stay put, but I overlooked it. Awesome fit


Haven't written it yet but was pleased on the fit!! ğŸ’¯ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾


Dress was as expected! The fabric did not feel "cheap." Wore for Easter Sunday and felt classy. I am 5'3 and 105#, the small fit well and the hem was slightly below my knees.


My picture speaks for itself.


I had to return it, becuse my boobs didn't fit in it. I really wish it had fit though!


Dress looks good but was a little longer than expected


I am so impressed at how comfortable the fabric is and exact the size was. I followed the size chart to pick my size.. I do suggest you do the same. It was spot on.


Nice dress! Fit perfectly. Loved the coral color.  I'm about a dress size 2-4 and the small worked out great. I recommend sizing up you have a little more curves. Dress was very wrinkled but after steaming looked great!
