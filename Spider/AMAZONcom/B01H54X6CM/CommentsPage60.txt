Absolutely stunning!! Has just enough stretch and the fabric is thick enough to hide bumps ğŸ˜‰.  Only con, I am very small chested - 36 A- and it is a little big up top. It looks great, but should be taken in a little to be perfect. I highly recommend this dress.


5'8, pear shaped, 165 lbs, normally a size 10. Hope that helps.


GREAT! I am  5'9 and 153 and a athletic build.  I ordered a M and a L. I kept the M. Slanted panel in front moves a little. Love it overall. I will order other colors.


I'm only five feet tall so I need to get this hemmed, but the fit in the bust and hips is amazing.  The fabric is thick and the quality is superb.


Classy and comfortable! Jacket, belt, scarf or sleeveless! Beautiful Navy Blue.


Beautiful dress. Very form fitting.


It fits great. Good for date and work.


I attempted to steam this out and it did not work out like I was hoping and I have to send it out to the cleaners


Dress looked great but the material seems cheap. It's stiff and and makes crinkling noises.


Love love love this dress! I wore it to an office holiday party and it was perfect. The little tucks and design features are all in the right places to disguise problem areas, and it was comfortable to wear too.


This is very cute, it fits very clingy.
