Had to return to get a smaller size, which I won't complain about.  Great quality!


Just get the dress! Get the dress! I bought it in every color and is hitting on all cylinders! I am 5 6 and weigh 198 so I bought a 2X. My, my, my, my. I wish I knew how to upload a photo and I would show you I'm still working on it so, get the dress! It's  not white but off white.  Beware! Looks great on!!


Love this dress. Bought one on green too!!


For buying a dress online it fit well but it's really long. I'm going to have it hemmed up slightly. Otherwise fits pretty true to size, if you're curvy you may want to go up a size.


This dress is very flattering.  The color green is beautiful.  The pleats in the waist make your shape fabulous.  The fabric is somewhat stretchy too.  You should buy this dress!!


Perfect fit! I love the material, the style, and length of this dress.


Returned it. Nice dress, but just too small for me. I ordered a M.


Absolutely love this dress, purchased it in multiple colors. The fit is perfect!!!!


I really like the dress and I'm losing a few pounds to fit it
