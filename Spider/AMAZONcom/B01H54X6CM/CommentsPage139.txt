The material is very thin and delicate. I have a tummy and it does not hide it whatsoever.


Love it!


The dress is classy and sexy. My only complaint is it's a little too tight. I will still wear it, as planned.

It's nice. Can't wait to wear it. I'm normally a Med I ordered a Large and it fits well.


Really liked this; read the size chart and be sure you measure accurately.  If you do you will be pleased.

This dress is beautiful! It hugs all the right places but is modest enough for a business dinner or event. Love it!
