This dress fit like a glove. I got so much compliment. True to size. I absolutely love it


Wore this today for church and loved it. The color was as shown in the picture. The material was very soft and able to stretch to fit your body. I am 5 months pregnant so I ordered a medium and I was a perfect fit.


This dress..listen..it's amazing!!!!!' It pulls is ALL the right places!'


The color says burgundy but it really is more of a red color.  It's so pretty and fits so well!  Thank you!!!


Absolutely loved this dress. Need a slip or a dark pair of stockings because of the colour of the fabric. It is one of my favourites!!


I wore this to a corporate party and got so many compliments. Fits fantastic and looks so much more expensive than it is. Will be buying again in another color!


A friend recommended this dress. When I tried it on, I fell in love with it. The fit is incredible. And, it is so well made, that I ordered three more. A black one, a red one, and a white one.


Love this dress! Fits well. Sexy but relatively modest. Nice color. Only complaint is that the fabric backing (?) around the neckline is not affixed (?) to the front of the dress so it rides up. Will probably find some iron-on solution or take to the dry cleaner to fix. Still a great dress for the price.


Love it. I want more colors. Fit perfect I ordered a MEDIUM and 135lbs and 5'3.
