I ordered the burgundy and the green dress in tho style, I absolutely love them both.  Now I want every color.  This dress hugs every curve so if you're self conscious about your lady lumps then buy it lol.  You know what they say, if you've got it; flaunt it.


love this dress


This dress is good quality.  I am 5' 3.5" tall and 149lbs.  Based on the reviews I bought a large, however the medium would have been a better fit.  The dress is a bit long for me.  An overall good dress.


Cute and well made dress.  This particular dress is too large for my daughter but is most likely sized accurately.


Beautiful dress. Definitely size up. Nice material and will agree with others that you must wear figure smoothing under garments. Would definitely purchase again from this seller.


Feel so sexy in this.  It's more off white than white but who cares.  My husband's eyes where bigger than quarters.


ok


Really classy and well fitting dress.


looks vibrant and the quality is there.


Great dress if you have an hour-glass type figure, will be very flattering. The detailing really helps disguise any stomach trouble.
