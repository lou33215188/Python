Love the dress, comfortable, and beautiful


Like the material a lot! Very comfortable fit and soft material. Very bright and colourful.


Love it


Love the dress fit perfectly which surprised me had gotten a few tips on the past and all ran small.


I was skeptical when I ordered but omg it was totally worth it! I went one size up than my normal size and it fits perfectly! It's so flowy and long and the fabric feels heavy in a good way! It does not cling to your body! Would buy again!


Fits great on the chest. With around the waist it was a little tighter. But lots of compliments


I like the dress, but it is about two sizes below the stated measurements.


I incorrectly said it wasn't delivered. We found it!


This dress is just gorgeous, it Flows so beautiful as you walk, perfect for spring or summer, and great price, really love it.


Too small! Need a little bigger.
