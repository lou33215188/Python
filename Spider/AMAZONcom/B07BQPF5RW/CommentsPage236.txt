Nice dress!  I can't wait to wear it next summer.


This fit perfectly. It's a great dress for my upcoming cruise. It flows behind me like I'm a runway model. I can tie up the sides to look beach, too.


This dress is much larger than the indicated measurements and is poor quality. I purchased an XS which they state is a 29.5" chest, 20.5" waist. My chest is around 33 (32 C) and my waist is 23/24 inches so I figured if anything an XS would be too small, but I usually wear a 0/XS so I figured it was a safe gamble since it was on prime and other reviews indicated that it was a good bet it would fit.


This dress is labeled an XS, but is not anywhere near the labeled measurements. The waist doesn't even touch my body. It's way too big, but at the same time, the elastic around some of the buttons is not as tight as many of the others, so there is some gaping in the dress. Fortunately, because it's so large, it hangs in a way that closes most of the gaps. It's for a Halloween costume and it's already Oct 17th, so I may keep it, but would not recommend this dress as a purchase for every day wear.


way small. like Asian sizing or something.  Can't wear for the foreseeable future.  Disappointing.  Otherwise, it seems great.


The dress has a beautiful flow! I'm 5'11 and it still was pretty long on me! Its so versatile and can be worn as a dress or kimono, casual or dressy!


Completely different product


Love it, have 3 different ones, and I get compliments all the time when I wear them. They are super comfortable.


Love love love this dress! It's a great fit, and is comfortable on. I wore it during a girls trip to NYC and got so many compliments!


Very flowy just like the picture


This dress is too long and I need to find out how I can I return
