great, fast shopper


Way too small for me but my very slender daughter is able to wear it and loves it even though it is a size XL!!!  She normally wears a S or XS.


Didn't really care for the dress on me :/ but fit as expected.


Bottom hem not even.


Great dress, fit perfectly and I highly recommend it.


Super comfy dress, I always get tons of compliments wearing it!!


Kinda cheaply made -- didn't fit my body well.


It's darling!! So light and comfortable, perfect for summer nights. Will be ordering other colors for sure!


Great dress. 110 lbs and 5'2 so it's a bit long on me but nothing a pair of heels can't fix.


Love this dress; fit was perfect.
