Fits great at first then when you wash and dry it shrinks to a mini me size. It shrunk probably 3+ inches at the bottom hem. ğŸ˜µ


True to size! Love this dress, light and flows nice. I'm short 5'3 and it's a little long but what isn't on me, but still very nice!


Love it!! Iâ€™m 5â€™7 145lbs and ordered a small (waist 28in). This dress for like a dream!!! I received so many compliments. Light and super comfortable. Will be purchasing more from this company â�¤ï¸�


Lovely dress, mahalo aloha!


great fit .. very pretty


I get a lot of compliments on this dress. It's a bit see-through so I would recommend wearing a slip.


Very cute for a summer dress


Would not button across my chest without pulling.


swimming in this dress, felt like a moomoo


One of the button was off but I cover it up with a belt so it works. I love how flattering the fit is and how light it feels. I think I got you guys atleast 20 new customers as I updated with FB pic which received more than 200 likes. I had too many ppl asking me about where the dress was from.
