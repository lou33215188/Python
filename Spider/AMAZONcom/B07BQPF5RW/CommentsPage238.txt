This dress is pretty but see through. You would have to wear something underneath. I don't know why the other reviews don't tell you this.


You can see through it


Soft flattering dress, perfect for summer nights


So pretty! I look like I'm from Georgia and should be sipping iced tea on my front porch.


Too many buttons and small for the size


It's a nice material, but the bottom portion has a lot more material than pictured, meaning it makes me look like I have wider hips than I really do.  The sides of the bottom are not even, meaning they are longer than front and back.  I tried it with the tallest heels I have and still it is way too long.  It would cost me another $20-25 to get it restyled again.  The top fit perfectly and I have a 35B size, so it's not going to work for someone with larger bust size.  I was sad to return it, but unfortunately I"m not willing to spend more money on tailoring.


It's kind of long


This dress was a disappointment. Beware for it runs small for anyone that's larger than a 36 C (bra size).


Very pretty but fabric is thin and size is a little small.


Wish I would have returned in time- small return window
