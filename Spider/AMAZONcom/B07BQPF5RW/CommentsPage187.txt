Gorgeous dress. Nice and summery with a beautiful flow.


This dress exceeded my expectations!!! The material is very soft and the dress is very flattering!  I bought 2 colors!


Love it!


The dress didn't have an even bottom. The left side was longer than the right. The material and print were her nice though.


Love!!!


TERRIBLE QUALITY


The cut is very full.  The waist didn't sit in the right place and overall too much material used for the skirt.


pretty but way to small


The top part of the dress is too short for the size


Dress was pretty but extremely long.
