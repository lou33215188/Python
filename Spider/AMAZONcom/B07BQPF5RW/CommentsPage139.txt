wife loved it She wears it  all the time


I am totally in love with this! Already looking to order more colors!


Cute dress but poor quality control. Huge tear in the dress was hoping to wear it for an event.


Love this dress. Got a lot of compliments.


Thought this dress would be made with better material and this shade of green is more faded than the product picture.


I love this dress. It does fit as expected but itâ€™s tight on my boobs... which are big anyways. So if you have big boobs you may want to go a size up.


Very nice but too large, exchanged this one for a size smaller


I ordered up a size and it fit perfectly. (Normally wear a medium but ordered the large)


The dress is adorable and very flattering on.


The quality was good with all buttons and seams intact and no stray threads as other reviews had mentioned.


Very pleased and will be ordering another dress in a different color.


Too small


The dress looked just like the picture and fit perfectly. I got a lot of compliments on it. I was very pleased with this purchase.
