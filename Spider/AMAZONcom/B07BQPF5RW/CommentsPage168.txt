love this dress.  The material is very thin so not sure how it will hold up .


Beautiful dress, it runs big!


I wanted to love this dress but it just didn't fall right on me. Maybe if I had sizes down but I didn't have time to order a second one


Beautiful dress and different style. Not sure how long it will last though


Love it! I receive numerous compliments when I wear it. The material is comfortable and flows as good as chiffon!


Washed the dress according to the instructions. The red color bled all over the white flowers. Waste of money!


Received the wrong print. Will have to return and reorder


Bustling is too small.  Hips are fine.  If you are busty lady, I wouldnâ€™t recommend it.  The fabric is very thin and not of good quality


way too small.  My size 2 daughter can wear the XL.


The fit is fine, but it's so see through you have to find a slip that works with the cut of the dress. And it came wrinkled.
