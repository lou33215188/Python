Love it! Received it today and it's perfect for summer. My husband and I are moving to Hawaii so I needed some modest sundress and this is perfect! Very lift and flowy but thick enough to not be see through. The only suggestion I have is if you mr arms are your problem area or if you like looser fitting sleeves I would suggest a size up. I wear a M and the sleeves aren't tight but if they were any smaller it would not be comfortable.


First time I write a review on Amazon. I first got the organge one size small. I loved it so much that I got two more of different colors. I got xsmall though, since I think it would be ok. It fits slightly better than the small. I'm 5'4 and 122lbs. The dresses are perfect! The quality of the fabric is good, too! It does not look like I paid only 24/29 bucks! It's lovely! It's has a romantic and elegant feeling/look.


If I could give this less than one star I would. The material is shoddy. It is poorly and unevenly sewn. The one I order in a xl had sleeve holes so small they bisected my upper arm unto 2 distinct sections like sausages.


It came with lots of loose threads, torn button holes and poorly spaced buttons. I was so disappointed. It looked nothing like the picture.


Your can see in the pictures I have included some of the garment flaws. The picture of my hand in the sleeve shows just how small the arm hole is. For reference my hand is roughly 8 inches long from my palm to the tip of my middle finger.


I sent the dress back the same day I recieved it. I purchased the one labeled "orange" and noticed some of the other colors have different designed sleeves so maybe they have a different fit? I was shocked at how many positive reviews this had received.


Hi I'm 24w pregnant weighing  133 lbs at height 5'4". I wanted a cute dress for our beach vacation and this one is a perfect match. I wasn't sure if I should get a medium or a small and the medium was out of stock so I ordered a small risking a little. This one fit me perfectly even with my ginormous breasts ( pregnancy size 36 D and regular 34C) love the fabric colors and everything about it. Will update after the trip. I'm super excited ğŸ˜�


Update: wore it for my photoshoot on the beach. It's super comfortable and flowy. I got so many compliments for it. It's a steal for $30. Definitely considering other designs


The dress fits nicely.  The strings in the inside(not sure of the purpose) were frayed and a bit broken off.


5'5" 123lb purchased size small. Fits perfect on thin, small bust,frame. Length is to the ground. Haven't washed it yet. Irons easily, flows beautifully.


I sew, so imperfections stood out to me perhaps more than the average person. The biggest being that the shirring under bust line did not match up at the buttons. I adjusted the spacing on three buttons to correct it. Not $100 quality, but that's not what I paid.


I received many many compliments when I wore it to a large gathering.


This is seriously the cutest most comfy maxi ever!! I'm 5'6 144-50lbs .. 34ddd. So I normally wear a 4-6... but breast area is always a nightmare! I ordered a M. Lost sleep over it ğŸ˜¬.. all excited for my new dress. Bottom line, it runs pretty true  to size.


I love this dress! I ordered 3 of them and they are gorgeous! I went to the mall(outlets) and a lot of people gave me compliments. Probably more than 10 people I am sure of that even the sales ladies. I told them where I bought it and the name of the store and they said they will definitely check the store in amazon and good thing I remember the store name(Milumia). I am 5'5, 34-26_35 and x-small fits me.  I love wearing maxi-dress and I will definitely recommend this dress if you wanna look classy! xoxo


Sorry but this wrinkles like crazy and if you have a bust it won't fit right.  Shoulder are too tight.  Sorry I bought it.  The fabric is beautiful.  I may have to sew it into only a skirt.  Too bad.


I LOVE it. Light, flowing and comfortable -- perfect for upcoming hot summers. One of the few short sleeve maxi dresses that still has that lightweight summery feel! I get lots of compliments when I wear it. I'm 5,1 and 103 lbs and XS fits great. I can't wait to buy another one!
