I saw a review of this product on YouTube and fell for it instantly. Fits perfect great quality and flows beautifully! I’m even looking into similar styles for more prints it’s that great!


Size good, just be careful when you wash it, I lost the ropes and I needed to sew up


This is a beautiful and stunning dress. It's great for the holiday's, weddings, or just casual events.


Really wrinkled, so if you don't like to iron that would be a problem. Comfortable though and fits well.


Nice dress. Runs large. Returning dress tomorrow. I'm 5'6", 130lbs, 32D, 28" waist. I ordered a medium and it kind of hung on me. Not a flattering size for my frame.


Love this simple, easy breezy dress. Looks and feels great! Perfect for summer/vacation. Snappy appearance day and night. Love it!


Beautiful dress! Light and flowy, perfect for summer time.  I ordered a medium and I usually wear a 6/8 for dresses and still had a little room.  I have not washed it yet so it may change.  It buttons down further than I thought so the slit can be a modest length if you want to wear to church.


Very pretty dress. Great dress for the price. I ordered a L simply because of my chest size. I probably could have sized down. I'm a 34DD and size 6/8 normally.


I waited just over two weeks for this item to be delivered. I've ordered two other dresses and really like the look.  However, after waiting a whole two weeks, the dress arrived with a large hole on the front of the dress.  I would try to send it back, but I cannot wait another week to ship back and then two more weeks to get a non-damaged one.  Too bad the seems look to be low quality and that's probably why it ripped even before it arrived.


this is a beautiful dress but it came in the package inside out and wodded up in a big wrinkled mess, I have never had this type of presentation of a product before, Really disappointed in that
