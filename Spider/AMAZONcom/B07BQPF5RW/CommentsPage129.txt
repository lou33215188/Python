Super cute! Fits great! Great quality.


This dress is perfect. I thought it would have been super tight and small but it was just perfect! I'm 6 ft and built big (lots of muscle and big rear end) and it was long enough and modest! It super thin and comfy! Perfect for a hot day! I recommend this highly!!


I'm 5'7 and120 lbs purchased a small. I do wear a tank underneath and a slip. Dress is cute and very comfortable


Not at all like the picture. Faded and poor made.


Very flowy and feminine.  Looks very lady like on.


Love it!


❤️❤️❤️❤️love, love , love this dress. Might want to get a size bigger for the loose flowy effect.


Love the material and style. Just too small on me


This dress fit as expected. Around 140ish and got a medium. Vert flowy and cute. I don't like the tassels in the front so I took them off.  Also I really like that you can make tbe slit as high or low as you want.


Beautiful dress but did come apart on the first wash.
