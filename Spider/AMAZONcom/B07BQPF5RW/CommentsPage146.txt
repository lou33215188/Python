Fits great!!! I was skeptical about fit I thought it was going to be to long, but it hit right at my ankles. The material is light and the dress is flowy. The color of the dress is exactly as described. Perfect dress definitely ordering more.


Absolutely loved this dress and got so man compliments on it. I am a 16/18 in dresses and got a XXL because I wanted to make sure I had enough arm room and it fit perfectly. I will def be getting some different styles in this dress.


It's completely see through and it runs a little small if you are a bigger busted woman.


Absolutely love this dress! It's perfect for California weather â˜º


Love this!  It is so comfortable.  However, a size 10 on me went to the floor.  (I am 5'3".)  I had it shortened, and it is great now!


This dress definitely deserves 5 stars and two thumbs up. I have gotten nothing but compliments since I walked out my door this morning. Absolute strangers are complimenting me on this dress. It's a perfect fit and I love the flowing factor of the dress. In flats or heels this dress works!!!


Itâ€™s beautiful and quality is also good.


Loved it.


I ended up returning because the top was too small, which surprised me because I am small chested.  The print was lovely though.


I love it ğŸ˜�


I absolutely love this dress. So many compliments!
