Nice dress.  One of the drawstrings is missing which doesn't effect the dress but still is not ok.  Definitely over priced and not as fabulous as other reviews have found it to be in my opinion.


sleeves wouldn't even go past my elbows.  this is not a true fit for the fit it said it was. Dress is very pretty - sure wish it would have fit.


Big. Inexpensive looking. Wrinkles easily. Not a good purchase, which surprised me given the great reviews.


Ordered a 2x but fits like a Large.  Way too small.


I just love this dress. I got this one so that I can wear at my friends's graduation. this is a perfect summer dress. The neck is little low but I wear a cami inside. It looks very classy


This is an awsome dress. I got so many compliments. A lady stopped me in the store and told me how pretty the dress was on me. I love this dress.


I love the pattern on this dress, and it seems quite well made for the price.  My only (tiny) complaint is that I think the arm holes are attached slightly too low.  When I raise my arms, I feel like the entire dress lifts up.


I am large chested but small bodied, so I have a hard time finding flattering clothing. This is flattering. Nice soft flow and feels great.


I love this dress it fit perfectly


Fits exactly as described. Colors beautiful and dress can be worn as casual day dress or dressed up with heels etc and be worn to daytime event. Very comfortable to wear and works well for young adult or woman over 50. I'm over 50 and some dresses just look too young once on but this one looks appropriate for myself and my daughters that are in their early 20's like it also. The length hit me just above ankle and I'm 5'7"
