I love the pattern and the way it fits on me; I receive many compliments every time I wear the dress.  I have long legs and the dress is pretty long on me, I have to be careful walking up stairs.


Would purchase this style of dress again and recommend this dress to friends!


Fits beautifully. Color radiant. I received lots of compliments! I can't ask for more!


Don't love it....


It's way too long.  (And I'm 5'-7")


 Think it would be nicer if it were a tea length perhaps...


Beautiful dress! So light and comfortable. I am 5' 6" and am in between a size 10-12. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly!


Good fit except chest is revealing


The color, print and style looks the same as the onloine display,I also like the color very much.This is my first time making an online clothing purchase  so the comparison is very different to me,but I am impressed, will diffinitely make recommendations,the delivery was pretty impressive also.


At first, the fit is great. But they shrink like crazy! Had to give them all to my 13 yo dd. I bought 5.


If you have any boobage, get ready for the buttons to pull and have that wavy texture from the pulling. Beautiful dress despite that flaw. As far as length, I'm 5'3" and it just grazed the floor while barefoot.


Beautiful! 5'4 and 120lbs


Small fit perfect, length is excellent


Princess dress


Hubby loved it- elegant and modest


Buttons button below my knee and fits my chest- bra size is 36C


I love this dress. Got tons of compliments on it too. Needs a slip, because it is a little see through. And the string the goes around the waist was odd and I didn't like it, so I just cut that off. But this is a beautiful and flattering dress!
