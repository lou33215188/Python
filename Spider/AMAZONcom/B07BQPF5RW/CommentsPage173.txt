Feels so comfortable makes me feel pretty


absolutely adorable, comfy and perfect for warm weather


Issue with fit across the bust area, I purchased XL and I am a 38D. The button closures have a stretchy band material which is forgiving but in the bust area it does not lay flat even though it feels like there is enough room.


Pretty dress.  Nice flattering design.


I have only wore this dress once so far and had a ton of compliments! Its beautiful and very comfortable.

In love... i have 3 dress from these seller  all very sexy and elegant... where i go everyone say it is gorgeous...


I thought this would be good for my grandson's wedding but it didn't fit my body which is old!  LOL  Thank you for the chance to try it on and while it didn't work for me, I trust it will work for someone thinner.  JO


Nice fabric at a cheap price.  Would recommend ordering up one size as it runs small.


Runs small. Tie was frayed and torn on one side. I cut it off.
