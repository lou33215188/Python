I love this dress! It fits perfectly and is very comfortable. I have a large chest area and the buttons don’t pull. I’m very happy with it!


Good quality but I am exchanging for a smaller size.  I'm 5'3" 125 lbs and I ordered a medium based on other reviews.  It looks way too big.

Love this dress.  I'm 5'6" and 150 lbs with 38C size bust and the Large fits great.  The bottom of the dress comes about to my ankles, just as pictured on the model.  Highly recommend this lovely dress.


Very chic, good quality, buttons dictate how long or short the slit is.
