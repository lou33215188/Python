This dress runs small, and a bit short. I like my dresses to go to the floor.


I received several compliments on this dress.


MY WIFE LOVED THE DRESS


I think the dress is exactly how it's presented on the add.


This dress looks so beautiful on the picture. However, in real life, it has this kind of old fashioned style.


Absolutely ugly


I love the dress even if it is a little smaller than expected.


This dress runs about 5 sizes smaller beware!!


Super cute and comfy dress. My only complaint is that the chest fits a little too small for me, so I have to wear something else with it underneath so I can wear the top portion unbuttoned. Otherwise amazing and looks beautiful on!


It fix pretty good


I wear it, but mostly just around home.  The hemline is really odd.  If it was equally uneven it would be better than just being uneven on one side.  Ya get what you pay for, I guess.
