it is a very pretty dress but it is not a 2x..it is more like a 2...going to give it to my daughter


Gorgeous, inexpensive, held up to washing and does not really wrinkle- wearing it right now! LOVE! I get tons of compliments too!


I really love this dress. I got a size large because I am a size 10, but it ended up having quite a bit of room in the chest and shoulders, which I don't mind at all! If I were to order it over again, I would order a medium, but I still love it. Very flirty and feminine! 10/10 would recommend.


I ordered light green 2, and the color is dingy. I chose my size based on the sizing chart, and it fits okay, but it's a little iffy near the bust. It might be more flattering if the elastic was more around the waist than right under my boobs.


Absolutely beautiful dress. Fits perfect. Had to buy another one for my mom.


Lovely pattern. Fabric is nice and flowy. But once again even a 2x is too small. It is my typical size from US retailers. I think these are products made overseas. They are very affordable, but I think the sizing is a bit off.


I sent this back because it's obviously made in Asia by smaller women.  I'm not large for an American, but this dress is really short-waisted and extremely long.  Also, it was too see-through for my taste.


I am small built and 5'2. I bought a XS and the dress fits perfectly, at the perfect length. Ankle level and right above the ground. Did not step on it once all day while walking.


One of my favorite purchases! Light, flowy material but great quality. Vibrant color, lots of buttons but easy on/off. Ankle length - pairs well with flats or summer chunkies. Fast delivery w/Prime. Size Large fits 5'8 - 170, 34DD


The dress was actually better than I expected. It is a great summer weight material and well constructed. I am 5 feet 5 inches and it was a little long, but that is easily fixed with a needle and thread. I would buy from this dealer again.
