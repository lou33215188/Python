I tried this dress on, it was too tight in the bust and my husband thought I had gotten a new night gown. Picture very misleading.


the arms are for a regular person on a plus size dress it doesn't work for me


Super comfortable..got lots compliments. I'm 5'7.5 180 lbs 36DD..XL  fit great. Flattering. Just wish it was cap sleeve or sleeveless:)


Love the fit!


Very nice. I expect to get a lot of use out of this dress.  Alot of buttons though and it will have to be hemmed as it is very long.


I really wish my dress did not show up damaged! It is lovelt except the tassel is not attached on one side and holding on by a thread on the other. Sad because I really do like this dress


Gorgeous print and very flirty style. Sizing runs on the smaller side. Would encourage anyone interest to go 1-2 sizes up.


I love this dress and can't stop wearing it, i had to buy 3 more of other colors. It's very comfortable but looks great at the same time and the material feels soft and nice.


It's very pretty, the picture doesn't do it justice however....the sizes are waaayyy off. I bought a 2x and it is a size 10


Being a busty girl, I made sure and measured before ordering and went by the listed size chart. While it techincally fit (the buttons buttoned) it was very snug in the bust. Wish I had gone up a size but was on a time crunch. The dress was overall very beautiful and I received lots of complements. The fabric was nice and cool and flowy and was not see-thru.
