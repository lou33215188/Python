I like the fabric, like the dress,  but the top does not fit to well.


Such a cute dress! I got the pink floral one and it's great. I'm 5'8" and XL wasn't quite to the floor but still looked cute.


Love this dress! Compliments every time I wear it and the fit is perfect.


One of the button loops were broken which I didn’t notice until I had the dress on and I was buttoning it, but it’s nothing I can’t fix by sewing it. It’s very pretty and comfortable. I received many compliments


I'm 5'4 closer to 5'5 Weight 130lbs and the small size fit perfect I have a short torso so I was concern that it might fit me to tight but it didn't it fit perfect the material makes the dress fit into your body type most of my body is composed of legs the length was perfect as well..


I absolutely LOVE this dress! I have received multiple complements every single time i wear it. It did shrink when i washed it but thats okay, as it was a tiny bit too big when i bought it.


Super easy to breastfeed in and nice and flowy to cover my mum tum!!! I plan on buying more in different prints!


Great dress! Received so many compliments.


This dress is even better than pictured. It fits nice and sung up top and is cute and flowy at the bottom, not to mention it’s super comfy!! The material is also soft and airy, perfect to keep cool and stylish in the summer


Love the dresses fit, just did not like having to iron it. It flows beautifully


Fits very small on top and very big on the bottom
