It's as if the dress were made in separate places and someone put the panels for a smaller dress on top of the skirt for a larger one. The bottom hall of the dress fit beautifully, it flowed was snug at the waist yet didn't attach at the hip. The to half, waist up? Was for a child, a breastless, meatless, bony, no muscle little child.  Had to send it back, it sucked!!!ğŸ˜”ğŸ˜•


Chest was a bit small,especially because the buttons have elastic loops that stretch over the chest somewhat. I'm also 5'2" and it was too long.


Nice fabric and fit. Got lots of compliments on it whenever worn. Bought a second one in different fabric that is equally beautiful!


Love love love this dress!!! Fit and flow is amazing!


Had many people complimenting it when I wore it.


The color is so different than the image displayed.

Great dress, the arms where just a bit tight. Wish I would have ordered an XL!
