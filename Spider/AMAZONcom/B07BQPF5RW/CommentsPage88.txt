I reallt wanted to love this dress. However... tje sleeves were not sown evenly,  so that one sleeve was poofy (think cinderella) and the other was not.


And, upon my first wearing... the skirt split from the boddice in many places. I will fix the seams, but honestly, it just isnt a well made dress.


Very pretty Dress. I bought the medium after reading reviews and found it to be too large. Will exchange it for a small. I am 5'5" 130lbs and a 32DDD. The dress skims the floor for me with flats on.


loved the red color, but i am petite and it seems like i drown in this dress, plus it has there cumbersome buttons all over which gape.


Cute, but see-through and cut small


My favorite dress. I ordered it in 3 different patterns. This color is beautiful.


I sent this back because there was just soooo much fabric. I was swimming in it. I thought sizing down one would help, but still a ton of fabric. It would look amazing for beach photos, but a little awkward for everyday wear.


If you have large breasts, order up or expect to wear an undershirt. It's good to wear as a cover up for a bathing suit. I loved how flowy it is and made me feel pretty.


Good quality but the waist is cut way too high, if you have any sort of chest, the waist is going to be on your boobs after you wash it (as it shrinks about 10%)


I was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful dress! Soft, flowy, perfect for summer. Slightly tight in the chest area causing the buttons to pull but nothing some double sided tape can't fix. What a steal!


I actually love the way the dress fits. It's very flattering, and flows beautifully. However, it came covered in little holes, almost as if moths had gotten to it. Super disappointed, as it really did look great on, until I looked down and saw the light shining through all the holes, haha. For reference, I am 5'6", 170 lbs, 34 DDD, and the large fit me perfectly.
