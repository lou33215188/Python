Bought this dress for an upcoming event, fits perfect!


I'm 5'5"/130 and ordered a medium. Should have purchased a small. The top has more coverage than the photo shows.


Lovely dress.


Love this dress.  I'm 5'6", and 145 lbs and ordered a L.  It has a beautiful shape and fits well. Good value for the price.


Nice garment in spite of wrinkles. A lot longer than expected. I will have to pay to have hemmed


Too small in chest area


This dress is absolutely beautiful. It fits perfectly. I received many complements when I wore this.


Love it


Awesome


Love this dress. Beautiful on & received lots of compliments. I got a large which was perfect for my body- bouncing back from having a baby.


I love how this dress flows and I always get compliments when I wear it.
