I'm 5'5 and 110 lbs (more or less), and the dress is cute but too big on me for going out. Nonetheless it's a perfect lounge dress for weekends! :)


This dress is gorgeous - can't wait to wear this summer. The chest fit very tight and gapes - but that's to be expected with size 38G lol. Another thing to consider - the dress can be slipped on over the head, but it is also a functional button-loop design. Just wayyy too many buttons to deal.


I am 5'1. It hits the floor with me wearing 2 in. Wedge shoes. So that being said.  I love the dress.  So much so I'm ordering a second one in another color


It runs small ! Iâ€™m a M-L I got XL  I absolutely love it! Itâ€™s great material, flows beautifully! ğŸ‘—


Absolutely love this dress. I use it for my photography clients and wear it myself. Lovely soft, flowy fabric. I get compliments every time I wear it out.


it is really cute and slimming. I am going to buy some other colors for summer.


This dress is stunning. I've five three and 140 pounds and got a small. It's perfect and flowy and lightweight so you don't sweat from all the fabric. Would definitely recommend!!!


Wash before altering and order up one size!! Obvious, I know. I shortened this (I'm 5'2" and I had to take off maybe 3 inches to wear safely with flats) then inevitably I got food on it. After the wash, it shrunk up about 3 inches. Thinking, maybe I can save this and make it a short dress, no go. The buttons up top were gaping because it shrunk overall :'( so sad. At least I got a couple wears out of it.


Larger than the other dress that was the same style and size but just in a different pattern so I had to return it.  This dress is also poofier than the other one also.


Really pretty and flowy. I was on the fence about buying this dress but figured I could always return it if I didn't like it. I will be keeping it. I wish the tassel string around the waist wasn't just decorative but actually cinched the waist in. Other than that, it's great.
