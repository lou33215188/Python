lovely


Love this dress!


This dress is too small especially in the bust.  I need to send it back and get a larger size.  How do I send it back?  Did not come in it's own pkg., came with shoes.  What do I do?


The dress runs on the big side.


I havenâ€™t worn it yet, but it looks promising! Very nice fabric, and it appears to be well made. Very beautiful.


It's very long for me, I'm 5 '1"


It's beautiful!!! I received so many compliments.


has many loose threads, the tape on the waist is badly cooked


Fits perfect and looks great...gives a nice figure for a women with curves! I bought another one in a different color!


Great dress!  Fits perfectly and it's great material. Highly recommend it.
