Very narrow shoulders.


Beautiful material and pattern but bust area way too small


I cannot even count the times I’ve been disappointed by clothing purchases on Amazon so when this arrived I was ecstatic! I wore it on a trip to Egypt and it looked great in pictures! It was modest enough for Egypt yet cute enough for pictures. Very flowy and perfect length. Most long dresses drag on the ground and get dirty but this was absolutely PERFECT! I’m 5”1” with 32DDD bust and the small was perfect. I’m going to order other colors! I know it’s hard to get the full picture of the dress in the photos but I just want to show how beautifully the red pops. Buy it!


Its was larger than normal.


Love this dress!


Fits nicely and is comfortable, but looks a little cheap.


So nice


Beautiful dress!


Comfortable and loads of compliments


I like how it fit up top and covered what needed to be covered!
