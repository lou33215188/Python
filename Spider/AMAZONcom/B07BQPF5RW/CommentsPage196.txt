wore it for my engagement party and everyone loved it!!!


Beautiful. Fits as expected.


Second dress I bought in this style. My favorite new dresses. Strangers literally stop me on the street to compliment it.


I was pleasantly surprised with how happy I am with this dress. It has a nice weight and moves nicely.


Dress was very sloppy and frumpy looking. I ordered my size large to XL it was about 2 sizes to big.


comfortable and casual


So happy. The dress for perfect.  I ordered it in my size and it is great fit.


Love it!! Can't wait to wear it!


Very nice, looking forward to wearing it out,


Great looking ,But it just hangs on you .Way to long
