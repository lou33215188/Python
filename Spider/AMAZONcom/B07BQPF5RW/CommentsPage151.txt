good party or fancy beach dress. Great to take on next vacation. Thank you!


It's a good dress but one tie string was missing in front. Price is worth it


I bought this for a photo shoot that’s Easter themed. I’m 5’4” and weigh 125 lbs and the dress fit perfect. Didn’t touch the ground, perfect length. Would buy again.


This dress was darling but too small in the bust area. I returned the dress.


It is a beautiful garden dress.


Too long for me but really cute pattern


This fabric is very flowing and though I ordered the largest size, it almost didn't fit.


Love the feel and the print. I hand washed it but then had to press it with iron


lots of buttons, its cute but a bit tight thru my bust [ with all those buttons ]


Huge for a small.  Cr
