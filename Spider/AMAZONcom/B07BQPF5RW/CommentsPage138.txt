I may be returning this as while it's well-made and fits well and I like it, all the buttons came off just trying to button it up. 22 buttons! I don't know that I want to sew on 22 buttons


I like this dress a lot!


Beautiful print and dress!  The sleeves and shoulders were way too tight, but rest of dress fit perfectly


This is a beautiful dress!  It's super flowy and feminine.  The only downside is the buttons - there are so many buttons!


Bought a large and it fits great. I'm 5'7", 145 lbs, and a 38D or 36DD. Length is fine with flats.


I LOVE this dress!! It’s so flowy and fit perfectly!! I usually wear a medium, I ordered a medium, and it couldn’t fit better!! Love the color, love the shape, very flattering! This picture doesn’t do justice. I’m 5’5” and the length was perfect on me.


I got so many compliments on this dress. It fit perfect. The only down side for me is that it is a little long and the bottom is starting to fray.


Adorable dress. Lots of bang for 29 bucks. Great!!!


Beautiful fabric, light weight. I went a size larger and was glad I did.


loved this dress. fits well and comfortable
