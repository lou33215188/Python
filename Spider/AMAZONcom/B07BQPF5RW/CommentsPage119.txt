I bought this as a secondary dress to wear at my wedding in July. It showed up a day early which was nice. The sizing and reviews are correct with it being smaller in the chest area. I ordered an XL to be safe and it's loose everywhere but my chest. I also have a 40 inch bust.


Can't believe how well it fits and I have ordered 3 more...different colors and print. Makes me look slimmer and quality is not cheap either. It's been great for my trip to Asia...Sexy and conservative at the same time.


I have this dress in white and now black. I get a lot of compliments.


This looks nothing like the picture. I look like a peasant wearing it. Actually, I have never worn it. I wish I can return this waste of money.


Crap - did not like the fabric, fit, there are too many gaps between the buttons that run straight down the front.


I love this dress and get so many compliments on it! It wrinkles easily, but the price, fit, style, and colors are perfect!


Fit perfectly.  Looks great on too.  Very happy with purchase.  The flow is lovely.


did not look good. Hung like a sheet. buttons didn't stay close. cheaply made. Returned it.


I really wanted to love this dress! It looks so flowy and romantic in some of the pics. But for me it just didn't work. I'm pretty petite and it just overwhelmed me. It looked like I was wearing a sheet. Ah well.


Super cute!
