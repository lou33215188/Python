Beautiful dress. I washed it first to get rid of the wrinkles. The fitting is perfect. Although I'm a short girl (4'11"), the dress is definitely too long for me, but I kinda like how it flows all the way down to the floor.  It looks elegant that way. I love it!


Absolutely adore this dress! I bought two, this green one and the navy with 3/4 sleeves. I wore the navy one to go see RENT and it was a show stopper, strangers kept stopping me to compliment my dress. I've already gotten three compliments on this green one and I haven't even left my house yet. ;-)


For reference, I am; 5'1", a triple D, hourglass  figure who wears a size 12 pant, medium tops and usually a medium or size 12 dress(USA). For these dresses I opted to buy the XXL per the description and they fit flawlessly.


Warning to my fellow well endowed ladies, these are functional buttons!! You will have button gaps!! Luckily, I anticipated this and planned ahead, I sewed up the top (from the empire waist up) button holes and violá it still fits perfectly and I am not flashing tiny windows of boob to the world.


Like many of the reviewers have claimed you will feel like a fairytale princess in these. They are so dianty, flowly and perfectly feminine without trying too hard. I love to wear dresses and to feel "pretty" but I hate that that usually means overtly feminine on a very young and pink way or overtly sex-kitten way. So finding a dress like these that I can wear just about anywhere has made super happy. I wear it to work with the children I nanny, out for brunch, just because....


I will say though that the 3/4 sleeve style show cases much more clevage then the short sleeved companions. I have already ordered two more!


As for the length, bottom hem, it's in a bell shape and not exactly even bit you have to really look for the discrepancy. It's very slightly shorted at the front wear your feet are be design, which makes walking without tripping possible. The sides and back graze or dust the floor depending on the style and your height. The arm holes and sleeves are perfect too. Highly highly recommend this dress to everyone.


You can see that my dress is slightly wrinkled, that would be my only point of very slight annoyance. The shipping method basically balls it up so when you open it, it is wrinkled to the point of absolutely needing a steam or ironing. I steamed the 3/4 sleeve one. I let the green short sleeve one hang for a few weeks and most but not all of the wribkles eventually fell out. I don't feel like steaming it today ;-)


This dress is beautiful. I'm a size medium and my measurements are 38 D cup, 27 inch waistline, and 44 inch hips. I got this dress in large because I wanted a flare, loose, fit. I'm 5,6 and a half and I weigh 165 pound.


This dress comes a little bit above my ankles, which is okay because I can wear a nice heel and shoe off the shoe. Overall I love this dress, the material is soft and the fit is very comfortable. I would and did purchase again


I'm 5'2 and my  measurements are bust 38" and my waist is 31" and my hips are 41". I bought a small but I should've bought a medium. I love this dress and will buy the medium in more colors.


I'm always skeptical buying clothes online, but I was pleasantly surprised when I put this on.


I bought the light blue, XXL. I normally wear a 16 and have some luck in the chest department.  I can never find cute summer dresses that don't make my boobs look overly friendly and keep me comfortable in TX heat. This dress met all my requirements.


1. Modest, but still let's the girls get some sun


2. Long, but not dragging on the ground


3. Arm/boob range of motion.


I'm 5'4 so I can't wear long dresses without hemming them, but this dress falls just right. It's light and flowy so it perfect for the beach or hot days when you have absolutely have to leave your air conditioned apartment. This dress is a tad see through because the fabric is so thin, but a nude slip pairs perfect! Don't wear dark underwear and you'll be fine.


This dress buttons up the front with little elastic hoops. One of those was broken when I got mine, but I mended it back in place no problem.


There is extra fabric behind the buttons too so you don't have to worry about your boobs looking like they are busting the buttons like most button up tops. Fellow DD babes know my pain.


I definitely recommend buying this dress! I am going to get a couple different colors too. WORTH IT!


If you don't like to be stopped in the streets by strangers, then don't buy this dress. I wore this to the cherry blossom festival in Washington DC and I counted at least 12 people who asked me the classic "where did you get it??" And I was like "yeah, like I'm gonna tell you... ğŸ˜‚"


There are some issues, it is quite See through and when you stand still/sit anyone will see right through the button area... all the way down... I will be adding a dress slip to mine.


Love this dress. Came wth small hole on the shoulder, but I was in a time crunch so I kept it. It was perfect.


I received so many compliments on this dress and I will probably buy another one! I am 5'2" and 150 pounds and ordered a Medium. It was perfect! So flowy and comfortable too.


Good dress for the price. I had ordered a L though I usually wear a M/S because I wanted a loose fit. The length was almost grazing the floor when worn with no heels for my 5'6 height. The fabric is not see through but the stitching is not great, hence the four stars. The tassel had come undone in the package itself. I removed the sleeves from my dress as they were giving a very matronly feel to the it. With some quick fixing it was a great dress for my beach vacation.
