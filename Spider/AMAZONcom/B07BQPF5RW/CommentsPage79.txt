By the time I sized for a 38" bust the shoulders were hanging 2-3 inches off each side and I was drowning in excess fabric. The pink print is gorgous.


Looks so pretty feels so good ... very elegant look.. seems to be good material very smooth .. fittings are perfect ! Loved it ğŸ˜�


Gorgeous dress, great fit, even works for my height 5'3." Will still need heels, but that's fine, as most maxi dress are too long for me even with heels.


Fabric quality  is good , colors are vibrant and nice floral print; can be clubbed with plain shrug to give a different new look


Love this Dress


Buttons are fragile though


Beautiful in person. I got the white and pink flower print. Size is as expected, however it doesn't touch the floor like I thought it would. I'm 5"7 and ordered a medium.


I am a size large. I ordered a size large and an extra large. The large fit well but it was a bit tight around the chest causing the buttons to gap. So I ended up keeping the extra large.


Have gotten a few of this style it is so gooey and flattering, make sure to hand wash only to avoid any shrinkage. Otherwise they are very nice.


The breast bottons have extra fabric behind them so if they stretch, you can't see the bra. I love that!!!


Really cute, comphy, compliments and size worked great. Bust measurements true to size chart and the dress left lots of forgiveness room in the middle and arms. I would order size based on bust measurements since mid area left extra room give wise. Totally could work as a maternity dress but doesn't make you look pregnant if not.
