Inferior product.  Do not waste your money.  The elastic part of the dress did not match up and the button were all out of whack!  I will never buy from this vendor again.


This dress is fantastic. I have never gotten so many compliments on one item of clothing! Flattering and super lightweight for summer.


Bought the smallest size and it SWALLOWED ME, so un-flattering.  Such a shame, it looks great on the model. I would NOT BUY THIS. I'm 5'3, 115 pounds. Muscular legs.


Dress was beautiful, and I'm sure it would have steamed out perfectly. It fit me in the shoulders, but the bust was too small and the waist was way too high. I was really looking forward to wearing this at a wedding in two weeks.


5ft 8in. 135 lbs, 36 C. Too big everywhere. Too much gather in waist, too much bulking fabric over gather and skims the floor in length. If you are as tall and have more chest or all around weight it may not hang as low or loose.


It is a beautiful dress and I loved it, unfortunately I have 40DDs and even though I ordered the XXL it still stretched too much.  I am going to have to return it and try another size but it's a nice dress!  Everywhere else fit great, I'm 5'7".


I love this dress.  The length is a bit too long.  The skirt tends to hang uneven, longer in the back.  Very attractive and super comfortable.  I am average height and weight.  I bought the medium.  I recommend this dress


Very pretty dress.  Looks just like the picture.  Fits true to size.  My only 2 issues are the gap between the buttons and the loops but not too bad and also the front tie is in a weird place so I just cut it off.  Freat value for the money.


The dress was a bit large, and fit weird. No shape, and the dangles in the front were obnoxious. Very light material and comfortable.


Wore this to a wedding brunch with a large pink hat - and looked very nice.  Was pleasantly surprised.
