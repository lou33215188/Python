Beautiful, flowy, well-made dress! The tiny buttons, elastic waist, and adorable pattern make this dress a great buy. Being 5â€™ I was hesitant to buy a maxi dress without trying it on first. Thankfully, this dress is the perfect length - Iâ€™ll be able to wear it with wedges or flat sandals.


Exactly what I need for a summertime wedding. The material is light. The length is perfect. I'm glad I found it !


A very pretty summery dress.  A bit small in the bust area and I am not chesty so if you're top heavy this wouldn't be for you.  It does wrinkle easily.  Nonetheless I like it very much.


I was so excited to recieve this dress. The colors are beautiful and the material flows just right. However, I will never understand why they would make the button loops strechy. What a dumb idea. There was enough material to cover my chest but due to the strechy loops there was a huge gap in the material, rendering it unwearable. Its a real bummer because this dress is so lovely.


This dress is soooooo pretty and soooooo comfortable. I'm just absolutely delighted with it. It pairs well with my JJ Perfection women's lightweight chiffon rushed sleeve open front blazer!  ğŸ˜�


love the dress but it runs very small ordered true to size and was to small in the bust...so had to order up two sizes very cute and light weight...;) I went by the models measurements and was way to small so do go by that...and I'm not top heavy in any way...I'll wear this new size one alot just size up runs very small...


LOVE THIS DRESS! So nice and flowy!


The size S was a bit big on me, but the length was perfect! I am 5ft2 for reference, and 125lbs.


Beautiful dress.  I wish I had ordered two at the same time.  It took too long to get to me.


I never write reviews but I am so in love with this dress!! I've bought clothing on Amazon before and always wind up disappointed. It's great material and super high quality. Other reviews about sizing are correct--if you're big busted I would go with an XL! I wear a size 38 C and it just barely fits in the bust. One of my favorite pieces in my closet!


i love the dress, the size is basically fine, but the arms are too small for the dress size.  I'll have to do some sewing to be able to wear it.
