Love everything about this dress! Will definitely buy it again in other colors!


The dress was adorable, but the top fit very small.  I wear a 12-14 and 36d bra and the buttons barely closed over my chest, and it was so tight on my upper arms.  I really liked the print and style a lot.  If it was just tight in the chest, I considered wearing a lacy cami with it and leaving it slightly open, but the arms were too tight to be comfortable.  Sadly, I sent it back, but if I ever see it in a larger size or hear that the bodice design has been altered, I would try it again.  5 stars on appearance, 1 star on fit.


Love this dress. I've gotten so many compliments on it I almost want to buy another! Super cute and comfortable.
