This dress is amazing for the price.  I bought it in two different colors/patterns, and they are both beautiful.  I came back to order another color, that's how much I like this dress!  Super comfortable, too.  I will say, though, that I am 5'8" and this dress is definitely maxi-length on me.  I would think that on someone a few inches shorter, it would actually be dragging on the ground if you didn't wear heels.  I plan to wear these dresses mostly with sandals so the length is perfect, but I can't understand some of the comments saying the dress is too short!  Also -- it arrives wadded up in a tiny package, so you do have to iron it or otherwise do something to get the wrinkles out before wearing.


OMG!!!! I LOVE this dress :) It fits PERFECT and is just as pictured. Light weight and the colors are vivid they really pop. The lines, stitching and smocking were all in excellent condition. The dress holds up with washing. You can dress this up or down I did purchase this as more for a casual wear, like with my denim jacket and sandals. I ordered a SMALL and it was PERFECT all around with size and length, I'm 5'3" , 100lbs and a DD cup. I'll definitely be ordering more,


Pretty pattern, thin fabric.  Unfortunately if you have a large chest, this will gape open.  I'm a size 10, 5'7, 36D.  The Large fit fine in the waist, even a little loose.  BUT all the buttons at the top were gaping open.  This is not a dress you can wear with a cami and a few buttons unbuttoned either.  It also looks a little matronly.  I'm in my 30s so that should put it in perspective too for me to say that.  Sending back.


I'm 115lbs and 5'4 and ordered a medium. Fit great!! The material is amazing too. I did however have to wash it as it had a dead fishy odor, but I'm assuming it was just packaged on the truck with something fishy. Idk but iwashed it and it was all better. Material didn't shrink. Love this dress so much I'm thinking of getting my mother in law one !


The dress arrived early, a little wrinkled but it ironed wonderfully. I'm 5'8", 38D chest. I ordered an XL and it fits comfortably around the chest and hits at my ankles. One thing you can't see in the pictures is that the dress (at least the color I bought, navy-green) has a ruched band around the waist, which gives it plenty of room to stretch, I don't think I would have any trouble ordering a size smaller if I wanted. The opening hits me mid thigh but I don't feel exposed or indecent. The neckline is a bit low but the dress will look great with a tank top. Great purchase, will buy again!


Iâ€™m so glad I listened to the positive reviews! This dress was all I had hoped for! It was the perfect Easter dress! I included a photo. I am 5â€™7â€� and typically wear a size 8-10. The medium was PERFECT! I will be buying more in the different colors and styles.


There's good news and bad news where this dress is concerned. The good news is that the style is very flattering on someone like me who is a little pear shaped. The fabric is light and comfy and feels feminine without being fussy. The bad news is that the sizing is hit and miss. I took a wild guess and ordered a size large (I'm 5' 2", 160#). It was just a tiny bit snug across the bust but I loved it so I ordered two more in extra large. When those arrived, one fit perfectly and the other is so  tight in the bust and sleeves that I don't know if I can wear it. It's noticeably smaller than the size  large that I first ordered. Maybe it'll be the incentive I need to drop a few pounds. One more thing... if you need to shorten this dress, as I did, WASH IT FIRST! It WILL shrink considerably.


Love this dress!!! Highly recommend it! I wore it for my birthday dinner and made everyone turn around to look at my dress lol it is very flowy! I am 5"1 and weight 156 lbs and got a large. I did however needed to wear high heels because it's so long but I don't mind it is still worth it! I plan to purchase other colors later in the future.


I have never left an Amazon review before, but this dress is so amazing! I'm 6 ft tall, 210 lbs and usually wear a size 16.  I ordered a large after looking through all the reviews, I usually wear XL, and it fits perfect!! It hits me about mid calf, and the elastic in the waist makes it fit beautifully. I will say, I have a small bust, only a B cup, and I feel like if you are much bigger the top will be too small. There's not much give there. I never buy clothes online because I'm too tall, but i will actually be buying more of these!! So many compliments!  I've worn twice to my office job and the fabric is not too sheer. It's holding up well. Love it!


I love this dress. I bought it as a maternity dress and it fit perfectly. The top and sleeves are perfect (Iâ€™m 38 in bust) and the bottom is just a tad long but Iâ€™m petite at 5â€™2â€� so simple wedges make it just right. Itâ€™s so soft and flowy and definitely looks like I bought it at a boutique store. Really beautiful print. Very pleased with this purchase.
