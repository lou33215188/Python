Pretty dress except when washed the red bled on to the white flowers. Flowers now are pinkish whitish. Needless to say it really bugs me so I only wore the dress once. I've purchased in the past a different darker design and that didn't happen. I like this line but really disappointed with this dress.


looks cheap. The quality of the material and the ties/toggles are not made well. Color is perfect and cut is good.


Beautiful and downplays my imperfections. I wear it with a small cardigan and it looks amazing.


Beautiful dress.  It makes me feel very feminine, because the fabric is light and flowing.


I ordered a size Small. I am 5'5" and about 122 pounds. Hits about the ankle and fits just right.


Not sexy or cute. Looks like an old lady gown. I was so eager to receive this, but I'll be returning it.


I would recommend a belt the waist is funny


It is very big they must run large.Also i followed the washing instructions on it to wash in cold water also put in a cloth that absorbs the dye and it still ran so now i have a red dress that the red dye ran into the gray and white.Not recommending that you purchase this dress


I love this dress!  Fits great and is very comfortable!  I highly recommend.


Just a little smaller than expected . But its beautiful. I ordered one size up and it just fits so size run a little smaller
