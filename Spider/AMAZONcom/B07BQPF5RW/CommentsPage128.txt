LOVE this dress! Ordered a small (5'2" 112 lbs) there was a little breathing room so I'm sure the XS would have been perfect. It flows beautifully


Runs small. I ordered a size up and still too small. Had to return.


The buttons don't hold very securely. Thin must wear something under the dress


I got so many compliments on this dress. It is so beautiful and can be dressed up or down.


I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for my sleeve getting torn midday. It's a beautiful flowy dress, and the medium first perfectly. I am of a curvy figure, 5'1 and 159 lbs. I just wish it didn't rip. I was planning on buying more designs.


This is so pretty and flattering and comfortable, I love it.


Love this dress- just what I imagined will order one for my mom and maybe another color for myself


This was a perfect dress for a Summer wedding! It was very comfortable and loved how flowy the dress was. I usually don't like to buy clothes online but this one did not disappoint. Size was a perfect fit.


Must have a slip under it. Very see through. Works well with a navy or black slip.


LOVE THIS DRESS!!! Fits perfectly!! I'm 5'4'' 130lbs and I ordered this in a size Medium and it fits perfect, and a perfect length too. I did have to buy a slip, as it as slightly see through. Very comfortable and light weight to wear in the hot months.
