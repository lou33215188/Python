This dress was gorgeous! I had to return it unfortunately because it just wasn't flattering on my body, but the dress itself was beautiful! I purchased the mint floral one. I say go for it.


The sizing was wrong in the answers


Not crazy about this dress. It fits but looks cheaply made. I am sending it back. It did arrive quickly.


I get a lot of compliments on this dress.


Very feminine shape of the dress.  Have several of them. Wish to see  this dress in plain colors.


definately have to get next size.  I had to sew in a liner, quite sheer.  but all in all, very comfortable, lots of complements


Love this dress. It is beautiful and super flowy. It is rayon, which gives it great movement and is perfect for this cut of dress. I'm 5'2", 145 lbs, hippy, busty, small waist, and the medium was a great fit- even a TAD bit on the bigger side- but still great. I'd be afraid to go smaller, for sure. I want more of these immediately. They are so flattering. Highly recommend.


Nice dress for a very reasonable price


Very nice dress.  It fit perfectly by size it said.  Came next day.  What more can you ask for?  I LOVE IT.


I ordered the xx-large per the product sizing chart, based on my bust size.  It was too large.  I returned  it & ordered 1 size down & it is perfect.  The colours are beautiful & more vibrant than the picture.  The fabric is soft & well stitched.  A lovely dress.
