I used this dress on my model and it looked beautiful! It is very flowy and flattering. It's long enough that you could use it for maternity pictures as well. Pictured is a size medium.


Absolutely love my dress!


I'm 5'10" and about 155 lbs. It is long enough and it flows and is very flattering.


Beautiful dress, great value.  I wear size 10-12 and switch between a M and L in shirt/dress size depending on the fit.  I ordered both a M and L, and the medium fit great.  It's very stretchy in the waistband and the extra fabric is forgiving in the hip area.  The tassels are only decorative and do not actually cinch the waist, but the stretchy band does.  The fabric is a little thin so I will need to wear a slip or shorts so my underwear doesn't show.  There is a little panel that goes under where the two sides button together, so there is no gap showing my bra or skin down my center line (LOVE).  I'm 5'2 and the dress sits right above my feet on the front and touches the ground in the back.  When I'm wearing shoes, it might drag a tiny bit, but it will be perfect with wedges.  It did arrive very wrinkly, so it needs a dryer fluff or iron before it can be worn.  Great value!


I should have ordered a larger size but it's so pretty I will try and loose the weight.


Really pretty and flattering dress but was kind of long.  I'm 5'4 and had to shorten it by about 2 - 3 inches


Its so beautiful but the sizes are way way way off. Much smaller than expected


Material is soft and very comfortable. I was worried that it would be thin and see thru, but it isn't. Fits nice and the skirt flows really nice. Will recommend.


It's pretty but it's cut small


I cant say enough about this dress its wonderful!


VERY pretty on.
