The dress fit as expected


Wife love it and it looks great on her.


Love the fit and the colors.


Gorgeous!


Returning. Terribly made.


Such a comfy dress


Arms are slightly tight, fabric is very colorful however and comfortable/silky. But when are Chinese manufacturers going to realize that Asian sizing is not the only kind of sizing there is?  That if they're going to sell to Western culture, then maybe they should think about accommodating Western sizing? Not everyone has arms like twigs. I think I will return.

It was so small never received it. Don't waste ur money


Good
