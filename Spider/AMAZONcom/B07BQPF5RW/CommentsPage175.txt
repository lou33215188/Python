Really pretty dress, print is lovely. Very small in the bust if you're fuller chested.


Beautiful dress!


Fresh and light fabric, but the style is not good for me.


This is the most comfortable dress.


True to size , very cheap quality material.


love this, but just a little too long in the back


I had low expectations for this dress but when I got it, it was beautiful. I'm 5'2 and curvy but It fit just right.


Better quality than I expected !  Cute dress.


Terrible fabric.  I am so disappointed I missed out on the return window!!! What a waste of money.


After getting the tenth compliment, I ordered two more in different prints. Very flattering fit.
