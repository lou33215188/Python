I'm 5'3, 155 lbs and a 36D and a medium fit perfectly. This is now one of my favorite dresses to wear. I get compliments every time I wear it and the print is even more beautiful in person. Absolutely love, love, love this dress!


Beautiful and flows! I received a ton of compliments with this dress. I'm 5'7 160 36C and ordered the Large. It fits nicely over the bust, and honestly could have got away with a Medium. Added a belt and cut the hanging cords.


This is a beautiful,, well-made dress. It has a Flattering design and Lovely embroidered details. Highly recommend. I may purchase more.


Adorable and very flowy!! Came horribly wrinkled but I'm still a fan, and spraying it with a squirt bottle and hanging to dry removed FHE wrinkles!


I love these dresses!!  I ordered 3 and am going to order more.  They are so flattering and all the prints are fun!  Sort of casual, but I can see living in these all summer.


Vibrant colors, good quality material and workmanship. Perfect fit


Perfect fit, color, and I got many compliment on it.  Great for casual, church, crusing...


Chest area is too small if you wear a 38DD. I purchased a 2x


Beautiful dress and material.  Great fit.  Only problem  is, it's way to long. Had to take  off little over 12 inches. It's still midway  between  knee and ankle.


Love this dress.  Runs a little small but not too bad.  I sewed the front shut and it works ok.  Love the fabric and washed beautifully.
