Love the looks of the dress!  But way to long for me.  I will have to shorten quite a bit.


I LOVE this dress! 5'6" and the length skims the floor. 138lb size 6 and ordered the medium. Could have been a little smaller in the waist. I'll belt it or take it in myself.


What a pretty dress!  It does run long since I'm only 5'4".  It is floor length on me.  I will hem it up a few inches.  Incredibly flattering and comfortable.


Great feel, very flowing.  I'm 5'7", 185lbs, it's a bit snug in the chest, but I'm a bit large in the chest... 36DD, so maybe would fit perfect for some.


I LOVE THE FABRIC, THE FIT, THE WAY IT LOOKS ON ME! I was soooo pleased! I wore it as my Easter dress. I originally bought it because I needed a dress convienent enough for nursing my baby.


I ordered an XL. I’m 5’3” and have 36DD chest. It’s float and comfy and lightweight.


The print is pretty. I really wanted to like this dress, but it's just ok. It kind of just hangs there and makes me feel a little old lady-ish. Maybe it's just how it looks on me. I am 5'8" and ordered the medium. Also the strings on it were sown backwards, on the inside of the dress so they had to be removed.


Was a little large but love it anyway just wear a belt with it, A+


As much as I love the dress, it's too small through the bust. The body of the dress fit well though. It's wearable with a camisole though, so I won't be sending it back.


I get many compliments when I wear this dress. It is beautifully feminine! It will require ironing after washing. The washing instructions say do not soak and they mean it! The colors ran a little on the one I bought (the red and white floral), but with the way the print is makes it not too noticeable.
