Love this dress so much. Nothing wrong with it despite some tough reviews. Way cuter in person.


The perfect summer dress. I actually had to order a smaller size, I usually wear large but I had to go medium with this dress. Great quality


Loved this dress. Wore it to my daughter’s graduation. Many compliments. Thank you.


I bought a small in the light blue print and it fits perfectly. It’s light but not see through and flowy but still flattering. I’m 5’4” and 130 lbs, 34 C. The length is a teeny bit long but still wearable with flats without hemming.


Really loved this dress, so I bought a second.  It is very long.  I'm 5'4" and it drags without 2 inch heels.


This is one the best dress from Amazon.Good fit lovely flowery color.this is what exactly shown in the picture.I will definitely recommend this.For reference I purchased XS.I am 105lb weight  ,5'2" in height.Usually I like tight fit so i ordered XS. But You can go ahead with small also.


gorgeous, if you have a large breast size order larger dress size


This is a cute, light summer dress that I can wear to work or out with friends.


I was skeptical about getting a dress on Amazon, but I saw a store selling this exact same dress for three times the price. Its so cute in person, and I get a lot of compliments. I have noticed it does wrinkle easily.


The skirt is VERY full.
