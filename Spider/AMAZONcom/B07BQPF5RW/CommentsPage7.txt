It's a warm fall in the desert so I wore this dress today and I just didn't feel secure in it. I got compliments, and it would be lovely for the beach. But walking around the church campus juggling a toddler, infant, and diaper bag, I just didn't know if something was coming undone. The skirt gets verrry billowy in the wind, the top is lower than I would like (I had to bend over during the service to pick up something I dropped and I was careful to cover my chest with my bulletin), and the buttons are held by tiny elastic bands that I was constantly checking to make sure hadn't come undone (they stayed secure). I got the off-white color and my nude bra did show through a little in the back in the bright bathroom lights. It was also a little wrinkly from hanging in the closet. This dress may end up going to the thrift store eventually. It's not really my color anyway, and the material would probably feel sweaty in the hot months.


I love love love this dress. I ordered the pink style in an XL and it fit perfectly. I normally wear a 16 dress size and I am a 40D. The only issue I had was that there were gaps between the button holes in the bust area. There is fabric on the back side so it was nothing that a couple of safety pins couldn't fix. I wore it to church this morning and got so many compliments on it. It is not see through. I did not have to wear a slip. It is absolutely my favorite dress. I have already ordered it in another color.


I ordered several of these dresses in various colors. This review is for the tan and purple floral print. I am 5'3" and 145 lbs with fairly thick arms and legs and carry most of my weight in my backside/thighs. I bought this dress in a large. The fit could not be more perfect. The shoulders looked slightly wide when I first tried it on but after a wash, it relaxed and fits nicely now. Plenty of room in the chest without losing form or flattening out and then a lovely flowing away from the rib cage to the skirt. There are buttons down to the last 10 inches so I was glad to see that you don't have to have as high of a slit as is shown on the model. The buttons are loops which makes it so that you can see your skin underneath. However, there is a flap of material along the opening that I pinned at the top which covers the openings all the way down. Problem solved. I was only slightly disappointed in the color/design. The dress I received does not have a dark purple around the waist which would help give definition and the pattern does not match up on the sides. These are tiny issues that don't even come close to detracting from the overall look. Just some FYI. I washed and dried on gentle and do not notice any shrinking. Oh! There is a tassel tie at the waist that doesn't actually have any purpose and after one wash the tassel looked terrible! So I cut it off and the dress is even better without it!


This dress is amazing! The print is beautiful and the length is perfect. This dress would be great to go to church in or to teach in.


Firstly, I bought this with my own money, and receive compensation from NO ONE to write this review. This dress is awesome. The skirt is FULL, the bodice fits very nicely and washes great. I never put it in the dryer. It looks VERY EXPENSIVE on. I love buying inexpensive clothes from discount online stores to stay trendy and current But I hate the roulette of guessing if I am an Asian XXL or a Target Small. This fits like Old Navy sizes.


I really like this dress for the most part. It was true to size (I'm usually a M and I ordered a M). The fabric is light but not noticeably see-through. My only concerns is that I wish the bottom half of the buttons were just for looks but they aren't. The dress completely opens down the front and you have to do all those tiny buttons. Once you have them done though you don't have to unbotton/re-button them every time you wear the dress so that's not a huge deal. I guess the real issue with it is you need a slip under the dress, otherwise people will be able to see through the button holes a little bit, and considering they go from top of the dress to mid-thigh, you can't wear the dress without a slip.


1 star off because custom drying / ironing is non-negotiable.


True to color in the color I chose, I bought a Large and it is a smidge too big but I think will settle in nicely after the first few dryer mistakes. I'm 5 foot 3, 170 pounds, long torso and 32F bust, so I sized up because busty + buttons is usually a bad combo. Proooobably could have gotten away with a medium but I don't mind a little extra room for error while drying drunk.


These buttons are interesting, someone actually put in the design work to have about an inch of fabric overlap behind them so you probably won't be showing people your underwear in moments of gapping.


The skirt was surprisingly full, I hope you can see that in the picture. It IS a little empire but who am I kidding, I'm kinda chunky anyway so I'm not going to say it's 100% the dress making me look fat. And it is REALLY comfortable.


Now. You'll want to wash this on cold in a garment bag or it'll rip itself to shreds getting caught on its little tassel belt thing. And then you'll want to pull it out of the dryer before it's dry to minimize the amount of ironing you'll have to do later by laying it flat to dry. You'll still have to do SOME unless you want to look fine at 5+ feet and a slob at closer inspection. I'll probably take this route because I friggin hate ironing. But if I'm gonna go eat with my mom it'll be ironing time. You can see in the close-up that at the seams there's no getting around a little ironing.


Beautiful dress fit perfectly I love it ğŸ˜�


This is so beautiful! Comfortable! I feel great wearing this, very elegant, but relaxed.


I ordered a large so it would be nice a flowy around me and it is perfect. Not tight and not too loose.


I am 5'4" and 160lbs and when I first received this (large) it dragged on the ground on the sides. After washing it, it shrunk just a bit so it no longer drags on the ground! Perfect! I kinda hoped it would! The fabric is soft. There is just too much about this dress I love. It has a generous amount of fabric behind the buttons so you don't have to worry about gaps!


I plan to buy a couple more dresses. I love these so much and they fit so well, I dream of many more dresses. Haha.


The only thing I didn't like, the tie/tassel thing. Seen on the inside of the dress. It didn't make sense, so I just cut them out. No big deal.


Nothing like the picture! The picture shows lovely pastels, but the dress I received was bright and gaudy.  The ribbing at the "waistline" was halfway up my bumps. In the picture, the dress falls in nice gathers at the waistline, but the actual dress was flat and boxy.  Granted, I don't have the figure the model does, but the pattern should still be the same, albeit it larger!  I'm disappointed and returning the item.  I wonder where all the positive reviews are coming from?
