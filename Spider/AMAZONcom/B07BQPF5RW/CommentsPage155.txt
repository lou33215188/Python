Super pretty dress. very comfortable and light.


Love it. Fits as expected. Great color. Comfy. Flowy.


Beautiful dress!


I love this dress so much, very comfortable and pretty!


Dress was very uneven at the hem. Skirt is full. Front was much shorter then back and was very wrinkled.


I received so many compliments on this dress, it fits perfectly. The only thing is that it is a little short, but that is the style of the dress. VERY PRETTY! I ordered another one in a different color


Beautiful fabric. But the sleeves are super tight. I actually ended up sizing up (I'm usually a large), so my arms could be not so tight.


Beautiful.  It was a hit with my boots.


fits a little snug


too long for me I am  5'2 though


very pretty colors and prints though
