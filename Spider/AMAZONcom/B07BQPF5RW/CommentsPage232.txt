WONDERFUL DRESS !!!!  THE COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL !!!!!  THE MATERAL IS OUSTANDING,  FLOWS AS YOU WALK AND AS THE WIND BLOWS.  FITS TRUE TO SIZE  A+++++++++  CRAZY FAST SHIPPING A++++ AND A SMOOTH AND EASY TRANSACTION 100%


Beautiful colors and design but poor workmanship. Extremely long on left side short thru the front and right side. Too much trouble to return. Not worth getting fixed.


The dress makers forgot that women generally have larger busts


I really like the pattern and style of this dress. I usually shop at Old Navy, GAP, Banana Republic, Nordstrom Rack and Macy's so I guess I've gotten spoiled by the sizing of their clothing items. I usually wear a size L or XL which fits just fine but this dress runs very small as I ordered am XL and it's too small.  Sad to have to return it :(


I was worried that a medium would be too small and ordered the large and it's just a bit loose.  Seaming seems to be all good so far but we'll see if washing it changes things.  (I plan on gentle cycle with air dry)  Length hits the floor like I wanted (5'4")


Very light. Neckline is too low.


Cute dress, but cut small across the bust.  I am a 36C/D and the medium fit throughout the body but was gaping across the bust.  For $30, it wasn't worth altering or putting up with.


Returned this dress.  Wanted very much to love it, but it was impossibly small.  Lovely print too, but I could not wear it, it was that uncomfortable.


love this dress perfect for Easter


It's nice pattern very cheaply made very long!
