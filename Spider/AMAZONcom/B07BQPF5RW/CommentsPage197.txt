So beautiful and so comfortable! I received many compliments.


I love the dress ! It comes very wrinkled but it's worth the extra ironing time. Pretty. Colors are true match to photo


Beautiful material but really tight around the breasts


Had to return, because arms were too tight. Returned and got next size up and fit perfectly.


Very very nice hang & flow & beautiful to boot!


So love the fit and feel of this dress.  Compliments galore!
