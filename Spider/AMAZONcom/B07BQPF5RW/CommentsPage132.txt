This is the first time buying a dress on line--- and happy to say, it's exactly what was advertised,  very comfortable and looks really cute!


wife is happy. fit. look beautiful


It is a perfect fit, and I couldn't be more pleased at how cool and compfortable it is. I got the dress to wear to my sisters wedding the end of May.


IÔ∏è ordered same dress with long sleeves and completely different sizes-


Had to order a size up.


Lots of compliments throughout the day on this dress. But plan to iron!  I loved this dress so much that I bought another color.  Equally cute, and equally wrinkled on arrival.


I love everything about this dress, except the hemline.  It's extremely uneven, and not symmetrically uneven so it can't be passed off as a high low.  I'll have to hem it to even it out.  If it weren't for the trouble, it would have been a dress I would have ordered in other prints.  So disappointing.


Very comfortable, very pretty. Contrary to other reviews, the buttons go at least as far down as my knees.


Love the way it fits and flows when I walk.


wasn't crazy about the sleeves, but they were easy enough to modify. Also, the tassel around the waist fell off during first wear and had to be reattached. Despite the drawbacks, this is a gorgeous dress.
