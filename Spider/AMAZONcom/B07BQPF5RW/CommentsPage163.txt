So excited about wearing this to my brother’s wedding!! I’m a US16 and the XXL fit perfectly and is so flattering! The flowyness and thin material will be perfect for Tampa Beach in late March!


so cute


I loved this dress! I bought the pink flowery one and I'm a 34a, size 7/8 pants and I'm 5'1 and the medium fit me great! The dress is barely touching the floor. Yeh I could've gotten away with a small but then the length of the dress would've been shorter. I'm ordering another one!


Cute dress but definitely need to order a size up as it runs small & is fitted on top


I LOVE THIS DRESS! I am 5'4'' and weigh 130 pounds and am pear shaped (I carry my weight in my hips/thighs).  I ordered the size small and it fits PERFECT.  I have gotten compliments every time I wear it and I feel frickin amazing.  BUY THIS DRESS, you won't regret it.


Beautiful Dress


Amazing dress. I am 5'1 and it fits perfectly!!


The fit and style is perfect and I love this dress.


This dress is amazing! Every time I wear it, I get so many compliments. The fit is perfect. Highly recommend.


The dress is really very beautiful, HOWEVER, Ladies, order your normal size!!! I sized up and I'm swimming in it.
