Comfortable, lightweight, canâ€™t wait to wear in the warmer weather


Beautiful dress! I'm excited to wear it this spring/summer!


I love this dress but it just a bit too snug. Can I get a larger size in the same color/style?


The dress if very light and comfortable.  Thank you.  I will order again from this supplier.


My husband likes it.


I am returning it. It was incredibly small and not great quality. The hem was just serged, not turned under. It was cute, though, thus the three stars.


I read the comments, so knew to order a larger size. If I had ordered my normal size, it would have been too small. I love the dress--really pretty.


I think we can all agree that the style and print of these dresses are beautiful. I'm strictly giving my measurements for sizing purposes. I am 5'7", 175lbs with a pretty standard hourglass figure and went with a Large. I wear a 10 in pants, and a medium in tops with 34DDD bra. Personally, the dress does not sit as far down towards my waist as it does on the model. The elastic fits right below my breasts, but it still flattering. If you're larger chested, consider getting a large. I tried a Medium but because of my chest size, the elastic sat at an awkward spot. Hope this helps!


This dress is so pretty, perfect for a nursing mama.  Will be ordering in additional colors.


Love the dress but it fell apart in the wash.
