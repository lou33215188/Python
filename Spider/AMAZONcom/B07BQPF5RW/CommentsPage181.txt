better than expected! Love the material! soft and comfy, well made dress! I am 5'6, 130 lbs and a small fits me perfectly. I will be buying more!


Love this dress! However, iâ€™ve Had to repair the drawstring at the waiste that was detached when it arrived.


The material is soft and feels great. I love it and intend on ordering more in different colors.


It does not match sizes at all.


Love this flowing and flattering dress!! Just wish I got another colour


Thank you for making such a fantastic simple but exactly what I needed .


I had to give it away  I could not return it because I could never get an INVOICE


Chest size way too small


Very comfortable. A little long but I purchased it to wear at home. I'm a petite person and although this normally wouldn't fit me, it fits great now cause I'm about 6 months pregnant. I'm 4'11. I bought the SMALL size.


Buttons were not lined up properly and had gaps
