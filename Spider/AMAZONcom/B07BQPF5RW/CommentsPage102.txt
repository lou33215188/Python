Beautiful dress, love the buttons.


If I saw this in a store I would be willing pay $100!


Great material. Perfect length, I'm 5'3


This dress is beautiful. While it's lightweight and free flowing it is not see through. I'm 5'4", a 38C and about 170lbs. I ordered a Medium, it fits just right. The length is perfect, I can wear flats and not trip over the dress. I will be ordering other patterns of this dress.


Light, comfortable flowy. Cheap what's not to love!


Even though it wrinkles just looking it it, I love it. It's s so feminine and soft looking on.


I bought 3


This is a really pretty dress.  I love the color scheme.  I'm 5'0" 118 and i ordered a small and it fits nicely.  The only issue i have is the length... which is to be expected since I am short.  I'm planning on getting it hem.  Other than that I really do like this dress.  Shipping was fast as well.


Looks beautiful in photos, super awkward on. The sleeves have a weird puffy ruching at the top- very Little House On the Prarie... the print was pretty but there was waaaay too much material in the skirt- it looked like a circus tent. Unfortunately I had to return


I'm tall (almost 5'11") with long legs. This did not look right on me. Returned.


Not a bit as the picture and the description. I love to buy in Amazon, but I t won't be buying ladies clothes again ever. The description are far from what they realliy are, and the sizes are deceiving. Generally.


I love it  Fit so good


I sized up based on the reviews and size chart, but a Small was too big for me.  I received a lot of compliments as the dress is very pretty, but you do get what you pay for.  The fabric is on the thin side so I had to wear a half slip.  Some of the button loops were ripped, thankfully towards the bottom of the dress so I just left those open
