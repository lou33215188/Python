No structure whatsoever.


Beautiful dress!


Love everything about this this! It's just right for the day to day here in SW Florida!


really pretty dress and I was excited to get it! However when I put it on, the top was to small then the elastic section was higher then I expected.


Perfect fit and beautiful, light flowysummer dress, it feels like wearing air!


Not for big busted women


Cheaply made. Buttons are with elastic and makes it pull at chest.


Perfectly fits on me, love the color and the design. Planning to get another one.


Returned. Not what I wanted, too casual.


I ordered a small  after reading reviews on sizing. I normally would have ordered a medium. The small was perfect!
