It was loose but comfortable and really pretty


Love the dress but itâ€™s way too small. I would suggest going up a size or even too. I have a big bust and the buttons seriously did me no favors. No give in the dress at all.


Super cute! A bit see through and the top fits a little large.  If you are typically a medium in tops I would recommend ordering a small.


Does run a little small. I ordered a medium and a large to compare the two and I went with the large. Very flattering on.


pretty dress, fits great, flows nice.  Just as described, and it was not expensive!!!


Cute fabric. Buttons keep coming unhooked and there is a gap - leaves you exposed. Glap between closure is due to too much length in loop, leaves you Exposed from top to bottom.


BEAUTIFUL dress but way to small, Will have to return.


I'm 5'4", a fit 140 pounds, and wear a 34D. I bought a medium and it looked like I was swimming in it. I chose the medium based on the size chart and reading lots of other reviews, so I hope this helps someone else avoid my mistake :)


Love it. Summery, cute and comfortable.  I could live without the cheap looking tassels though. Maybe replace them with a ribon or a string of the same material as the dress.


Arms a bit tight... But do-able.
