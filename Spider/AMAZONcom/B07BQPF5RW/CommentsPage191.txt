I have 3 of these dresses now and plan to buy more (all different fabric patterns of course). I get compliments on all of them but the red one gets the most.


Love this dress, fits well, the red is that wonderful true red that's on the deeper side as to not be bright. Nice and light too!  I'm 5 6" and about 180 and ordered an XL


I have weird, petite measurements, but this dress still fits and makes me look like a spring princess. As long as I wear heels.


I love this dress!


Love this dress. Ordering another one in a different color. Got tons of compliments!


Smocking at waist makes "bust" size irrelevant - I ordered up 1 size and it's still too small! So disappointed because the dress is really cute.


The dress fits beautifully... loved it


Very pretty--flows well! Be careful with size--go a little bigger


Cute, but if you have a large chest, don't buy this dress.


Pretty color. Very flattering.
