Love this dress.


Very flowy and flattering. Wrinkles easily but not too noticeable because of the pattern of the dress.


Loved the fit. I'm 5'4, 150 lbs and the medium fit just right. It was not too long. I was able to wear flats. I will be ordering other colors.


The fabric is a bit thin, I'm actually a little worried it will shrink if I don't hang dry it. Other than that it's beautiful. I'm a 14 dress size, and have a 38E bust size and the XXL fit well a little loose but it will look nice with a white tank dress underneath and cute summer wedges or sandals.


Bought this because I saw it in a Buzzfeed video. Couldn't be happier. It looks great on plus-sized women!


Pretty and comfortable dress.


The waist was fine.  But want cut for anyone that might even have a slight bust line.


Soft, flowy and comfortable fabric.


The print was not the one pictured, even though I  ordered a size larger it did not fit, and I'm having a hard time returning it.
