The dress is so cute.  I was able to wash it on delicate with little ironing.  First night I wore it,  I got compliments from the bf and my friends.  Two of my girlfriends went online and bought it right away.  I reduced a star only because it wrinkles easily.


Beautiful dress and feels very comfortable. I have recieved many compliments. I am 5"3" 147lbs. I ordered a large and fits well. Although I did alter it from the bottom was too long.


This is a really beautiful and unique dress, I wore it to work and everyone loved it. I recommend this dress.


I really like this dress. Itâ€™s a bit big and see through though. Wearing dark undergarments helps.


I'm 5'4 ,136, 36c and a small was just a little loose but fits nicely . I would probably get an x small next time so I don't have to hold the dress up from the ground. Beautiful dress tho. Very comfortable, and I get compliments all the time when I wear it.


I love this dress!!! I was really nervous about sizes as I am 5'5", 170, with 36DDD. So tops of shirts and dresses tend to run small. However, I got a large (which is my usual size) and it's perfect! There's still some space in the top so it's not tight at all!!! It reaches down to my ankles. It's completely gorgeous, and I might just order more.


I highly recommend it I bought my regular size M and it fit perfectly no need to buy a bigger size  the material is great and I have had great complement about the dress, I just love it !


Very pretty color, and comfortable to wear.  I will need to hem it though, I'm only 5 ft. and it drags the ground.


I love how this flows. I would buy it in other colors. It's comfortable and has just enough drama to make you feel like a fashion queen.


BEAUTIFUL DRESS. IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF A CHEST, IT WILL FIT SNUG. I WILL HAVE TO WEAR MINE OPEN, BUT I DON'T MIND. VERY PRETTY AND FEMININE ON!
