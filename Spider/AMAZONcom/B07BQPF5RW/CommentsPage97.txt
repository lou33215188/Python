Very long and loose. I m not short but it drag on ground


Like it. Material is a little on the cheap side but it fits well with lots of length which I fix by wearing heels


This dress is absolutely adorable!! I canâ€™t wait to wear in the spring and early summer months!!


LOVE this dress! As other reviewers have mentioned...compliments abound when I'm wearing this. I ordered an xl which fits fine just a little loose, and I typically wear a size 12 dress. I probably could have ordered a large, but the xl works fine too.


Kind of thin.  I don't like wearing slips. Also, runs a little small.


The reviews are correct, this dress feels very expensive, it is light and flowy.  I ordered an XL and it fits perfect


Wonderful fit and excellent product! It looks lovely when you walk in this dress! Must to have and wear durring summer!


Looks nice on the model. Too long and also too tight up front. Will have to work with it to make it fit better.


item felt moist as unwrapped from plastic bag. took a day to finally not feel dampness. tiny buttons can be a nuisance to work with, dress is as pictured and fit is flattering


I loved this dress it was just as pictured, but I'm only 5'3" so I gave it to a co-worker who was tall and lean.  It was such a good price, and looked so nice on her I just flat out gave it to her. Happy it is being worn by someone who appreciated its' beauty and wears it well!
