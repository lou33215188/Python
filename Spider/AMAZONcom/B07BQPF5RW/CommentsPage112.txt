Love this dress... fits perfect! It will look good even though I'm losing weight..


looks great on.. just a tiny bit small in the bust but i purposely ordered down a size.  Very wrinkled and does not steam free, so I will have to iron, it I kind of figured on that for the fabric and price.  Will definitely get some wear during the hot summer months, if I can find my iron!


the bust is a bit tight, but there is a material flap that can be tacked down behind the buttons. the rest fits fine.


It is a little short for my long legs (I got a medium and I'm 5'7


Too small waist line not where it is suppose to be too high and hits just under bust line


I really love this dress!!


Fits perfectly. Is so flattering! Looks better than the pictures! Going to buy more in different colors!


Trim the bottom to fit.


Defective. The neck line is all stretched out and lays funny. Have to send it back. I ordered this in a 4 different prints-- 2 were good- and two were defective. I wouldn't waste your time and money.


Comfortable, got tons of compliments and it wasn't too long for my 5'4 frame.  For the price it was fantastic.  I loved how full the skirt was as well, it was very flattering.
