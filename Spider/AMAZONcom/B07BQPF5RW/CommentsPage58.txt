Well...the dress is cute but if the buttons are all off and leave gaping holes it's quite useless. I gave it 2 stars because the pattern is nice and shape is flattering (if you can get one that's not defective) but for me I returned and didn't like it enough to try again.


So many conflicting reviews regarding size!!  I was very confused about what size to order!!


I ordered this dress in both the Purple color and Orange color in Size Large.  I am 64 years old, 5' 6" and weigh 166.  I was pleasantly surprised both dresses fit perfectly.  I generally wear a size 12 (misses) in TJ Maxx-priced dresses.  I am "pear" shaped and this dress does NOT accent my larger waist and hips.  In fact, it is surprisingly flattering because it skims the problem areas.  The "smocked elastic" hits me right under the bust, as it should, and as shown on the model.  This is an empire waist but does not look like a maternity dress like many empire waisted dresses do.  I do not feel dumpy in this maxi like I do in most!


The "Purple" dress is a patchwork print with many, many different, lovely colors and patterns.  It has lots of blue shades, some lavender and corals.  The predominant color is not purple on my dress.  I really love the print.  The buttons and elastic button loops are a light peach color.


Buyer Beware:  The bodice of this dress is not going to fit if you are larger than a  36 B or small C cup because this dress will gap at the bust.  The fabric fits like silk and does not have any stretch.  It does have a  one inch placket of fabric behind the buttons and that camouflages any really tiny gaps.


The short sleeves fit with ample room on my rather large upper arms.


Some reviewers mentioned a "puff" on the sleeve which is true and very noticeable on the Orange dress but not on the Purple dress.  It just depends on how the gathers in the sleeves were sewn at the factory.  I do not like the "puff" so I'm returning the Orange dress.


This dress is 100% Rayon, very soft and, YES, it will be wrinkled when you get it.  It had a slight odor.  Just let it air out and press it.  I do not recommend washing or drying this dress regardless of the "washing instructions" because it is just too delicate and apparently will shrink (based on many reviews).  The elastic loops for the buttons seem delicate as well so don't pull too hard.  The cord tassel at the empire waist (not a drawstring) adds to the "boho" look and I liked it, contrary to other reviewers.  Yes, Lots of buttons but I can get the dress on and off over my head by just unbuttoning 7 buttons.


Length:  I am just under 5' 6" and the length is just perfect!  The dress does not drag the floor on me and covers my legs.  The hem is slightly shorter in the front and a couple of inches longer in the back, shows a little ankle and buttons down to the knees.  No fear of a peep show and, although the fabric is lightweight,  it is not see through and you do not need a cami or a slip with the Purple dress.


It truly is a nice maxi length for a not so tall person, has a nice, fitted bodice for a not very busty person and a nice modest v-neck.  Great short sleeve for those of us who no longer wear sleeveless dresses or tops.  I bought this dress to wear to an outdoor, daytime, beachside (not in the sand!) wedding in Mexico over Labor Day and plan to wear a 2 or 3 inch casual wedge or chunky heeled sandals.


I really love the way this dress looks and flows bit the bust was a bit tight fighting. I do have a large bust and that's why I went up a size I thought that would take care of the fact that I have a large bust but it didn't it was still quite tight on the top I was glad it had buttons because if not I would not been able to ware it. But as long as I keep a few of the top buttons open and ware a camie underneath then it looks very good. Thought I would share that with all my other curvy girls out there ğŸ˜�ğŸ’ƒğŸ�¼


Pretty but this dress is not good for big bust and smaller waist. The top had a inch gap between the buttons like I was about to burst out but the waist was super loose with too much fabric. Not a good look. I'm 5.4, 40D and usually wear a 10 pants..


Very beautiful dress. I read 'bad' reviews and not sure where those coming from. I am very happy with the dresses. Bought 2 of different patterns. It does not concern me that they come wrinkled - wash them and wrinkles go away. Love them all!


I think this would look great on a super slender body.. that's not my type of figure. If you're curvy, it just looks loose and boxy


Somewhat Large and very long I have to take it to the alterations place to cut the lower bottom and after that it was fine, I use belt to kinda feel the tightness of the whole dress, but I like it very much, the fabric is good.


Sleeves were so awkwardly short


Purchased my size but had to return and get size 2 times larger than what I wear.  It ran small in bust and arm areas.  Once I got a size that fit really love the dress.  I just need to hem it because its too long.


I am in love with this dress! I always get nervous ordering from a new vendor on amazon cause you never really know what youâ€™re going to get, but I am so glad I did. Itâ€™s flowy and comfortable, and does not need a slip like some of the other patterns of this dress. Itâ€™s a little big around the waist, Iâ€™ll be ordering a second dress in a different color but going down to xs.
