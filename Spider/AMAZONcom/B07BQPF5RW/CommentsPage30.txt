This is the strangest dress that I have ever worn. The top if very tight fitting but the bottom is VERY full. The slit is only open from my knees down, which was a concern for me. The fabric is a little scratchy and really thin, but it is suppose to be a summer dress. The floral print is not near as pretty as I'd hoped it would be. I will definitely have to wear a cami under it to cover the gap in the middle.


I may end up returning it, I haven't really decided yet.


I got many compliments on this dress. I wore it to the beach and it was absolutely amazing. It is gorgeous. The material is perfect. I want to find a belt so I can wear it other places because it is lovely. I am in love with this dress. Will buy other colors once I lose a little more weight.


Btw, I'm 5'3 and usually wear 14/16. I bought a 2X because I have boobs(40DD) and butt I'm still holding on to a little baby weight, but the 1X probably would have fit just fine.


I wish I could give this 10 stars. It is such a pretty, flattering dress. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly, not too big and not too small. The fabric is pretty and flows. It is very comfortable and it doesn't need to be ironed! I always get compliments when I wear it. I never have to wear anything under because the fabric is light but not see through.


Highly recommend it.


BTW I'm 165lbs, 5'5, busty and hippy. Hope this helps!


This dress is ultra flattering!  I purchased one size up as recommended and it works fine...mostly for the chest area.  If you get it too small, the buttons would pull and it wouldn't look right.  It's flowing and feminine and perfect for spring, summer or fall.  I absolutely love it and plan on purchasing some more in different patterns.


As a side note, it's quite long, even for me, and I LOVE maxi dresses.  You will probably need at least a 2-3 inch heel if you are under 5 foot 5.


I am 5'4" 145 lbs, I bought a size small in the red and white floral pattern. It fit fine and was the perfect length with a 1-2" heel. I loved that it is very flowy and light for the summer, but I did think it was a little frumpy on me, not super flattering, just ok. I was only able to wear it once though! The first time I washed it (cold water delicate cycle), the red bled onto the white flowers, so there were pink/red smears throughout the dress. :(


Pretty dress and it fit well  but arrived very wrinkled.  Rather than iron it, I turned on the shower to get it wet and allowed it to drip dry.  The next morning,  the tub was stained black from the dye that had dripped with the water.  I will try washing it on gentle but not with anything else in the machine.  I'm not about to risk an allergic reaction to the dye. If I can't stop the black days from bleeding,  I'll be returning it.


Fun dress!  Long and soft and flowy.  I got XXL- would normally wear Large or extra Large depending on dress shape (im well endowed with a big booty).  I'm a 38 DD and it's pretty snug in the chest. The hooks that the buttons fit into are elastic so it has some give, which is cool.  I'm basically just barely pulling the top off, but it's flowy and fun and pretty forgiving.  If you're like me and have huge boobs that never fit in anything I'd go ahead and get the XXL.  Update: I've received so many compliments since wearing out, just ordered another color!


Oh my gosh, I'm sooooo happy with this dress!! I ordered it for a wedding last minute and I was worried I would end up not liking it somehow or maybe it wouldn't fit me right, but it's perfect! I am 5' 2", about 145 lbs, and a 36 DDD - ordered a large and it's perfect besides the fact it's a little bit long. I probably could've ordered a medium and it would've been more form fitting, but I love the way the large fits on me because it's just the right amount of loose. I'm really self conscious of my arms because I feel like they're really big, but I love that the sleeves are loose and they cover enough of my arms like a t shirt would. The material is great, perfect for the summer. Very flowy. It's beautiful and a great price for the product you get! I'm gonna order a couple more in different colors


So I wasn't sure what to expect with this, as the one I really wanted was out of stock ğŸ˜‘ So I ordered the pink flowery one, hoping for the best and I was not disappointed. When I opened the package, it felt kind of moist and cold (nothing a run through the delicate cycle couldnt fix) so I was nervous but when I put it on, I was shocked at how amazing this dress is. For reference, I ordered my normal size, a large, and I am 5'3, 175lb and have bigger shoulders. The arm holes don't constrict at all and I feel amazing in it!!


Fantastic dress! Prints are gorgeous! I bought 2,  the pink and white and pink and green. Nice, soft fabric with flow. I will hand wash it. It came with a lot of wrinkles. I dipped it in warm water, 30 minutes, and hung it to dry and wrinkles were gone. It was slightly long on me for a midi because I bought an extra large and I'm only 5' 2". Fine with heels but too short for Flats on me
