Sleeves a little small, nice material, was missing a button on the dress but came with 2 extras. Full chested girls ok! Button closure is elastic and has some lining so no skin showing!


runs small so go up a size and then you should be fine. Love the fit and feel great for spring and summer.


It's a nice summer dress .. looks like picture and sizing is correct .. only issue is the buttoning in front gets streches out but other then that really cute dress


I have 3 of these Milumia dresses in the longer sleeved option, and I LOVE them! I decided to get this short sleeved one in the same size, and while it’s pretty I’m returning it due to the length being completely different. Also it is very see through. Disappointing :(


I am really impressed. This is beautiful! Fits pretty loose. I usually wear a large in dresses and that's what I ordered. I can't wait to wear this out!


I am 5.11 tall and this does not fit properly around my breasts. It is beautiful and would probably fit the average height women perfectly


This was my favorite summer dress this year . Every time I wore it I got loads of compliments and people wanted to know where I found it . I hope they bring out this style and other fabrics .


Cute but XXL only for skirt  NOT for top. Fabric ok but had no give as expected.


I was so unsure about this dress.  This dress fits great.  The fabric is a little thin and then again a lot of  women summer dresses are.


Looks better in person!!!  I absolutely love it, can't wait to wear at a wedding.
