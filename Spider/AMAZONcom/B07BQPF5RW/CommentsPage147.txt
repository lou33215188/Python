Love it


Oh. My. Amazing. This dress was such a hit! I was able to wear it for my sister-in-laws baby shower, and I plan to wear it again and buy another dress!!


Very cheerful print and comfortable.


I just took this out of the package and put it on. It’s love at first wear! There is a reason this has gotten such rave reviews. It is CUTE and FUN and TWIRLY and COMFY! Get one!  (Or two! I’m ordering one for my daughter right now.)


Love, Love, Love this dress! I get compliments in it every time I wear it. I ordered 2 sizes up from what I would usually (large in most things ordered and XXL). It's nice and flowy with room for my baby bump to grow. Thinking of ordering one of the other patterns.


SO. COMFY. I bought this for my rehearsal dinner and it was so comfortable! I made some alterations to it myself because the one I got was a little mumsy. I ended up removing a few buttons from the bottom and triming the backing to make the slit higher. I'm 5'8" and the slit was well below my knees. It did not exactly say "young bride-to-be". I don't love the sleeves, they poofed a little bit and were very 90's, but my hair is long enough to pretty much cover them. Overall, happy with the purchase. Again, I cannot stress enough how comfortable this dress is!!! Plus, the amount of fabric in the skirt makes it really fun to twirl in, so that's a plus.
