Too small at the top. Ordered size bigger than I wear too.


Absolutely beautiful dress, nice quality for the price!


ran a little small but very nice


Run's small but I can work with it.  Pretty cute.


A LITTLE TIGHT IN THE ARM, BUT A NICE DRESS


Love the dress, hate the sizing.  Sizes are not even close to being as presented.  WAY too small.


I normally wear a medium but I got a small and am very glad I did. It fits perfect! So flowy and pretty! I can't wait to wear it!


I get stopped every time I wear this dress and asked where I got it. It's beautiful. I've ordered 3 more for my daughters who all live in different states, they all wanted one too. You're going to love it.


Beautiful dress. I wear a 14/16 so I ordered an xl. Tight in the bust and gapes at buttons. ğŸ˜Ÿ Very flowy and comfortable otherwise. I'm returning but ordering a size up


Beautiful and comfortable dress! I bought it for our cruise to wear to dinner and/or on excursions. Very versatile.
