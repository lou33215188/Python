Really loved this dress ! Liked the light material its really perfect for summer


I absolutely love this dress. The fabric is great quality and the dress flows really well. I ended up purchasing the wrong size, 5'5 165 and ordered a and am swimming in the large. Cant wait to receive my medium!!


Definitely a great buy!!


The stitching isn't high quality, but definitely worth the price! Super pretty, and very twirly! :) Also love that it is more modest, and you can unbutton as far as you want, or leave everything super modest. It is very light weight and cool even though it has lots of material.


I LOVE this dress! The material is smooth and cool and very flattering. I've received so many compliments on this dress and it's very well priced. I'm going to buy another one for my mother.


Pretty floaty a d modest for work.


Love the dress! Just FYI to the short girls out there - it is LONG. I am 5'1" and its definitely a couple inches too long. It's still wearable, but just something to keep in mind.


Lots of compliments on this one . . . Love it


Comfortable, beautiful, and makes you feel very girly! Love it so much :)


I loved this dress so much I bought 4 ones similar to it. I love them all. They are so comfortable and fit to size. Unfortunately, when I washed 2 of them the colors bled so I reordered and will hand wash and hang dry them. They are worth it.
