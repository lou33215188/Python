Got so many compliments


This dress is see-through. Comes out of the package all wrinkled. Not really worth the price. The paid reviews are obviously biased.


I love how flowy the dress is. I feel very feminine in it and itâ€™s exactly what I was wanting to wear for an outdoor wedding. In addition, I feel comfortable in it. Bravo!!!!


Cute!! Comfy and better quality than I would expect for the price. The prints are really vibrant and pretty!


I love the dress, however it was too small in the chest and too long for me.  The material and dress were beautiful.  If it had fit, I would have enjoyed wearing it.


I like bit for my size (m) but I keep it.


Great fabric. Great fit and comfy. Little long on. My 5'3 frame . Had to shorten.  Otherwise I would buy again


Was a poorly fitted dress.


too long


I really like this dress; it is feminine and comfortable.
