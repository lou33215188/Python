Was what I hoped for. I plan on ordering more patterns of this same dress.


The waist is not like on the Model.  It is quite high - like an empire cut for maternity.  I'm 5'9" 160lbs.  I ordered a large. Fits ok in the shoulders, but that waist is REALLY high and awkward.  The kids said, "Mom, it looks like religious frumpy".  Returning the dress. Not giving it away.  Fabric was cheap and it wrinkles very easily.


Elegant flair, nice print, good material, comfortable...


beautiful dress


Fits perfectly! Love it!!!


I love this dress. I received it in the mail earlier than I expected.


Material felt nice. But the white/Black dress was very much see through.


the left side is longer than the right side. will be returning.


If your busty, probably going to be too small.


Nice summer dress,
