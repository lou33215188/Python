Beautiful dress! So excited I took the leap and bought it! So flowy and soft!!!


Unfortunately I am low waisted so it doesn't fit me property.


Beautiful colors, comfortable fit.  Flattering for my smaller chest.


Love this dress! Fits great and is flattering, would buy it again for sure!


Dress was alittle too long but fit well overall


This dress is poorly made. It's very thin and WAY too small! Will never order again


Love this dress! I'm 5'3 so the length was perfect for me.


You can see straight through it, but with the right underwear it is fine.


Beautiful!  fits perfect! Just Love it


I usually wear a Large but accidentally ordered an XL, however after washing and drying, it shrunk the tiniest amount but enough that the fit is good enough.
