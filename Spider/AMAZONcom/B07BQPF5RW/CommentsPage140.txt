Fit is excellent. Beautiful dress.


This is such a wonderful flowy dress. I'm 120 lbs and about 5'3" and just had a baby so I wanted something that would hide my stomach a bit.  This will be a great dress for the rest of spring and into summer.


I have four of these dresses now! Need to wash with a little care, but the fit and flowy fabric are so flattering and comfortable. Nearly every time I wear them someone will tell me they like the dress.


I love the dress! I got a lot of positive feedback from friends! I have bigger arms and was surprised that it fit my arms so well! I weigh about 160 and I'm 5'4. I ordered the medium. The length was great!


Beautiful dress.  I am 5'9" and usually wear a 6/8.  I ordered the large and it was a little loose.  Just got a medium and it fits perfectly and the hem is at my ankles just like the picture.


Looks as good in person as it does on-screen.  Received it quickly and in good condition.  Wore it to our son's wedding and I was clearly the best-dressed one there (and I'm sure I paid less than anyone else!).


Lovely dress! But it is not wrinkle free...


Got so many compliments on this.  I read a lot of reviews that said it fit small, so order a size larger??  I wear a medium and ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.  LOVE IT!


Dress fitted well until first wash. The dress shrunk a good 4 inches


ORDER UP IN SIZE, I DO LOVE IT
