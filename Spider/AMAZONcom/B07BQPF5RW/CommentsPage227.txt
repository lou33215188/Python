Very comfy


Way too long!!


The top is too snug fitting for the dress size.


Love it.

First of all, this is a very pretty dress. I ordered the green in a medium. I am 5'5" 135 lb and this fit me perfectly! Wore it to a bridal shower and I received a lot of complements. Its flowing nature just makes you feel so feminine and carefree. Love this dress!


The only con I would say is that the fabric is a bit thin and the buttons going up the dress need to be ironed down so you don't run the risk of revealing more than you want. I wore a slip underneath just in case. But it's beautiful and for the price I really cannot complain.


It's machine washable and I always hang it to dry. It will need to be ironed occasionally since it is prone to wrinkling. But totally worth the extra effort!


Ordered bigger than my normal size and still too small


Too small


the bust was very tight buttons barely met


Love the dress! It is see through.
