Great Quality and great fit!


Too small in the chest


Too short


I love this dress! I got the XL when normally I'm a M/L because I would rather it be too big (oversized) than too tight. Plus I have a relatively large bust (34/36 DDD). It fits great! This size could fit a range of body types! So if you're afraid of the XL being too big, don't be. It sits comfortably on my frame, but I also have plenty of room if I gain any weight. The length is also quite long. I am 5'7" and it almost hits the floor.


super lightweight, very sheer fabric, didn't fit well enough to keep and felt a little cheaply made.


This was the most poorly made clothing I have ever purchased. It was a piece of junk and I threw it in my trash can. It is not worth a single star. Amazon should not include this manufacturer on its site. It hurts your reputation


I would love this dress if the size was correct.  The sleeves are so small, i cannot fit my arms through the arm holes.  I bought the XXL and the sleeves are what you would see on a size 10 dress.


Thought it was a little cheesy. Don't like it but too lazy to send back


Cute, but not for me.  I returned the dress as it is slightly different than pictured


I love this dress! It's flirty and feminine and I get compliments every time I wear it.
