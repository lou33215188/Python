Soft material, fits great and is very comfortable


I love it no disappointments!!


Great dress, light weight, pretty fabric and the right price! Material is almost sheer but okay. I am 5'10" and not just long legs, long waisted too. Hard to find a dress that is comfortable, but this is. Will probably buy another one.


This dress is a Beautiful! It runs long as I had to wear heels in a medium and I'm 5'6".


I loved it so much I ordered two more in different colors!


It is a really pretty dress, very comfy, and fits really nice! Im very happy with my purchase


I was pleasantly shocked by how amazing this dress is. For the price, this dress way exceeded expectations and it's sooooo flowy and it twirls like a ballroom dancing gown. I'm buying like 3 more.


I love the print and the fit is good. Complements my figure very nicely. The sewing on the gathering around the waiste was not what I would have liked. But overall, the dress is perfect for a vacation dinner in Mexico.


Wore it too my son's wedding!! Haven't ever had so many compliments! It was a little long but, oh well, I'm not that tallQQQ


Love this dress! So comfy to wear while pregnant and looks great!


I am a size 10 but ordered an XXL.  Yes XXL is a 10!!  But I'm very happy with the dress.  Light and breezy!!  Fabulous coloring.  30 buttons down the front!!
