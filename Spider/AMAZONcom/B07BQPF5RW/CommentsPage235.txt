Very Pretty Beach Dress


I love this dress!  I bought it to wear to a wedding.  Not sure that I will wear it there, but it is definitely a keeper!  So pretty, flowy, bohemian looking!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because - it's long.  I'm 5' 3" and it's basically a maxi-dress on me.  It's skimming the floor.  And those ties are really weird!  I saw another reviewer said she just cut them off and I think I will do the same.  Other than that I think it's a great summer dress I can wear out or to church or work.


So cute!  i love it!


I get a lot of compliments when I wear this dress.


Did not like way the buttons were not backed with an overlap flap on the lower part of the dress.


Material and workmanship quality bellow standard!


Returned it.


Runs about 2 sizes too small and nothing like the image.
