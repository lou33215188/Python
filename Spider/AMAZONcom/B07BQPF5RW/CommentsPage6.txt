This dress is AMAZING. I purchased it for my baby shower and everyone fell in love. I am 5'4", usually size 12 and size 36 D (pre-pregnancy) and the XL fit well. I am 8 months pregnant so I originally ordered an XXL to make sure but it was very big. I could have even ordered a Large if I wanted it to be more fitting but the XL was great. The length was perfect (I wore sandals so it did touch the ground), the fabric is well made, breathable so it's not hot, and has the tiniest stretch which helps around bust area. Best part is the arms are roomy! I am insecure about my bigger arms but that wasn't a worry in this dress. It is so flattering. My advice: ORDER YOUR USUAL SIZE! If you're a medium - order medium! If you're a large - order a large! There's enough give and stretch around waist that if you're between sizes it'll work out. Trust me! I'm gonna order more for my post-pregnancy wardrobe.


This is a real cute summer dress. I am 5'3" and the dress went all the way to the floor, otherwise the dress fit nicely. I cut off the bottom to about 4 inches below the last button keeping the same curve on the bottom hem where the dress is slightly longer on the sides. After hemming the cut edge about a half inch the dress is the perfect length! I bought this to wear to a bridal shower, plus my shoes will show now that the hem is just below the knees. Looks like I have a favorite summer dress now!


I added my own tan colored belt and 1-picture shows the dress without the belt. It is much more relaxed look and feel with just the empire waist elastic instead of adding a belt. The belt, I think looks best at the empire height, but my husband liked it at the waist. He does not look at much details though because the elastic wait on the dress shows too much with the belt set at the waist. Now I like it without the belt all together.


I had high hopes for this dress. The reviews were great and all he ladies in the pictures looked wonderful but I am so disappointed. The dress is cheap and not flattering. I looked pregnant. For reference I'm 155 lbs, 5'4. I ordered a large. The sleeves were snug. Not tight but had no give either. Everything else was loose and comfy but the way the waist sat, it looked like a maternity dress on. And the top button loop was broken. It's beautiful but just poorly made.


I am 5.1 n 108 pounds so I decided to get a size small with a color black and pink. It looked good on me but I think a little bit big. Then I want a second one x-small with a color yellow and green. It fitted great on me but the dress was damage. I decided to send back the second one. By the way, I love this dress.


I was a little nervous ordering this bc I got my normal size, and the vast majority of the other reviews said it was 2 sizes too small. I'm so glad I didn't listen to the reviews! I am 5'4", 155 lbs and the Large fit me perfectly, to give you an idea of what I'm working with. Even the length was perfect for flat sandals and I usually have an issue with that and have to hem everything or wear heels. The material is is nice and lightweight, which is great for these ridiculously sweaty summers. The cut is very flattering, the skirt is full and flowy, the arms are close fitting without being too tight, and the pattern is pretty and girly.


Items to note:


1) The tassel is for decoration only (it is not a drawstring) and comes out of the dress in a really bizarre place (at the bottom of my rib cage and several inches below the dress's waistline). I'm sure it could be easily cut off though if it bothers you.


2) The top button gaps a bit and so I believe I'll have to pin it closed when I'm around polite company.


3) It came REALLY wrinkly so steam it, hang it, iron it, whatever before wearing.


All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this dress, especially considering how cheap it was. This will be a new summer staple for me.


I was really excited for this dress as I wanted to buy something pretty to celebrate the spring. The dress looked flowy and the floral pattern was nice so I thought, what the heck. While I usually buy a S, I opted for a XS because I didn't want it drag down on the floor and I had recently lost some weight. XS was perfect in terms of height for my 5'4 height but it still felt too big and the bottom had more fabric and felt a bit heavy and clumsy to move around. There was also something off - oh! the buttons were the same colors as the dress instead of the brown ones picture - which I felt like the little detail actually made a huge difference. The dress is definitely cheaply made and the fabric is light and might be see-through if you are under the right/wrong light. I didn't feel like I wanted to add more more things to improve it (tailor/slipdress/new buttons). I am returning the dress, sadly. I liked it but I just didn't love it. I guess that's okay, because people do that with relationships too.


Love this dress! The material is light and flowy! I haven't gotten hot in it at all. I am 5'7 and weight 175. I normally wear size 8 in women's which is usually a medium. But I read the reviews and decided to order a size up. I got a large. It's a little loose and I probably could get away with a medium but I'm afraid it may be too tight. The waistband is stretchy but the rest isn't giving.


I bought another in a different print. ğŸ’•


I am so bummed! I absolutely loved this dress. Love the fabric, the style, the length, details, everything about it was perfect except for one thing- the size! If the size chart had been on, then this dress would have earned a 5! I ordered it to wear for a wedding that I leave for on Thursday and it arrived today on time, but the size was really off! I measured exactly to be a medium according to the charts- I should have gone with a small or extra small. I checked to see if I could overnight it to get it by tomorrow night and don't see an option for it. I am so sad! Really this is a gorgeous dress, but size down! I am a curvy 5'7" and 125lbs and the medium was baggy big- I normally wear a small and should have just ignored the charts. Wish I could get it by tomorrow night so I would have it to wear!!


Fast delivery. Beautiful dress, and sizing is accurate. 5'7 35-27-35 Size Small. Material is very light but not see-through. I bought two with different patterns, the seafoam colored one and the red and white flowered one. Unfortunately the color bleed with the red one, this deess was washed by hand and the red bleed all over the white flowers and now it's a patxhy red, pink and white mess. Very dissapointing.


It's so hard to buy clothes online, especially when you are trying to determine the size to order based on others' experience, fit, body style and preference. Of course, we all have different body types but based on the reviews of how this dress fits, it seemed a large number of people felt it runs small. I'm typically a size medium (size 8-10). I also have a larger chest (36D). After reading the reviews, I ordered up a size and purchased this dress in a large. I received this dress today and unfortunately, it's huge on me. Outside of this dress not fitting me, the dress itself is kind of cute but is extremely flowy in the skirt part. The skirt is really wide, which isn't the fit but the actual style of the dress. From my perspective, this dress runs true to size and it's best to order your normal size.
