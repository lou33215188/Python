It's cute. The top half isn't made for some one with a larger chest. Even with buying the next size up. Washed in cold, delicate and the red bled into the white flowers. A little pricy for that to happen. And not made for tall people


Love this summer dress!  It is too long for me (I'm 5'2"), but totally worth it to have it hemmed.  I'll look for more like it in other colors/prints.  Lots of fun to wear.


Fit as expected, BUT the sleeves were way too tight!


Excellent quality and soft. Made with pride!!!!!


This dress is beautiful!  I'm 5'4", 115 lbs, and the size small fit perfectly. I'm going to get it in more colors.


The colors are beautiful. I am abit worried about how it will wash as it is mostly rayon. But I have gotten so many compliments on it.


The product is thin and great for summer. The dress is beautiful. Some of the stitches on the dress is poor. Overall, it is a nice dress. It is quite expensive.


Love this dress!  I like the way it fits and looks except the bust area pulls apart. I am busty and will put in a few stitches to keep it closed. Very pretty color and pattern. I wear between a 14 and 16.


Love this! Fits great, comfortable and so many compliments! I will be ordering another if not more! Highly recommend this dress!


Love this style !!  A tad tight in bust area and a little long but with my wedge shoes it was fine ( Im 5'2 & a 38 C ) . Plan to buy more !!


I am five food and 145 lbs. I was worried about getting the medium but they were out of the large. This dress fits perfectly! It is comfortable and it makes me feel beautiful. It's a little long but with wedges it's fine!
