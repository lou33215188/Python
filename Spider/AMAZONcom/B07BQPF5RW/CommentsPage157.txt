As advertised, would buy again.


The red rope in the middle came all torn and falling apart, but the dress is pretty and flowy.


This is my fit into Dress! I love the color and style


This dress is very sheer . It was made cheaply and was very disappointed . Wear as pj's .


Although a little long (I'm 5'6" in my bare feet) I love this dress! Flows beautifully and is so comfortable. I simply hemmed it to the length I wanted. Easy to dress up or for casual wear. Love it for relaxed date night and I'll be wearing it to a late summer wedding.


Love it!


Nice!


I like the material, thin and soft. I like how it fit. But I ordered this dress in pink, and received it in blue. I would like to see that I am sent what I ordered.


Really poor quality.  I returned it.


Extremely happy with this purchase. I really thought it would be too loose and not fit me. To my surprise it fit perfectly and it’s sooo comfortable. Every time I wear it, I’m complimented on it.
