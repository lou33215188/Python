I liked the dress itself, but the buttons have elastic loops instead of holes.  Gapped across the bosom & there is nothing I could think of to fix it.  Returned it.


Not great sewing but works fine so far. Not terribly long on my short frame, but may still have to take it in if I'm not wearing heels. Very stretchy material, comfy. I wear with a belt.


it does have an uneven hem, though I can fix it easily enough. great color, isn't see through. It fits perfect.


This dress is so much prettier in person! I love this dress. It fits great and is a fantastic summer dress.


This is a cheap, flimsy garment with a terrible cut. The elasticized waist is where an empire waist should be. There is no purple in it, either. It's blue and orange. It's so bad that I can't even give it to a thrift store. I'm giving it to a dog shelter to be cut up into rags.


I absolutely love this dress wish I had ordered two. I am a 32C and it was loose for me wound the bust I should have gotten an xs but it's not too loose to where it looks bad at all! So many compliments on this dress I love it!


I loved this dress even more than I expected to. Fit great & many compliments on Easter Sunday. I will get another with a different pattern soon for sure


Comfortable, pretty and very flattering.  This will be one of my go to summer dresses.  Dress it down with flats and a messy bun or dress it up with some jewelry and strappy heels.


The dress is poorly made with cheap material and is quite big.  The fabric is stretched out so much, that you would need to wear a shirt under the dress, to maintain modesty.  I requested a refund and was told by the seller that they do not granted refunds, but they would sell me another dress in a smaller size for a discount.  No thanks.


Tight in the bust area and I'm small c the rest of the dress is flowy and very pretty I'm still going to wear it and may purchase a few more.
