The dress had a snag in the material and some sewing flaws.  I loved the material pattern.


Love it!!  Very flattering, and I love how it flows on the bottom.  Only problem was a small tear in the packaging, which went through to the dress... but I returned it and will definitely be buying another!


Gorgeous!!!


Love it!!!


they like it as much as i like it. the dress is so comfortable to wear.


My new favorite!! Fits and flows like a dream and the fabric is absolutely lovely. Almost perfect, except that the hem was much longer on one side than the other. No time to return it so I had it altered. Still have to give it 5 stars. Love it!


Was long on me at 5'3, but was gorgeous and got a ton of compliments!


Love this dress! Recieved many compliments.


Adorable dress. Bought it for a daytime wedding.. Had to hem it and it is just a bit large in the breast area. Wore a push up bra, problem solved!


It's beautiful and the material is so soft..love it!!
