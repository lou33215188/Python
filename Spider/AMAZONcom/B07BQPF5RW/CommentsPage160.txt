I like the dress I just wished it were longer. I'm 5 ft 7" and it stops short of my ankles.


Colors were way brighter than the pic and the fabric is so cheap feeling. The print is cheap looking. Returning, what a disappointment!


Great dress for summer parties.  I wore this dress on possibly the hottest summer days and felt cool with the airy design.  It does require a lot of ironing, which is why I've given only 4 stars.


Fits nicely just too long and almost tripped on stairs.


This dress is a winner. I have never not received a compliment. Its thin cotton, but not see through. Machine washable and true to its size.


Ordered 2XL and was way too tight in chest. Wear 44DDD.


This is a poorly made dress, I didn't like the fabric and it did not fit as expected.  I missed the return window, so now I have to find another home for it.  I will not buy from this company again.


Lovely dress! Looks very nice & the fabric is comfortable. I would buy it again in a minute.


Can't even get my upper arms through the sleeves. Flimsy fabric


My mum loved this dress. The quality is outstanding and worth every penny.
