Fit perfectly. Very comfortable and flowy. The material is very light and soft but doesn't seem to be see through. I am thinking about buying another in a different color.


Very pretty dress light and comfortable.  color was as described.  anxious for some nice weather to wear it!


It would be cute if it fit... really small in the torso.  Light floaty fabric, but order a couple sizes larger unless your small at the top.  And I don't mean bust, its made small in the rib cage too. The fabric has no stretch at all.


very nice dress but It was too small. I did follow the size guide but it would not close over my breast and I could not move my arms at all or I would have ripped the dress. REturned


So pretty. Fit great and the shipping was super quick! Such nice soft material. It will be perfectly cool for the summer.


Every time I wear this I get tons of compliments - it is a very pretty, flowy, comfy dress.  I like it so much I am probably going to buy it in another color soon.


prettier than in Pics..a bit too long, but can be shortened...soooo happy with it,  will order more colors...flowing, sexy fabric and very feminine


Buy one! These dresses are absolutely fantastic! They're gorgeous, flowy, feel elegant, and are super comfortable.


I am in love with this dress it is lovely. Every one loves it. I got so many complements which made my day, this dress made my day. Good material, amazing colors and it fits as expected. I will post pictures later


This is a very nice dress. Much better than I expected for the price. Mine arrived un-hemmed, it was just serged at the edge. I always need to adjust the hem, so that was not a big deal for me.
