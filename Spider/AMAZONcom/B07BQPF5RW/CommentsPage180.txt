Gorgeous dress.


love this dress


Great for the money


Love it. Had to have it hemmed but, worth it


beautiful dress, fits very nice


I want to wear this everywhere! Perfect for the beach, church, date night, or morning coffee! It's flowy and soft! Light weight and my daughters think I'm a princess!!!


Poorly made... Fabric ripped in two places just trying it on.


Not too bad


I'm a 36DD so I'm always worried about dresses that won't fit but I love it so much! Got it just today and it fits perfectly. I'll definitely buy more.


Loved it! Had lots of complements and it wore so easily. Flattering, fits to shape and my favorite color.
