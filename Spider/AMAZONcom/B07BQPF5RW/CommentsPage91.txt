Very nice, I needed a dress like this for lounging around when I went to Greece this summer. It worked out very well.


The blue color is not how it’s shown in the pics. I returned the dress.


i received my dress in tbe mail today, it was shipped quickly.


I love it! The material feels wonderful! The fit is perfect. I am 5' 5" tall, I weigh 160, I wear a 34C cup. The length is perfect for flats or small heels. The V neckline is perfect as well. I am very pleased. I ordred a Large


Really love the style and pattern. Based on other reviews and the sized information provided I went with an XL. I've got about 3" of extra room on both sides of the bust area. Other than that, it's great!


Runs pretty tight in the bust area and the length is long, but got compliments on it. It is see thru though


I like this dress overall - it's very very sheer - and long but floaty, nice material, nice generous button gasket to cover any gapping.  Nice - overall.


Love this dress. Very feminine makes me feel like a beautiful summer day having a picnic.


Great Design and pattern. The only downside is, I received this item with lots of creaze all over the dress. Also, dress looks kind of dull instead of vibrant as it has beautiful light green color and floral design. Wondering if can it be an old one? Anyone has the same experience?


The red and turquoise dress did not impress. It looks incredibly cheap and frilly with a lot of bright colors, not as the photo depicts. I’m a solid medium, but 5 months pregnant so I went up to a large. Felt much larger than a typical Large. I will be returning, bummer!


Pretty and comfortable. Based on reviews and size chart, bought in 2XL, usually wear a size 14 (34-36 B chest). It is a very forgiving dress, flows nicely. Must buy.
