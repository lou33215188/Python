Button loops are made of elastic. If u Plan on standing all night as a busty babe- excellent. I like to sit sometimes so then u could see between he left and right side of the dress-


Returning


I wear this dress quite frequently.  It is just a little dressy while being super comfortable.


GREAT dress, NOT SHEER . i wear a nude bra and spanks and you cannot see through it!


Love it.


Super cute and comfy!! I am 5'4" , 135 lbs and bought the small. The length is right to my ankles.


Perfect with my flat sandals


I have received many compliments on this dress. It's comfy but attractive. My only complaint is there is too much fabric in the skirt.


I really liked the dress. Sizing is not accurate. Too tight at shoulders and chest area. Had to give it to my daughter.


I bought this dress on shein.com and then saw this on amazon for cheaper. So i returned it and bought it here. BAD knock off. Not was I was hoping for. I should have kept the other one. I could tell when I opened the amazon one. The dress material was lighter.


What a great dress!  Fits pretty well + is very light + flowey


Beautiful. Flowy, flattering and comfortable. Needs a good iron upon receipt and if you have cleavage, requires fashion tape or under cover for chest area. However, perfect dress. Exactly as pictures and described.
