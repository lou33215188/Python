Good fitting!


Very beautiful, perfect fit and confy.


Fits perfect glad I measured myself before ordering!! Lovely print


The material is not very good and the dress is ill fitting - loose where it should be tight and tight where it should be loose


Love it


Very odd fit.  Too small on top. Disappointing.


I loved. ..is perfect!


Loved the fabric...it felt great...


I had high hopes and really wanted to love this dress. I am 5'3 and 1/2, 165 pounds with a 36d bust. I ordered a size xl based on the reviews/size chart. The dress came to my ankles, which is fine I can wear flats or heels. The sleeves fit fine and I like how it was gathered in the back. The issue was the front of the dress right under my bust. It is super flowy and loose and gave me the appearance of wearing a dress that was too large or something that looked like a tent even though the bust and sleeves fit well.  Due to this I did not want to try a smaller size because I knew the sleeves and bust would probably not fit. Sent it back for a refund.


Fits well , Pretty on
