I'm not a dress girl, but this dress is so summery and easy to wear. The fit is as I expected and the dress is made well


Lovely summer dress! Very happy.


nice as pictured


I got a size bigger, I should've gotten a large. It fits Decent though for an XL. Don't go an xtra size up, you need to keep your size. I am small at the top and big behind so I get a size bigger. Im like a s/m top and XL bottom.


It was super cute but I got a XL and as a 38DD was tight around my bust and the sleeves were too small for my arms ğŸ˜­ Beautiful dress though, I just gave it to a friend.


The dress had a hole in it.


The material is pretty and I could see this being a beautiful dress in someone else. The loops for the buttons are elasticy, so there is too much give in the bust for me. It gives the effect that I'm bursting out of the top.


Beautiful:) it is a bit short on my 5'9 frame. Mid shin. But it flows and the color is true.


Love it!  Trying to find more like this


Wonderful summer dress, fits great to your body.
