Loved the dress, just did not like the color on my complexion.


Beautiful dress.


Love love this dress! Light airy , very pretty !!! Fit me perfectly !!!


too small


LOVE it. Super cute and comfortable. You can dress it up or down, it is perfect.


love the dress but the material is somewhat thin. Also, the belt frayed after one wash.


Received so many compliments  :)


I bought several dresses but the fit was inconsistent.


I was expecting the sleeves to be a little longer. I do love the print and the colors in it.


Beautiful and comfortable.  Love it!
