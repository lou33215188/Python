It fit perfectly....until I washed it. It shrunk in the bust, torso and the arms. I loved the way the dress flowed.


Order a size up.


The dress is beautiful but is probably a size6. This is the last time I'll order any clothing that's not made USA for American  women. It also was not even folded just crumpled in a plastic  sheath


Love this dress..beautiful print, soft fabric and a very summery feel. I had to alter it to my height as I am 5â€™1..but with a little heel, it fits beautifully.


Really lovely!


As expected, the chest area was far too small, but when worn with a cami underneath, it's great. The skirt is incredibly fun, and the fabric is beautiful. I've already worn it once and received tons of compliments!


Beautiful feel and flow to it.


This dress is prettier in person than in the picture. Perfect for a summer event or date. I love it.


great summer dress


I love it!


Really love the fit and quality of this dress. Very airy and makes a great spring/summer dress. I am 5'4, 135lbs and ordered a medium. It fit too large, so I will return it and order a size down. I highly recommend this dress. It is well worth the money and so pretty!


Fits nice, pretty design, nice material
