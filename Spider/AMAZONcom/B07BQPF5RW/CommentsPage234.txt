Gorgeous dress! It arrived over a week early and fits perfect. Quality seems good too.


5'5" 109 lbs


Perfect length


Not see through


Beautiful pattern


Dress is  lightweight and perfect length. Received very positive comments. Love it.


arrived with a button hole ripped, and would need several alterations to fit like shown in the picture. not worth the time or money


I was so excited to get this dress only to be thoroughly disappointed. The dress sleeves bunch up at the shoulders and look really weird, the sizing of the dress is off, and the cut is off. Unflattering and poorly made.


Beautiful dress and so comfortable for summer evening wear. <3 it.


This dress is so beautiful and fun to wear. Feel great in it


Absolutely wonderful..!! This dress is perfect; the cloth is soft, it feels amazing, it's comfortable and flowy, the length was just perfect and it fits as expected!! I ordered a size up cause I wanted it to feel comfortable around the arms, but I could've gotten away with my same size.. I received so many compliments for this dress!! It was just what I wanted and what I expected it to be!! I will definitely be ordering more patterns of this same style! & more dresses from this brand..!! Amazing


One of the most flattering dresses i own.. love it.


Love the design and fabric, very disappointed in the sizing.
