I got this literally 2 days before my daughter's baby shower. I went over in jeans and changed after helping set up. Everyone loved it and I loved it. It was so soft and would flow when I walked


Beautiful dress! Very Classy and fit perfectly. My only drawback was when I put it on there was already a rip in the fabric which I was so bummed about. If I find a way to fix it it would definitely be my go-to summer dress.


You can use it confortablement! I'm a large person with 147 pounds. And it fits me PERFECT!!! I LOVE IT


LOVE this dress!! I read all of the reviews and most were good so I decided to order one! I am 5 3‚Äù, 128 lbs. and 34C. Ordered a small and it fits perfect! The dress is a little longer than I thought it would be, hitting just above my feet. I will be ordering in more colors!


beautiful dress, fits well, a little long but good for heels. have gotten tons of raving reviews whenever I've worn it.


This is literally one of my best purchases in Amazon. I never fail to get complimented when I'm in this dress. There's is nothing i can say negatively about this dress and I've had it a while it holds up well


Loved this dress so much that I went and ordered 3 more in different colors!!


The dress's elastic hit me higher than my waist, but lower than a empire waist. It looked like I had big shoulders and then the rest of the dress hung straight down. Think you need to be more curvy to make this dress work.


Too small


I bought this dress twice because I LOVE IT THAT MUCH! Fits perfect!
