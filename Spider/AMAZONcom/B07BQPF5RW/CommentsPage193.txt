Both of these dresses are gorgeous but too large :( I will be returning them unfortunately. Order a size down from what you normally wear, especially if you're a small


Love this dress. Fits perfect and absolutely love the flow at the bottom. I wore it to a casual wedding reception and received many compliments!


Love this dress and it fits well. May have to adjust or tack over breast area so it doesn't pull open because of the way it's made. Will order another on payday for sure!


Wife returned.


Really cute pattern and the material is thin perfect for summer. If fits everywhere except my breasts.  If you're busty girl you might want to buy 2 sizes up.


This dress is beautiful and just what I wanted for an upcoming trip. However, the size runs VERY small. I ordered a XXL that looks like a medium at best. Unfortunately, I will have to return this dress.


Nice dress.  It's a bit longer than i hoped, but it's pretty.  I love the colors.  Cute with sandals, or dress it up with some heels.


Very nice

Classy, comfortable summer dress. I ordered another in a different color. It does need to be ironed.
