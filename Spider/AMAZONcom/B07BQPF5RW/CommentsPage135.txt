I love this dress!  I have a bigger chest, so often dresses hang off my breasts and make me look heavier than I am.  But this dress hugged me in the right places, and is so comfortable.  Also, there is so much material in the skirt, it is so flowy. I love it!


Really pretty but not big enough in the top for DDD women.


I ordered a small.  Fits as expected.  I'm 5'1.  Will have to hem about 3 inches so it's not dragging on the ground.  Fabric is rayon.  Will need to iron after washing.


Beautiful dress. Fits my daughter who is a size 4 perfectly. Problem is I bought an x-tra large for me.


It is comfortable and pretty. Very thin,which I like for warm weather. Can't beat the price. It was wrinkly but it irons out.


I usually wear a medium, which is what I ordered and it fit fine. I'm 5'6"' and the length is great. I ordered more of these dresses.


Very pretty dress, but cheesy material. Need to wear something underneath, buttons didn't close right. Returned


Such a sweet surprise.  Love this maxi


Nice light and flowing dress.


I bought this dress for my daughter for Easter.  She loved it and it looked very pretty on her.


The sizing is way off...workmanship shoddy..sent it back
