Beautiful dress. Thin material though


I LOVE this dress. Looks like the picture. Very impressed.


Wife says "does not fit anyone that has boobs"


Lovely dress, that is why I purchased 3 of them.


I absolutely LOVE these dresses that I own them in 3 different colors and probably will get more. I get so many compliments when I wear them. It feels great and looks even more amazing!


Dress fit rather akwardly...way too loose around my waist, but probably would work with a belt.


I'm short so this length was not good for me but otherwise fit was really good


Cute dress and bottoms go down past the knee for modest women


It is long if you are petite (I am 5 ft 2) so you may need to wear heals if you buy this.


Soft, beautiful, elegant, amazing dress
