This is one of my Favorite dresses. I love it!!! Very feminine. I never wear it without many compliments


The fit of this dress is very flattering and very comfortable. I was worried that the white fabric would be too revealing or see through but it wasn’t! The only thing I would have liked better is if the tassels on the strings weren’t so matted. I ended up cutting them off because they were beyond repair.


This is a lovely dress and fits nicely. I love the feel of it.


I LOVE this dress.  Everything about it, The way it is depicted on website is accurate. Very flowy A little sexy.


I love these dresses.  Was sceptical because of the low price but the quality is good and I just washed one to see how it would hold up and it looks great.  I used cold water and very gentle front loader washer.  Dried on gentle for just a bit and smoothed any wrinkles out and hung up to dry.


Looking forward to wearing it do dinner at the resort in Mexico! I wish the slit was a little more pronounced but it fits great!


This dress is beautiful, I absolutely love it.  It's a bit long but that can be fixed.  i recommend this product.


I ordered a XXL. It fit  my daughter, who teeters between a med and a large. The dress was beautiful on her. It came un-hemmed. It washed well on the delicate cycle. We hung to dry. It was a terrific purchase. Just way small.


Okay so although it was a bit big on me where it was not flattering. This is a super cute dress. They were super nice and quick with my return so I plan to buy the dress again. I'm going to wait a little more as I lose more weight to get it.


Awesome fit.  I'm 5'7, 130, short waisted with  small chest and the buttons and elastic waist make it work for me.


First dress had broken toggle closures, but easy exchange. Material is decent for the price. Excited to see how it wears and lasts.
