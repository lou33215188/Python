It's a nice dress! I'm extra small and a small it's kind of big for me but overall it's nice dress!


I love this dress and good quality.


This dress is super cute! I got so many compliments.


beautiful dress, just as pictured!


I wear a size 14  I ordered a large.  This fits great everywhere but across the bust and shoulders. I want exchange for a extra large


Thankfully, based on other reviews I ordered a XXL instead of my regular size (Large). The XXL fit fine except it is too long, I'm about 5'3" and it drags the floor. with heels in may be okay.  The dress is not well made; there is no hem, just loop stitching around the bottom edge. The fabric is a bit thin but it is very soft and comfortable. If you don't order a large enough size the buttons will gap open due to the elastic button loops instead of button holes.  The dress felt slightly damp when removed from the packaging but did not have an odor as another reviewer experienced.


Sleeve is small  burst is small


Pattern does not look like the picture. Tie broke first time I put this on.


Awesome love ordered two more different ones


Love this dress fit well pretty much everywhere but a bit tight on the chest. Apart from that it's great
