I absolutely love it.


Quality seems okay. Very comfortable but seems to run a bit large.


It's beautiful i love it. These is a win


I love it, fits nice and  feels great


I received multiple compliments the first time I wore this dress! Very flowing.... just as it appears very comfortable and has washed well x1


Its nice but im giving 4 stars because after washing its become short


Dress is cute, but hem is extremely uneven.


It's a lovely dress, very casual.  It moves and hangs well.  However, it's pretty cheaply made and had an opening in the seam.


Pretty but cut way to small


I love this dress! I'm 160lbs and 5ft so when it came in it was too long so I cut 6"  off and hemmed it up and it came out beautifully!! Perfect!!!
