This is a very pretty casual dress. It tends to run a bit small.  I am 5'3", 120#,  and got a Med. It does run long as another poster mentioned. It almost touched the floor. For me that is not a problem, I am used to altering almost every thing I buy.  The skirt is very full and flouncy. I am glad I don't have to run from store to store to find a dress.


Love this!!! I was nervous after reading some of the reviews but found it to be well made and good quality. Got lots of compliments and felt amazing in it- soft and gorgeous, will be ordering more of a different color! The reviews helped me a lot so I want to include that I am 5'8", ~160 lbs and a 36 D/DD. And it fits perfectly and doesn't open up in the chest area. Bought a large.


Very pretty dress.  I love the front buttoning so you can adjust it according to the look you are wanting.  The red and white one in particular was exactly what I was looking for regarding the button front maxi you can wear (open buttoned up a bit from the hem) with a cute pair of cowboy boots.  The fact that this dreas has more of a cap sleeve than a tank or sleevless look makes it very cute.  Very good purchase.  I really love rayon fabric, it wears well and is so easy to care for. This dress is perfect in length for me- I'm 5' 6" almost and 135 lbs I went a large because I thought it would run small and I wanted the full fabric, flowy look;  it fits a little big but not bad, I could have gone with a medium.


Beautiful dress! Purchased after reading reviews. I ordered a size large based on reviews. I am pear shaped, 36B, usually wearing medium shirts or 8/10 dresses. I am about 5'5" and did not have any issues with length while wearing flats. Dress fit beautifully and worked with my somewhat heavy arms. I was concerned the opening would be too showy, but it was not. No problems with the buttons at all. It washed perfectly in the washer inside a delicate bag and hung to try.


It's perfect. I bought a medium, and it hits the floor, even with heels on it's a good length.  No "high waters" effect.  I might have been able to go with a small, but I think the medium fits just fine.  I'm 5'4" and 125lbs.  It's so comfortable.


The material wrinkles easily though, which I don't really mind. The fabric is so voluminous it actually works.  You will have to iron it after every wash, or after it's been hanging in the closet for a bit.  It is machine washable, the label said nothing about machine drying. I'd air dry to be safe.  But it probably wouldn't hurt it if you did machine dry it.


Absolutely beautiful dress!!! Totally worth the price!! I purchased this to wear during a cruise vacation. Very comfortable and flowy, yet dressy enough to wear to dinner. Easy to pack and wrinkles fell out after I hung it up in the bathroom during a steamy shower ğŸ˜‰ I got the 3/4 sleeve navy one and the slit was about knee level. It wasn't at all see thru and I didn't need a slip. I am 5'9", a size 12 to 14, wear a 38DD bra and got the XL to make sure the top part fit, but I could have easily gotten the L instead. I washed and dried it and it shrunk slightly but still fits a little loose. I'm going to order some more of these in L to wear thru the Summer and in Fall with pretty cardigans!


I'm 5'2 and 170 lb I got the pink one in a large. so it did fit a little big not too much but let me tell you it is super comfy. I love how light it feels and how flowy it is. i got really lucky with this dress everything was good. the fabric is a little see through so don't wear any bright underwear. this dress is so worth it, it covers enough so i feel comfortable and pretty. sometimes when i go to the mall i find close that open or cut in places i don't want the world to see. I will be buying more but in a medium instead so it fits better.  I will up date when i wash it and hopefully a picture.


I was a little nervous buying this dress; I haven't bought clothing off Amazon and some of the reviews mentioned it being too tight around the arms... I got it, and oh my god it's perfect! I ordered a Large (I vary between a medium and large in shirts/dresses and I'm a Bcup.. I'm 5'7 with size 10 pants) and it fits fantastic - if anything I probably could have gone with a medium. But it's flowy so it works! The length is fantastic (hits my ankles) and the material is insanely comfortable and NOT SHEER! It's going to be perfect for the rehearsal dinner I bought it for! I seriously couldn't be happier with the quality for such a price!!!


FYI I bought the short sleeve, floral print in red and white.


I cannot say enough great things about this dress. It is way prettier in person and is made of awesomely soft cotton. Iâ€™m only 5â€™2â€� and The dress hits the ground without being too long. The buttons go down far enough on me to not show too much of anything. I love that it has a blusher panel under the buttons to keep the bust area from bowing. And there are two security buttons in the center waist area to make sure the buttons stay closed. The neckline was perfect and isnâ€™t too revealing even considering my larger bust. The only drawback is the rouched elastic waist isnâ€™t right enough to actually make it fit flat, but itâ€™s also kind of nice because it keeps it from being restrictive or clingy.  I wore it to work and loved having the room to bend and move around. But itâ€™s also fun enough to wear on vacation! I am definitely going to get this in as many colors as I can.


Bought this dress for an LDS wedding last minute. Needed something relatively modest, but also wanted to look super cute. Bought a medium, normally wear a small/medium and probably should have bought a small, but went for a medium anyway because I have a 34D bust. The dress was a little big but fit nicely and shapely. The buttons are the cutest part and the slit at the bottom, which I was worried about, was actually relatively low and no problem. Super beautiful in person and can't complain at all. Got a lot of compliments and was happy with my purchase.
