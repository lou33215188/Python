I like this dress, It is pretty thin, and the weird strings coming out from the buttons at the waist don't make any sense at all. I will probably cut them off.


wife review- one of my favorite dress. love the material


Perfect beautiful dress .


I used it once, it ripped in my underarm. It's not even tight. Also, it doesn't fit very well, it's kind of distorted.


Love this dress.  I am 5'8" and the dress hits me right above the ankle. Very "flowy" and feminine.  This is my third purchase of this style of dress.  I recommend a slip for the lighter colors, as there is definitely see - thru with back lighting.


Great quality but pattern not exactly how I pictured


So pretty! I love the flowy look and feel.


Dress is super cute, but the sleeves are very small for the dress size, I am going to have to have a tailor see if they can fix the sleeves in order for me to wear it


This dress is simply awesome got many compliments when I wore this.I was so happy and enjoying this one ,this is my first maxi dress :):):).


The quality and color is perfect.I am 126lbs ,5'4 bought size small fits me a tad bit loose but that's manageable.


I love the dress! It's very pretty and is made of sturdy yet light material. Shipping was fast. The only thing is the dress is very wrinkled and smells like vinegar. The lenght of the dress is perfecct. I'm 5'6" 160 Lbs and ordered a large. It fits perfeclty. Even in the arm area which is what i was worried about.
