LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS!


I'm between a small and a medium. I bought the medium to be safe and it was too large. The shoulders are very wide. I am smaller boned. If you have wider shoulders this size would have been perfect.


So this dress is adorable. It's flattering and light and flowy, but I have one huge complaint. The hem is incredibly uneven. I'll have to get it hemmed, but otherwise, it's an awesome dress for summer.


Nicely made with a lot of detail. Fabric might wrinkle. Pretty, hangs nicely.


I love this dress! I'm always hesitant to wear maxi dresses in the summer in Arizona but this dress is super lightweight and comfortable. I'm definitely buying other colors!


Stylish and simple features femininity of the bodyğŸ’”


Beautiful! Might be a bit tight around the bust area for larger girls but you could leave it unbuttoned and wear an undershirt


I love this dress, so gorgeousğŸ˜˜


I almost passed up this dress because only the pink was available (at the time I ordered) and I wasn't crazy about the print at all. But for the price,  I thought I'd go ahead and grab one.


I really glad I did. It is SO comfortable,  and it flows/moves beautifully. It's just got so much swing to it. Light and billowy. Pictures can't do that part justice.


I knew it would be long on me (I'm 5'0) but after a wash it shrunk up enough so I could wear it without touching the ground. I do think that it slowly stretches back out after the shrink,  though. Seems to get longer again as the day goes on. Probably the weight of the fabric.


I like that it had an elastic waist. And I really like that there is a piece of fabric that lies under the top row of buttons, in case it gaps when you lean over,  or the buttons pull a little.


Even though I'm still not in love with the print, I'd definitely buy this again. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. I'll be buying another, since I see it is available in other prints, now!


Little tight through the chest area.
