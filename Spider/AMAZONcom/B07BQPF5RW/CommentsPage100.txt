I am pleasantly surprised! I love this dress!! The fit is perfect, it's flowey and beautiful. I am 5'9 and got the large, and it fits great. I will definitely be buying another color. It's going to be perfect for Easter, Mother's Day, weddings, etc.


Fantastic dress! Ordered the green dress as shown, 115lbs 34c  5'3 ordered a small and it is perfect, plan on ordering more soon. It brushes the tops of my feet


The dress was really cute, light weight and comfortable. Unfortunately the event I needed for was canceled so I never got wear it as it is a summer spring dress and I purchased it in November. You don't need a slip with this dress either.


I love these dresses.  I've got two and they both fit, but a little differently.  If you're in doubt, go for the smaller size; it will be more flattering.


My new favorite dress! Perfect for hot days. Its light and comfortable. I plan to buy it in more colors.


Order two sizes up from my normal and according to the guide lines. Glad I did as it fit across my chest perfectly. My normal size would have been way to small. Love the dress. Material is light and aiery making the dress flow gracefully. My grandson said "you look like a princess ".  Love him and this dress.


The teal floral print was not the same dress compared to others i had previously ordered. HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT. the dress was shorter and it didn't have the extra flap to not show your bra. This style was a cheaper knock-off version. Order any other style or print.


Lovely dress. Fits well. Got lots of compliments too. The only thing I did not like was the knot in the front.


Love this dress. Fits my size DD breasts. Long enough for my 5'10" frame.


This was a gift for my daughter and she loved it.
