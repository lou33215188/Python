This dress was beautiful. I wore it once and got many complements on it. It fit perfect. I washed it as instructed and it fell apart. I was devastated. Amazon issued me a return.


It was a little wrinkled but nothing a good ironing couldn't fix. It looked beautiful on me. So glad I read reviews about sizing. I normally wear a L or XL. Ordered the XXL and it for perfectly.


This dress is really cute, but even though I bought the right size according to the size chart, it was too small. I've decided to lose a few pounds and keep it because it is so cute!


Absolutely stunning dress. It fits really well. I get lots of compliments on this dress. I'm 5'4, 129lbs, 34D.


I love this dress. I am giving 5 stars even though it is a little too large because I only ordered 2 sizes up due to all the reviews saying that you should. Honestly I would suggest possibly only ordering 1 size up if you do. This dress is super comfortable and have a lot of room for moving around in. It was great to wear and I received many compliments from it. Great price that you can't beat!


So cute! I got so many compliments.


In the bust area it is a little tight.  But it really is beautiful...


Just love it. Lovely material and has a wonderful full skirt. The colors are gorgeous and Makes my figure look good


Beautiful soft flowy dress. I bought 2 because I couldn't decide on the print..I'm keeping both!


I like this dress very much but the front side below the buttons is a little shorter than the back side of it.  in the picture you cannot see it,  may be that's the design
