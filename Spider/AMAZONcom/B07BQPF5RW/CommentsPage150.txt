Fun summer dress. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. I do pin it because I don't quite trust the buttons (There are tons of buttons)


I was expecting good quality material but it's not good quality as compare to money spend..and item was packed like garbage so it has so many wrinkles. It will take few hours to iron out these wrinkles. Item fitting as expected.


Perfect dress for beach !


No where near fitting. Very disappointed in the sizing. I normally wear a large and sometimes xl. I know many clothes sold on amazon run small so I purchased a 2xl. TOO SMALL


This dress fit perfectly and is very cute.


I absolutely love this dress, but I read the reviews and order a large as suggested by other buyers, dress was a little too big. It has an elastic waistband. I'm exchanging to for a medium, I really hope it fits well.


Love the dress!! Very flowy


It is gorgeous but the arms are easy too tight.  If the rest fits like a 2X then the arms should as well.  They squeeze my arms. I going to have to alter the sleeves


Very poor quality.


Wrinkles easily. I am 5'4" and it was very long. Other than that? Quote pleased.
