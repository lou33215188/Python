I love this dress! I am 5'7, 120lb, 32D, normally wear a medium/6 and the small is a little too large. Will be returning for a XS but it's great otherwise! Length and material are perfect.


Beautiful print but size chart is way off at least for the top.  Can't even button across my chest while the rest fits okay and I'm not that well endowed. Bought it for a specific occasion and didn't have time for something else so ended up folding the top down inside and wearing it as a skirt with a different shirt over it.  Not what I planned at all but it worked out.  Will never buy again from this brand.


I was skeptical about this dress because I saw several negative reviews but I was in a time crunch to find a dress for an event in two days. I'm happy to say that I'm pleasantly surprised! The material is a little thinner than I'd like but it's not too see thru. I wear an XL/16 & was worried it wouldn't fit in the chest area but I got an XXL & it's perfect! I'm happy overall!


Comfortable dress and very flattering. I normally wear a 10-12 in dresses or a large. I am 36 DDD so usually have issues with things fitting in the bust area but this fits perfect. I cold washed and line dried it without any concerns. Stitching is intact and the material does not feel cheap. I loved it so much I ordered another dress from this company and love it, as well. This is a great buy for quality, fast shipment, and price.


I have 3 of these style dresses. Iâ€™m 5â€™8 185 lbs. The xl fit great, however I bought this one as what I thought would be a replacement for the one that shrank a little after washing and hang drying. It was way shorter then the one that shrank. I like my maxi dresses to touch the ground, not the top of my ankle. The length of theses dresses are all over the place. Had to send this one back.


This thing looks like what my third grade, overweight teacher wore. It is not sexy or even youthful at all. I returned it. It is soft and long though, so maybe another color would be better.


Love this dress,but it has spots on it,12 or 13. Looks like oil or something. Has so many I cannot wear it. Got it to wear at a wedding and it would have been perfectğŸ˜¥


Really pretty dress. It looks just like the picture and it's very flowy! The sleeves are a little tight, so I wish I had ordered a size up, but otherwise, it's great!


I love the color and how flowy this dress is but I really wished I would have gotten an xs instead of the small. I think I might return it to get an xs. It is big on me so it just kind of hangs off of me. I am 5'2, 112lbs, 30B bra, small shirts and size 3 jeans for reference.


This dress is superb it fits and looks amazing and this is super comfortable very happy ğŸ˜Š
