Just like the picture n size is just perfect!


Love love love this dress!!!!


I love it but had to return didn't have my size in that style and color


Wore this to an outdoor summer wedding and was so comfortable.


Dress fit as expected. It is very thin.


Beatiful dress. I bought one size up, as recommended by other reviewers. It is a little loose, but I like it like that. I'd like to buy another color.


very pretty summer floral with extremely full skirt.ideal for summer garden parties.


Super cute! Canâ€™t wait to wear it!


This dress was not made well. Both the material and the construct itself are cheap will not buy again


ordered a small first based on size chart and it was too small, plus it had a rip in the thin fabric.  Ordered a medium and its perfect with no flaws. Love it- just as pictured! gorgeous dress!
