Nice summer dress. Wife thinks it a perfect fit. It's roomy but it's very long, a taller person will appreciate the length. Wife is 5'3", 198lbs, 38C, I purchased a XL. Fits her great, just a bit too long, she'll need to either hem it or wear heels, maybe 2-3" heels. My only disappointment is the color, in the picture the color is vibrant, in reality the color bland.


Milumia has a customer for life!!! I get so many compliments throughout the day that I feel like a celebrity!!!


It is smaller than too small, very inaccurate sizing.  I decided to re-gift it rather than return it, You have to have a super skinny waist in order for you to wiggle into this dress


Beautiful dress! but it runs small. I bought 2 sizes up mine, and still popping out of my boobs :(


Had to get it tailored, because it is just a gorgeous dress!


Attractive dress although thinner than I thought. Unless your 5'10 very long for short ladies. Bright and white looks festive but just to hang out not for a formal event.


Great dress for cover up during summer. Very room and fits very nice on all body sizes and types. I ordered a large for a friend that was 4 months pregnant and she loved the dress


I like this dress, but it's kind of shapeless in the waist area.  Unfortunately I'm returning it.


The dress came smelling like ladies perfume and I found 4 pins at the bottoms like someone was going to get it shortened and then changed their mind and returned it.  It was definitely NOT new


Beautiful dress. I got SO many compliments! LOVE LOVE LOVE it! It is OH SO feminine!!!!!!!


Love this dress exactly what I've been looking for. The colors are even more beautiful. I love the way it flows
