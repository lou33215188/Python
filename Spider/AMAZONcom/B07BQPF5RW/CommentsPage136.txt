Nice dress


gorgeous and super adorable.light weight and breathable


These dresses are absolutely beautiful!! They are flowy and fit perfectly!! Iâ€™ve got 2 and will be ordering more!!


Looks beautiful on. The size is nice in the waist, I just have a larger bust and needed a little more space there, so it fits snugly in that area, but that is not the manufacturer's fault. Can't wait to wear it out!


Love this dress used it for my baby shower. It was a huge hit. People are still talking about how gorgeous my dress was.


Needed a couple minor adjustments. But very pretty and flowy!


I love it.  Very pretty and fits as expected.
