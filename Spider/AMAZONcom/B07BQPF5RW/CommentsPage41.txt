So comfortable.  The sizing is unique and based on the size chart I ordered the XXL.  Was worried this would be too big but the fit is great. Flows over the body.  Length is perfect for my 5'7" frame.  I can wear flats or heels.  Those shorter may need to hem the garment.  The hem is a high low that is not too drastic.  Definitely recommend.


I absolutely love it and have received many compliments. Comfortable and cute. I have it in 4 colours :)


I get lots of compliments when I wear this.  Unfortunately, I washed it in the machine on gentle and that was a bit too much for this cheap dress.  There are threads sticking out from every seam now and I feel that another machine washing would completely do it in.  I will be hand washing this only.


One of my all time favorite dresses!!!!!!  I received so many compliments in just one day!  I can't wait to order more.


Beautiful Dress. Just wish the chest area was able to accommodate larger chested women. I bought a large that fit my body all except for the bust area. My 38 DDD DID NOT fit at all. Disappointed. There's no room to adjust or stretch. The buttons just don't fit across the chest.


This has become a go-to dress, especially for summertime. It's lightweight, a great length, fits well in all the right places and I love the sassy little show of leg since it has an opening. I just bought it in another color. The quality seems good -- I've had it for about a month now and no signs of wear & tear. One thing is that the buttons around the bust stretch apart so you can see cleavage. I've taken to wearing a similarly colored bralet and that fixes the issue just fine. I love also that it's nursing friendly and forgiving in the tummy for new mamas! It's elegant enough for a night out, but casual enough for a day dress.


I'm 5'4', size 12... got a large. Fit perfect,  not too long... colors are as in the picture.. really pretty dress. Wore it for Easter. Got lots of compliments.... if you don't like cleavage showing as I don't,  I wore a white tank under it... I'm a B cup, so if you're bigger it might be too tight... but you could unbutton it w a tank.. the button loops are stretchy so that helps. All in all, great dress...I will consider another one with a different print... it comes in a bag really scrunchy... I hung it up for 2 days & wore it scrunchy... the skirt part is flowy but not too much...


My husband loved it too...ğŸ˜€


The dress fits as expected! Beautiful, flowy, light material, perfect for spring & summer. You'll definitely need to wear a slip under it, as the dress material is very light & see through. I got compliments all day long & people were wanting to know where I purchased it! Happy customer here!


I got the Red_Turquoise. The colors and pattern are beautiful. It is not the best quality there is but then again what can you expect from China? Fits as expected and it is very soft material. I am a size 4 in dresses and I got a S. Make sure you wash & dry it on delicates. It is a bit see through but you really need to look hard.


Would love it and give it 5 stars but there were some draw backs.  First took week to get order and when it arrived it had a sewing flaw.  They missed or forgot one of the buttons and closing loop in bust area, very noticeable, but for me an easy fix verses sending it back and waiting for a new one.  Not sheer.  Love the pattern and the way it falls on my body type.
