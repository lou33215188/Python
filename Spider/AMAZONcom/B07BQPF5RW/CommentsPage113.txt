Love it! Very flatering and confortable. What you see is what you get !


Looks exactly like the picture. I'm 5'4" and 130 pounds bought an S. It is long on me but other than that it fits perfectly. I decided to sew close the skirt because I didn't like the opening. It's a nice dress very versatile you can dress up or down on it.


LOVE this dress!  Wore it today and was complimented so many times.


Best travel dress ever! I am 6'0 bust 34"C, waist 29", hips 42" and a size MEDIUM fits perfect!  Mine did shrink a bit after I washed & machine dried it. The length for me (6ft tall) hits right at the middle of my shin. (4-5 inches below my knee)


Wrinkles a bit, but steams out easily.


Grandma's perfect dress. Completely not form fitting.  All reviews said to order two sizes larger.  I ordered a Medium and Large both were huge.  Terrible


Love it, it's so pretty and feminine looking. I've already ordered another in another color.


This dress is beautiful and comfortable. I get endless compliments every time I wear it. Love it!


So many compliments. Its comfy. Does come wrinkly but I washed it in delicates and threw in dryer for 5 mins and hung dry, next day ready to wear. I m 5' 120lbs didn't have to hem. Got a small. I will be ordering other patterns.


I'm 150 pounds and 5'2 high. considering my high, I always have to get maxi dresses tailored, this is a perfect length maxi dress, the material is very soft, and the color is very pretty, I got it in medium size and it fits perfect my regular size is 8-10, I would definitely recommend this dress!


Beautiful dress! Comfortable, lightweight and fits great
