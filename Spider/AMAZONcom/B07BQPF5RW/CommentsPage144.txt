fits great and looks great - very comfortable


I truly do love this dress. It is beautiful and flowy. Very spring and summer! This dress is meant for a pear shaped woman. I am 5 ft. 7 in. with a 34 B bra size and it fit perfectly in a medium. The length is perfect for flat sandals or small heel shoes. My only complaint would be the buttons running down the front of the dress did not stay put in the button bands therefore, the dress gapped open. I simply sewed the front up - no gaps now. I haven't washed it yet so I do not know if it will hold up for any length of time but it is a beautiful dress. I got the pink.


Beautiful dress


I read the people's reviews, I am a M size in dress but I bought an L size, I shouldn't because it looks a bit loose.


Very  nice, but run small , i got today and I am returning, today.


Gorgeous. But i bought 2 sizes up from normal. Be aware.


comfy and cute


Beautiful! There are a lot of buttons, but I love it. Also, the button holes are made of elastic so watch out that they don't loose their elasticity.


Loved this dress, I’m 5’1” weigh 130lb i bought a small, I thought it was going to be to long but it wasn’t. Material is soooo comfortable, didn’t want to take it off.
