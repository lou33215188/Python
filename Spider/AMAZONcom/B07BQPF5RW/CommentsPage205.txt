This dress is beautiful, nice light weight material.


I loved this dress! so pretty and the material is just light and quality not bad.  I'm an average of size 4 in clothing and dresses, I weigh 123 and I'm 5'4 and ordered a small. It fit just fine, the slit was open slightly hits right above knee. My breasts are small 34b so it sits just a little loose on top but not a problem.  It didn't fit too tight and was comfortable.  I can't wait till I wear it out.  I wish there were more pattern options.  for the price, it's really good!  This type a dress and a short one by Free People was going for $148, I think I win with this one. It makes my shoulders look narrow and I look dainty and feminine.

The sleeves where tight and to short. The fabric was beautiful. I didn't care for the lace up front.
