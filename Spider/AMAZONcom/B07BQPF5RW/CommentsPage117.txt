It was a very cute dress. Just small for my large chest up top. Sad it didn't fit my body type. I am 5'5 125 27 inch waist but double D up top.


I love this dress and I am so glad I found it! Ordered to take with me on a beach vacation. Pleasantly surprised when I put it on and it fit like a glove. Seems like good quality for the price too. Love that it buttons all the way down so you can unbutton to adjust the slit length.


Beautiful dress


I cant believe how awesome this dress is. Super soft. Super comfy. I got tons of compliments the first time I wore it.


So sad that I had to return... beautiful, but too small :(


I am a plus size woman and usually xxl fits me.  This was so small it looked like a s-m size.  Plus then I had to pay to return it, and do all things to make the return. Not worth shopping on line if your sizes are not on some manner telling as to true sizing, pay to ship, pay to return and have nothing but wasted time and energy,


Nice dress for the money.  Order the next size up.  Very comfy and versatile for many occasions.


It's so pretty and flows beatifully. I can't wait to wear it .


Cute and breezy. Got a lot of compliments when I wore it. Only problem I had is that the material wrinkles really easily and it doesn't look as nice after a very short time of wearing it.


Dress is much better than I had expected. Is very pretty and fit perfect. I am 5'6 183 lbs. I bought an XL. My only.complaint is that it's a little too long for me. With heels it doesn't hit the floor but very close. I will probably have two or more inches removed. I am about to buy another one!
