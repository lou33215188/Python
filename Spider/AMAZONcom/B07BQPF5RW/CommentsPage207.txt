I like it so much, I have 3 different colors


Good look


not sized for american women


So cute and comfortable!  I love the flowy shape!


Very comfortable and it gets lots of compliments. Quality is good too.


Like the dress but sizing a little inconsistent.  I got 5, had to send one back too small!!!!  Love the style tho!


A bit long for me. I’m 5’2. But for the price, nice.


VERY VERY LARGE!


Pretty dress! Good value for the price!


In love with this dress. The fabric is so soft and comfortable. Highly recommend this product. One of the best purchase so far.
