I washed it before wearing it and a button came off.


I love this dress. It is so very pretty. The pattern is very delicate. I wish I had paid attention to the fact that it is 100% rayon but nevertheless, I love it. I will have to iron it but it should be no big deal since I really love this dress. The bodice is a big snug but a size larger and it would have been too big and sloppy looking. The buttons are tiny but the hooks are stretchy making the buttons easier to hook. (A crochet hook will help if you have dexterity problems because they are very small.)


Love it! Fits perfect!


Amazing


Somewhat large, but still good ğŸ™ƒ


the sizing of this dress is rediculous...ordered regular size and it was 3-4  INCHES TOO SMALL.


poor quality fabric


It is just right


sent back


I usually wear a Medium but after reading the reviews I ordered a Small and it fits me perfectly. I am 5'3", 130 pounds, 34D cup size, bust 37, waist 30, hips 37 and Small is more than perfect for me. This dress is a dream! Vibrant colors, soft and very good quality fabric, no see through, and very comfortable. This became my favorite dress ever!
