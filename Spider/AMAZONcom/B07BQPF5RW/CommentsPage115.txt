It looks really nice! The buttons are a little annoying though...


I ordered a large after reading some reviews. Size down!! I'm usually a 8-10 and a L was waaay to loose and baggy :(


Way too long in the medium. I'm 5'5" and bottom dragged ground. Had to return.


Gorgeous, but doesn't fit.  I bought what I thought was my size.  Very disappointed.


Love the dress and it fits well. Always receive compliments when I wear it!


too small and made of cheap material.


The dress was tight in the bust and middle. Other than that, it fit well. I am 5'10" and it was just long enough -- a shorter woman would definitely have to shorten it.


finally a beautiful I purchased online that actually fit right.


I'm returning this dress - ordered and XL which usually fits me fairly well and I couldn't even get this on!!


Love this dress. I now have two
