I really love this dress pattern, and ordered in 3 different colors.  It feels so feminine!  I am 5'8" and unfortunately overweight, so I ordered XL.  It is quite snug in the bust, but delightfully comfortable everywhere else.  The sleeves are not tight, the waist is wide and stretchy elastic, the skirt is as full and flowing as anyone could want.  And it gets so many nice compliments!  Just love it!


Gorgeous dress! Amazing price point! I bought it for myself (a large), but I ended up giving it to my daughter because I was too busty for it. (Everywhere else fit well.) It has elastic loops instead of button holes and it pulled a little too much for modesty. I am 5'9", 160 lbs, and wear a 38C. The dress fit my daughter beautifully. She is 5'9", 130 lbs, and wears a 34C.


Everyone that saw it, loved it. I wore it to a wedding.


Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the wrinkling that ironing doesnâ€™t pull out, and what ironing does pull out wrinkles again with any sitting. However, iâ€™ll Be purchasing other colors because itâ€™s comfortable, light, not transparent, soft, and did I mention comfortable? ğŸ˜‚


This dress is better than I could have ever expected! This is the first maxi dress I've owned, so I was really nervous. Despite all of the positive reviews, I was still hesitant to buy online. It is even more gorgeous in person than it looks online! I purchased the light blue color with the reddish flowers and WOW. I have only worn it once but had strangers stopping to ask me where I got it. I am 5'9" with broad shoulders and the Large fit me perfectly. The buttons go down to about my knees, so even in wind the slit wasn't too scandalous, and they stayed buttoned all day. The fabric feels very high quality and it was incredibly comfortable for a hot summer day. I have some weight in the middle that I like to hide, and this dress is perfect for that. Fits tightly in all the right places and loosely in all the right places. I am thinking about buying some in other colors because this is the best dress I own! It's seriously worth the money. Stop hesitating and buy it already!!


I'm 5'4 125 lbs 34/24/37 small frame, fits me perfect and falls right at my feet.  I'll be able to wear sandals or heels. The material has a nice soft flowing weight to it and the colors are very pretty and true to the picture.  I'll be having it cleaned and pressed so I can't comment on how it will wash.  I ordered the same style in Pink as well, it fits and feels the same and it too is very pretty in colors. This summer I have a feeling these will be my go to out and about maxi's.


Am 5.7,165 And 38C.The length of the dress is asymmetrical so the front half comes upto ankle and the back about to the heels.The loops of the button are stretchable.Overall looks a great summer wear.


The dress is beautiful and feels great , but I hung it up to get the  wrinkles out and noticed it already had thread pulling . I hadn't even tried it on yet so that's disappointing. I'm not sure I'll order again


This is a very pretty dress and I received many compliments when I wore it last week.  I am 5" even and weigh about 130lbs.  I normally wear a small but bought the medium since I have pretty wide shoulders.  It is loose around the waist and I probably can take it in a bit.  I had it hemmed 4 inches and it was perfect.  Might buy another one in long sleeve in a small to see if it will fit any better.


I got so many compliments on this dress when I wear it.  The buttons pulled a little in the chest (I have a D size cup).  A few quick stitches with a needle and thread and that problem was solved. At 5'4" the dress was at my ankles and flows so nicely.


Let me start by saying I weigh 170lbs 5'5" tall I bought the xxl and it fits so beautifully that if 6 stars were available I would award them several compliments the most beautiful feminine dressEVER I ordered in every color pleaseeeee offer mor colors love love love this dress
