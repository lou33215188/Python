Beautiful dress . Great fit. Buy it. Makes you want to twirl around.


My only complaints are that it shrinks, even when you hang dry AND the dress was cut unevenly. The right side was longer than the left, which is just sloppy. I do still love the dress though.


I really like this dress. Very pretty and flow, although very tight in the chest


Love this dress. Great quality. I wore it for Easter. So pretty.


I am 5'6" - 157#. LARGE fit perfectly (able to go a few pounds either way really) and flattering. Perhaps a little sheer, but that's white for you.


Poor quality and doubt they would last one wash cycle. Absolutely not worth the pricing but I can certainly see why some love these dresses.


I like this dress so much I'm getting another one in a different pattern.


I love this dress.  I went with my normal size and itfit perfect. I am 5'9" and wesr a size 18 Jean's. I was worried about the length, but it hits right away my ankles.  So comfortable and I and I so many compliments!


I love this dress! Gorgeously light and decently made for the price. I am 5'6, 145, 34-26-40 pear shaped, and the medium fit perfectly, hitting right at the ankle. I purchased the red with white flowers, will probably need a light slip, but other than that, I love it!


Will return it because I'm 5 ft 3 " and  it's way too long. The dress arrived in a plastic bag no tags it looked like a used item extremely wrinkled . Very disappointed.
