Looks cheap, it's hard to iron and the worst it makes me look bigger!!


Oh my good lord.... This dress is beautiful! Extremely flattering, great color pattern and long and flowy! The only thing I really dislike is that it's 100% Rayon. Ugh, why can't we get affordable clothes with better fabrics than rayon??? I'm going to have to iron this puppy every time I want to wear it just because it's rayon. But I'll put up with it cause it's so so flattering! Would totally get 5 stars if the fabric quality was betterz


Perfect. The fabric is very nice. I've had tons of compliments. I am 5'3 and nd 120 lbs and got a small.  it's perfect. I'll buy more


This dress fits well and is very flattering (I am 5'6" and a size 12). However, I bought the red print dress and it was NOT color fast in the wash. The red dye bled all over the dress and over some of my other clothes. I would still recommend this dress, but if you do buy one of the darker patterns, I'd suggest dry-cleaning rather than machine washing.


Excellent dress! I was nervous about buying a dress on-line, especially since most of the time pictures tend to make the product look nicer than in reality. This is not the case for this dress. The dress is very pretty, and perfect for the summer. I wore the dress in Europe and received many compliments from men and women. A must buy!


The quality on this dress is great and the fit was perfect.


This is a gorgeous dress. I ordered it for family pics and will also wear it for Easter. Fits great.


I liked it but unfortunately was too small on top.  If there had been a larger size I probably would've exchanged it instead of returning it.


I'm 5 feet and weigh 135 lbs. size small was somewhat large especially in the shoulders. Extra small would have probably fit better.


I love the dresses, so comfortable. fits like a dream. They do need to be hemmed, not what I expected but I can handle that.
