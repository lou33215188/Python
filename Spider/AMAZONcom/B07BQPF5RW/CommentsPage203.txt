Awesome color and very pretty! Great price too.


This dress is really pretty but it didn't fit. I am 5 ft and about 115 lbs and the small was way too baggy. Next time I'd definitely order a xs!


Wonderfull!!!


A lot of buttons down the front that aren't really necessary. I am tall and it's long. Beautiful fabric. No instructions of how to care for it. Buy every color!!!


Too small, can't wear. Very pretty, colors were like picture.


very pretty summer dress. Got a lot of compliments!


For my first time shopping here, I got exactly what I hoped for... a perfect fit and a beautiful dress.


Dress fit well, but string tassel was unraveling when I opened the package. Have to return.


Perfect length for my 5'3 height & it fits perfectly!


Love this dress. Get so many compliments on it as well.
