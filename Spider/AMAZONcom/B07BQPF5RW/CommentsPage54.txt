I like the dress, but it was damaged. It had some noticeable bad stitching and ripped around the chest area. Iâ€™m going to order it again and hope this one comes in a good condition. Then I will decide how many stars to give. So far is not good and is a shame because the dress is very pretty.


This is the 3rd item I buy from this brand that I absolutely LOVE!!! This dress is beautiful! So light and flowy, perfect fit and very flattering. I did order a size up and now having tried the dress I probably could have gotten away without going up but glad I did for the extra room!


This is one of my favorite things that I have ordered from Amazon. It fits perfectly and looks even better than I expected. It also has real buttons all the way down which is a nice touch. Good fabric, long enough, fits well.


Too large and too long.  I ordered based off the size chart, but you may want to size down; I'm a size 12 (36DD bust and 5'3.5" tall) and ordered the red/white floral dress in an XXL.  It is a nice dress, but I will definitely need to take it in and have it shortened.


I am only giving this dress two stars because the material seems cheap. If you are larger in the chest I would definitely go with at least a medium. The dress would have fit me everywhere else, but I am a 36D and had to return a size small.


Cute but the style was a bit matronly for my liking. I retired it. I'm a true size 6, 34c and ordered a medium and it fit well.


I kind of looked like an old woman in this. :( And at 5'11", it definitely wasn't a maxi. It came to my lower calf. I returned it.


Very happy with the purchase!  The dress is light and very feminine. It fits well and is a great length for me.  I am 5"9" and it is a few inches above the ankle.  It does come very wrinkled but I suppose that is to be expected after shipping.


Perfect summer dress!  Ordered small - 5'7" 130lbs. Love love love! I received so many compliments today;  I decided to write a review.


Quality on this dress seems pretty hit or miss. Ordered the navy in a medium (5'8, 140, b-cup) and it's great! Packs well. The mint colored one I ordered next had a hole ripped in the side seam and the Hem is not symmetrical (longer on one side) worst wrinkling ever.
