This dress is beautiful. I am 160lbs & 5'4. I ordered a size L, I'm glad I did because my arms are pretty big. The middle part of the dress is a bit loose. This dress is a great buy!


Beautiful colors, great price, fits perfectly!


Sizing is way too small.


Love, love, LOVE this dress! Fits true to size and is gorgeous!


The sizing is LAUGHABLE at best. If you have large breasts do not buy this dress. Total fail.


Too old ladish for me. I plan on giving it to someone who will like it.


As perfect a fit is a dress can get beautiful I love it


Color cost canâ€™t go wrong  I get many compliments


Great dress! But it's too long. I'll have to hem it.


Bust and arms were very tight. Pretty though...
