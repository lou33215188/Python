This dress is amazing!! ğŸ™ŒğŸ�½ I wore it to a nice event, my Gran Gran's 80th Birthday party. I bought it in Pink. I usually wear a medium everything and I bought it in a medium (5'4" 145lbs). It fit perfectly. I was worried that it would be too long but it worked really well with my 2 inch heels. I had to hold it while going downstairs, rising from a chair etc but it didn't drag the ground while walking or hover at an awkward length. EVERYONE, literally everyone from my family to the wait staff at the event, was complimenting me and asking me where I got it. I'm considering buying it in other colors for summer. One more note: I am a nursing mother and I primarily found this dress while looking for nursing friendly dresses for this event and with the buttons (which are buttoned into stretchy elastic style loops) I was able to nurse relatively easily (takes a sec to rebutton with a squirmy infant). This dress is a complete win.


Really disappointed in this dress. The print is beautiful, but the quality is appalling especially considering the price. The hem was uneven, threads were all over the place, the buttons were so spread out that if I COULD wear it, I would have to wear a slip just so my underwear wouldn't be seen through the spaces in between the buttons, the seams were already ripping before I even put it on, the chest area was sewn incorrectly which made one side really baggy and the waistline was all crooked. I wanted to love this so much, but no go.


The style matches the photo, but the size is a good 2-3 sized smaller than the size chart. I also received the wrong color, which is a careless mistake that is very frustrating. Not to mention it was just shoved into the bag it shipped it, so it came COMPLETELY wrinkled. Material is thin & the buttons donâ€™t overlap the fabric. To understand why this is such a big deal, thereâ€™s no give in the busy area because youâ€™d have cleavage popping out everywhere.


I hate to give this dress a bad review because I loved the red and white pattern. I had to send it back though. The sleeves stuck up kind of oddly, almost at a point. I was going to have to tack between each button because they do gap. I was willing to do that but considering it needed hemmed (I'm 5'2) and the issue with the sleeves it wasn't worth it. I also considered wearing a cardigan to cover the sleeves but I didn't feel it was worth having it hemmed.


I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this dress based on previous reviews, but was very please when it arrived. all the hems and everything matched up when buttoned, and it fit well too. the fabric is flowy, a bit artificial feeling, but nice none the less. My draw back is that I'm not super chesty so the top button comes mid chest, above my cleavage, and it doesn't fold back well if left unbuttoned a bit, not that I want to necessarily show off my bits, but if I'm feeling flirty, a small peek doesn't hurt. My favorite part of this dress however, is that it just touches the ground in the back, but is ever so slightly hiked in the front so I don't fear stepping on it. I stand at 5' 4"


This dress is just lovely for a Louisiana hs graduation.  It is soft, flowing and so comfy.  I am 5â€™4â€�, 158#, generally a size 12.  I plan to rinse with cold water and air dry , and hopefully it wont shrink too much ( see the warning in the product info).  Yes, it is long and I have to get it hemmed.  Also, it will be perfect for my hot Texas summers.  I question the durability of the fabric, since it seems delicate.  Weâ€™ll see!


Fits well, a tad long if you wear it with flats (I don't wear heels unless absolutely necessary) so I did have to watch it when I was navigating stairs and such. The fabric is very light and comfortable, but still thick enough that I don't have to fear showing the world my undies if I am standing in front of light. I got a lot of compliments on this dress and did go back and purchase another in a different pattern I liked it so much. May even get one or two more since they do have some variety in the patterns and the fit was so comfortable for a good price.


I have this float vintage-inspired sun dress in the Mint Green Floral Print & chose a vender that shipped directly from Amazon.


I went off what another reviewer suggested, to go by the size chart that is with the color you are choosing.  For measurements of 33-25-34, the Medium I ordered fits very well.  Im 5'7 & the length is good in flats, & the buttons go down until around my knees.


I love the color of the dress, the print is as pictured, & the material is soft & smooth.  My only complaint is that it wrinkles so easily.


I like this dress! I was weary because the reviews seemed split but it is a very pretty dress. I followed the reviews and ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it was too big so I washed it on delicate and dried on medium heat and now it fits like a glove! It's very lightweight and will make a perfect summer time dress. I will probably order another one for my maternity photos


Although this dress fit as expected, it arrived 5 days later than specified date! I tracked pkg & it looked like it will be delivered on that specified Saturday, to wear it for my uncle's 93rd B'Day. But, at the last minute, I had to make a trip to the mall and make another purchase. This seller is based in Moreno Valley (warehouse), Southern California. I too reside in So. California. Beware of ordering from this seller, Prime Members. Order in advance is my advice to everyone who love Amazon products! The fabric is not great quality. I washed it in woolite to avoid shrinkage.
