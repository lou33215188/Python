Nothing to say besides "love it"!


I would have given it a higher rating if the sleeves weren't so tight.  Any tighter, and I wouldn't have been able to get my arm in it.  I don't have large arms, but being older, I do have a bit of a bat wing.  I wish the sleeves were slightly larger.


Keeping this one.  Really nice fit and soft material also.


Way to long but otherwise ok.


Sooo many compliments on this dress!


slightly see through but love the dress


Very cute that runs a bit small


Very nice dress runs small


The sleeves are really puffy and not flattering! And it was missing a button right in the middle. I was actually really disappointed in this dress. I had been wanting it for weeks and was let down that the sleeves were so awkward!


Love the pattern, fits a little small. The hem was all different lengths, had to have it altered.


Didn't return it because the price was so good!
