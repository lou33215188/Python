Love the fit, it runs a little large, we aware when you wash it since it realeases a lot of tint and can stain other clothes (the white parts of the dress became color pink after the first wash).


I am 5'4" and 170 - pear shaped/smaller chest and I got a Large in this dress. It fits great! Lots of buttons on it but the waist is stretchy so I just pulled it over my head to put it on. It's super flowy! I love it. It is barely a little see-through so maybe wear a slip if you're real worried about it. I got the blue/green dress.


The dress fits how I thought it would. The material is cool and flowy. It's not thick material but not thin where I have to wear a slip. It's a perfect casual dress to wear with flip flops or some sandals. I will order another color.


Very pretty, but see-through.  I will need to get a slip for this.  Also, the buttons at the chest gape open.


Love it, good fabric, sewing job not the best but still looks nice


Nice dress and print, but it runs very small!


Great fabric but way too small. I normally wear an XL top due to large breasts. This XL didnt come close. The fabric, print and length were great. If it fit, I would have been happy.


I wore this dress on my weekend away to Antique, Guatemala.  I got so many looks and compliments.  I recommend this; it is beautiful and flattering.


It is too long. I don't it is necessary that it drags on the ground when I walk.


The dress and the fabric are beautiful, but definitely you need to wear a slip. I'm 140 lbs and 5'9" and the dress fits perfect but it's too short.
