loved this dress ! bought it for cuba, to wear as a shirt and it did exactly what i wanted it too.


one of the ties fell off prior to me leaving the house but i wasn't wearing the dress buttoned down that far anyway.


GREAT DRESS ! LOVE THE PRINT .


Great fit just waiting for the weather to warm up


This is a great little dress, almost wrinkle free and great for packing.  Looks great on.  But order 1 or 2 sizes up from your normal size.


I love the style of this dress and the length. I would the colours to be a little more muted but is as shown. Very comfortable.


Pretty pattern but as usual with clothes not made in the USA, the fit is poor.


Love this dress. Looks amazing. Great material. Fits perfectly. I'm already  purchasing more.


So wrinkly. Even after ironing, as soon as you sit it's a wrinkled mess. There's so much fabric it drags the ground when you sit, go up stairs, try to get into the car. It'll just be one of those awkward dresses that hangs in the closet, that you occasionaly try on, and then remember: oh yeah, that's why I never wear you.


So comfortable. I love it!


Did not fit the bust. Had to return regular size and reorder 1 size up. Now it's perfect. Love this dress.


I love how it fits. I had to hem it though as it is very long and I am only 5'1". The fabric is soft and flowy and everyone told me I looked great in it.
