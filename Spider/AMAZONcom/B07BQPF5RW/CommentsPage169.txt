There is absolutely no strength to the elastic holding the buttons which is supposed to keep the dress closed.


This was much too large and after reading some of the reviews saying it ran small I ordered a larger size.  Didn't work out for me, unfortunately.


I love the dress I don't like the edged hem. I will have to hem it. Long enough to do this.


I received many compliments on this dress. Overall fit is good the dress is cheaply made hem was not even. I kept it anyway because it's hard to tell it's uneven due to the long length.


It's a beautiful dress, lightweight and flows nicely


This lovely dress is well made, luxurious, and true to size. In fact, it exceeded my expectations.


Perfect fit; light and cool


Love the dress and so does my husband.


I’m 5’10 and about 170 lbs and ordered a large. I liked the vibrant print, definitely would require a slip but I have to return because the shoulders don’t quite fit right.


I ordered a med. and it fit perfect.  Nice material.


Love it.
