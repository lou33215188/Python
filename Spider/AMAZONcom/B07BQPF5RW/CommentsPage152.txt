I have had several compliments on this dress .. I love the pattern and it's very flattering.. I plan on buying more in the other prints


I love this dress! It fits as expected and the material is quality and beautiful. just ordered it again in a darker color for a nice evening out.


Loved the style and fit but the red had run into all the white, almost looked like someone had washed it incorrectly


it's actually much better than i expected! comes as described, fit perfectly, sewn together well, the colors are just as vibrant, and it's not sheer at all


Beautiful dress. Though I need a few alterations on it but overall I like it a lot. If you're 5'3 with 37" bust like me, order size M.


I love it really fun to wear


Love this Dress! ! I ordered it on wear post party’s and have continued to wear it a year later. I’m 5’10” and it hits at the ankle. It’s a light weight material but it’s not see through. Perfect for summer!


pretty but runs 2 sizes to small


I am a 38DD and i ordered a XXl it still was a tiny gappy at the chest.... but otherwise beautiful. Loved it till i washed it....i got the red and white floral. I did exactly like the directions said and it bled :(  i did call and amazon did refund me.


Also wrinkles a lot
