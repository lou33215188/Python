I felt like a peasant in this dress.


Runs really really big. VERY long. I am 5 foot 9 and it hits the floor. Beautiful dress just measure carefully. I should have ordered a medium. Good quality--


Love this dress! It's a great price. I didn't feel like it was too sheer like some other reviews said. I bought an XL and it fit great. I will say if you have a big chest order a size bigger than usual. I'm a 34DD and I am certain had I ordered a large the top would not have fit so well. Great deal!


Dress is very sheer and low quality fabric. Mine came missing a button loop, and the tie was frayed and falling off the dress. I was surprised to see that this got such high reviews. I will be returning mine. ğŸ™�


Pretty, flowy dress.


This is a nice dress! It's light and "summery".


Cheaply made.


This dress is super flattering! I like that you can unbutton to make more sexy, or keep things more modest!  It is like material, so for a long dress it is not too hot.  I wore this to a Luau in HI, and received a lot of compliments!


Love this dress :-) probably order a size up?! I am 5'7 and weigh 160, the large fits great and the length is perfect


It seemed like a decent dress but I couldn't button it! It runs way small (the XL is like M)
