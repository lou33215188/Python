Lovely - just not proportioned for me


A bit tight up top but still works. I'm a 38D and the buttons want to pop out, lol. Very nice dress though.


A lovely dress. Great for a night out.


So beautiful I am a golden Spanish and it looks so exotic


Love this dress ! I was unsure when I bought it but love the way it fits and flows. It is soft, flowy, stretchy and the material is thicker than I expected. The print is livelier than appears in the photos. Am so tempted to get one more in another color..


The dress is cute; however, it is way to expensive for the quality


Second one of these I have purchased - I love them!


I actually had to send this product back. It was a beautiful dress. It just didn't look quite right on my body shape.


Fit perfectly! Just follow the size chart


not crazy about the print
