It's really pretty but it is wayyyy too long for someone like me who is 5'2


I love the style and the colors! Good for lounging around. I had to shorten it for my 5â€™2â€� height!


Very nice dress. I got it for my girl and she loves it,thank you!


I gambled on the size and should have gotten the larger size as sizing suggests. I can still wear it, but no dryer and needs ironed out to make it as large as possible. I love the comfort and look!! Incentive to lose a few more pounds. ğŸ˜‰


Beautiful silk nice


I'm 5'4" 125-130lbs, size small fits tinge bit big and 1 inch touching floor. I would have chosen XS, this is great looking dress. Feminine, sexy yet conservative, all in one. LOVE!


I'm 5'8" and a size 10. This dress fit comfortably, was just a few inches off the floor in flats, was insanely flattering and I got compliments from almost everyone that saw it!!! I'm very temped to order several in different patterns and to hunt down a shorter length.


Gorgeous dress!! However, be careful not to put it in the dryer. It will shrink! I want to buy one in every color!!


Exactly as it looks, flirty dress, fabric is lovely and the fit is really good.


I loved the dress, however it was just way to long for me!  Considering altering, however it wouldn't work due to the style of the dress, cutting it off just wouldn't work!
