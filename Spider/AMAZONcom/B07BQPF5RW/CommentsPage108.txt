The elastic that holds the buttons is already starting to come off, I've worn it twice. Other than that, it's a really cute dress. I love it!


This dress is so beautiful and flowing! Washes and dries, no shrinkage no wrinkles!


Beautiful dress that falls in the most flattering way. I really LOVE the color and the print!!  nbbI ordered the XXL as I usually wear an XL (as suggested by other reviewers). I am a pear, so the bust area is a little large on me. I'm sure if I were bustier, it would have fit perfectly. Despite that, I love the dress and the way it looks on me.


I love this dress! I am 5'7, 195, 14 pants size with a 40C bust and a XXL fit perfectly except for a bit tight in the bust . I got so many compliments the first time I wore it, definitely will be getting more styles!


This looks so pretty on and is good quality for the price.


Fits well but I lil small in the boobs. I love how airy the fabric is and the pattern is very cute.


Really liked the dress. Very comfortable even if a little blousy.


It's a little long for me, but I typically wear a short size (when available). The dress is really pretty.


This dress is comfortable and cute! This can be a casual or a formal dress. LOVE IT!!


What an amazing dress.... It flows with the wind it makes you feel super awesome. IM a 34D and large was more than perfect!...
