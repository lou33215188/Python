It looks really good and fit really well, the only problem is that it's super long (I'm only 5'3 so that's why) but it can be hemmed easily!


The dress fit perfectly.  received several compliments while wearing it.


I love this dress


I bought a size medium, I'm 150 lbs and 5'1" it fits me  as expected, love the fabric it's so fresh good for the summer days.


I love it, gonna wear to my mother's 100th birthday party,  no need to hem and I'm 5'3"


Loved this dress , fits perfectly looked great on . Very flowing


I wish I had gotten XS. I will still wear it. Love it!


I loved the print but it is very small in the shoulders


So much flow and grace. What a lovely dress!
