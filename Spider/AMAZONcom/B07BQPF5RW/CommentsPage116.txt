Fits well and is not too long but long enough. I'm 5'7" 165 pounds and the XL fit me well.


Love this dress! Fits perfectly and looks beautiful. The ties are just for show and they were attached to the inside so I ended up having to cut them off, other than that it's great.


I loved the silhouette of the dress although the elastic button strings left gaping holes ask the way down the dress making it appear as though I was busting out of it though the dress actually fit fine...then by the third day the tie front completely came undone...overall nice dress just cheap materials.


Really pretty (I ordered red) and fits well. The skinny rope belt is unnecessary, but that's okay!


The bust area was somewhat smaller than expected, though the shoulders, arms, skirt, waist, and length are wonderful.  I bought an XL and am a 40D. When I wear a minimizing bra, it's okay.  The buttons are hooked with stretchy loops, so that helps. I love the look and feel of the dress.  The material is lovely and the flowing skirt is fun to wear.


Too tight across the bust, otherwise nice fit.  Beautiful fabric and dress though.


Gorgeous dress; great movement. Everywere I go people ask me where I bought it.


about 2 sizes too small.


Beautiful dress. Print not as vivid as I would like, but it suits me well. Very happy. Usually take a Large, but went with XL. Glad I did.


This dress is great for the price.
