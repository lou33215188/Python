This dress is great but beware it shrinks in length!! I'm 5'2 and it was too long. I washed in cold water and let hang to dry. Now it's perfect!


Love this dress! I usually wear a medium (5'7, 143lbs)----I ordered medium, and it worked great! It was a little loose though and I think I will try a small for my next dress from this company. Fun print, nice design, good price. Would recommend to a friend.


This dress makes me feel like a hippie goddess. Every time I've worn it I've gotten so many compliments.


I love it!!! Itâ€™s super pretty and quality is good.


A bit too big for my small frame; but nice on


Lots of compliments! Beautiful fabric and flattering fit!


Amazing I got so many complements on this dress. The only problem is it got a little wrinkled throughout the day but that's nothing a quick steam or a toss in the dyer wouldn't fix


Runs very small. I would not buy it!!!!!


Loved the dress, but someone got in a hurry while sewing the seams and caught another pert of the dress along with it.  Returned the dress and ordered another one.  This is the fourth color of dress for me.  The rest are completely beautiful!
