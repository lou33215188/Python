Love it! It was my favorite summer dress! I want it in more colors!!


beautiful, received many compliments


Exactly what I needed.


Such good quality. I'm wearing this to a bridal shower, and it is perfect for the occasion. I liked it so much that I already ordered it in another color!


Lovely fit, true to size.  better than I expected


Fits as expected, it's long on me, but I am short! Comfortable fit


The best quality, it is so pretty Iâ€™m feel so happy with my dress thank youuu


I wear a size 6 and ordered a 6/8. The top half of the dress was closer to a size 4, cut very low and the waist was too high!! The bottom of the dress was on the floor. Will NOT be wearing it. Will never order from this seller or brand again.


Tight across chest with elastic bands for button closures.


This product would have been rated higher based on the fit and being comfortable, but because of the fact that the red color was bleeding all over the white color flowers because of how cheaply this dress is made the beautiful dress is ruined and cannot be worn especially not for what it was purchased for
