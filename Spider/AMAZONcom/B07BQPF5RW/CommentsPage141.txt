arms cut tight


Not as dressy as it looks had to send back.


I recommend going up a size, this fabric has no stretch at all. I wear a size 16 dress size and bought XXL. (After buying an XL that was too small in the chest) It needs to fit your bust, if you're bigger definitely go up. Generous fit in the skirt area.


Very cute.


Love this dress, cute and comfy


Love it


Great. Love the material. I usually take a large and had to get an extra large. Fits perfectly.


loved it except too small. about 1 size to small i believe. sad to return.


Georgeous dress I had 4 compliments on it in one day. It has a full skirt which makes the dress flow when walking. Fits perfect. True to size.


Super cute!  Very well made. I get complaints on in all the time. Just might buy another in s different pattern.
