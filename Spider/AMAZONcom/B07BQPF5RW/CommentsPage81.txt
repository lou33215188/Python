Although I am 5'2" and this definitely needed to be shortened, this dress is adorable! And for the money it's a great deal! I'm anxious to order another one.


But I ordered up a size according to all the reviews and it was perfect! Iâ€™m normally a medium and ordered a Large! Plus it shrank some in the dryer!


Absolutely gorgeous!! Fit is perfect. I ordered an XL (normally wear a 14). It is not too see thru at all, the colors are vibrant and it feels great on.


Cute once ironed which took a long time. I usually wear a L and I ended up with a XXL. Has a silly little tie on it that I cut off. It was perfect for a wedding and the price is right.


Looks like a 70s maternity dress on me... comfortable but completely hides your shape. My measurements athletic 5'6" (34"bust, 27"waist, 36 hip) 32D


Cute dress - I'm looking forward to wearing it on my upcoming cruise!


The dress itself is pretty.  Only 3 stars is because the sizing is so off.  The 2xl I ordered would probably fit someone wearing a Medium/Large.


175lbs, 5'10.5, typically wear large. Ordered size large. Fit a little loose and several inches too short. Also moderately see-through in the white color.


Love this dress!! It fits perfectly!


I am 5'7" 135 lbs size 6 clothing. I was worried the buttons might pull in the chest area (36C) but it fits just right! As long as it doesn't shrink!


I really like the dress.  Haven't actually worn it, just tried it on.  I am 5'5" 180lbs and I ordered an XL.  Fit comfortably.
