I'm only 5'2" but I felt like this overwhelmed me. Too much material. Weigh 118 lbs. ordered XS

got a lot of compliment when i wore it!


Perfect fit I love it!! I think I'm going to order another in a different color


Love ❤️ it A little snug right now


I didn't think this dress would be that cute on me. I'm 5'5 and 170 and ordered a large. I got sooooo many compliments. Go with the pink and white one.


terrible fabric cheap is cheap.


lovely dress!


I love this dress


very cheaply made for $32. fit as expected, but looks like an Amish dress on. returned.
