Fits fine everywhere but around the arms (not the shoulders - the arms).  When will manufacturers learn that when they are making clothes for extra-large sizes, our arms are also larger.


Love this dress. It looks very cusual, good for beach, picnic events. Fits like expected - I'm 5.2, 128lb, size M.


It's definitely more orange than red(not necessarily a bad thing but I was surprised) but really comfortable. I'm a size 10-12 and got a L, but it fits just slightly loose. The waist is cinched elastic so that helps the looseness, you could probably go down a size if you want something more fitted. Material is thinner but not cheap or see through. I'm short (5'2") and it doesn't drag on the ground which is nice! Good value for a summer dress.


I love this dress.  I love the fit, the feel, and the flow.  I want to order one in a different color now.  FYI, I ordered a medium, which is my regular size.  I am 5 ft 7, and the dress touches the top of my feet.  I usually have trouble with skirt lengths as my legs are long.


Love the softness of the material.  Fits well and the color looks great on me.  I have a teal cardigan that goes perfectly with it and brings out that color in the dress even more.  Love my new dress!!!


I got a small, which fits well everywhere but length. This dress is super long and will need to be hemmed. But otherwise very cute!


this dress is beautiful. Bought it for my daughter for our trip to Hawaii


Awesome dress!`Lots of compliments! I have wide hips and small waist usually a 16-18 I purchased this in xl.


I really like the dress but unfortunately it bleeds terribly in the wash. And every time I was it, it bleeds more.


fits well, feels good ... long to the floor for a 5'6" size, wearing sandals .. and holding dress up to walk I imagine
