It's a greT long dress that you can dress up or down...


I love it!!!


So comfortable and fits beautifully.


I'm 5'7 144lbs and the small fit perfectly! Definitely needed a slip as it can be a bit see through in the right lighting.


The dress colors bleed out after two washes.


Lots of compliments on this dress. I love the way it fits


I love this dress. It's really nicely made and super comfortable and flattering. I will likely purchase more in different colors.


Very pretty,  made of a light weight material.  Very cool for hot weather.  Fit as expected


Beautiful dress! I am 5'7'' and 170 lbs - and I got the Blue/green dress & it couldn't fit better! It's a lovely floral pattern and a great deal!
