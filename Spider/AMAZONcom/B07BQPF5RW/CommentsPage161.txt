2 seams ripped in the first washing. Cheaply made, poor quality. Waste of money.


I ordered a large and it was too small, I gave it to my niece.


awkward fit


I am very happy with this purchase


This is so beautiful.  Just way to small


Fit nice and material was good - I just ended up not loving the patter when I saw it in person.


Just pulled it out of the package and the ties ripped almost completely off.


Looks nothing like picture, feels so cheap


So pretty! Looks more expensive than it is


love it. well made
