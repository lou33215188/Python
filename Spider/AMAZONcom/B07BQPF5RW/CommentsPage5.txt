This dress is soooo cute! Mine is in perfect condition, it looks exactly like the photo/model, and the size I selected fits just right! I am usually a Large, but got an XL after reading reviews saying it was a bit small for several buyers. It fits perfectly! The elastic bunching in the waist is forgiving, so I'm sure a Large would've worked, too, but the XL is just great. I love the pattern (I selected the orange print design), it looks like a sweet, summery southern-country patchwork dress. It reminds me of the dresses my grandma used to make me back home in Kentucky! :') It has 22 buttons that are clasped with elastic loops, not actual button holes, and two long orange strings to tie or leave hanging (I 'attempted' to show these in the photos! Haha!) I love it, I want one in every color, and I'd certainly recommend it to a friend.


The dress came in on time. Yay! I wore it to a friend's wedding and got many compliments. It's gorgeous because it's so flowy and so comfortable (esp if you like to eat a lot...if you know what i mean..lol) the reason I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of 2 things:


1. When the package arrived, I opened it and the dress was damp and smelled really...funny. That was really weird to me.


2. The print isn't EXACTLY like how it shows..the actual one is a lot more...bold and more blues.


Product update:I originally wrote how much I loved this dress. Since my original review, I must retract all the stars. While I loved the dresses (I have 3 in different patterns) when I first bought them, they are now unwearable. After washing, they shrank at least 3 inches in length. I washed in cold water on Delicate cycle and did not put in the dryer. The red and white pattern, which was my favorite, had color bleed so bad that even if it had not shrank, I would not be able to wear it. Unfortunately, my return window has passed since I purchased these in April and now I am stuck with 3 new dresses that I can't wear.


I have this dress in 3 patterns. I love the way it fits and I get lots of compliments each time I wear one of them. It's comfortable and has a flowing feel. I think it would be complimentary to most body types. I'm 5'6" and about 135 lbs.  the medium fits perfectly. It just hits the top of my feet, so if you're taller, it may not be long enough if you're looking for a true maxi dress.  As much as I love these dresses, I can't give 5 stars due to some of the workmanship- it has a raw hem and on one dress, the sleeves were a little uneven.


This was the perfect dress for my Engagement party, I LOVED it and it fit me nicely. I also got so many compliments!


With FREE returns and super fast shipping, I LOVE buying from this supplier!

Waist: 27

According to the size chart, I am a size Large - HOWEVER, I looked like a child wearing her mom's dress when I tried the Large...and I'm a Tall size.  I think the flowy fabric, elastic waist and the casual "loose" style of the dress is what does it.


I exchanged it for a Medium and WOW, so much better!  The waist-line is a bit high for me, but that's the fault of being a Tall size and not a Regular.


LOVE this dress!


I am so in love! This dress is so beautiful in person! I got a small, I am 5'2" and 120 lbs. it fits perfectly! I plan on wearing this to a bridal shower. Will definitely be ordering more colors!!ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


This dress fits amazing. I'm 180lb, 5'5 and ordered a Large. I am in love with it. It's so comfy and flowy. Perfect for super hot summer days. I bought 2 of these :)


I'm 5.7", 140lbs, slightly curvy, 34C. The dress came in folded in a zipped plastic on a timely manner. The dress was a bit loose on the shoulders and waist, but alterations fixed it. The dress was very feminine, elegant, and flowy. I got mine in red, and am thinking about getting the white one.


AMAZON: PLEASE LET US LEAVE FEEDBACK FOR ***EACH ITEM*** THAT WE BUY.  This may be a single listing, but since it has multiple different items, they are not all the same.  Example: one dress fits completely different from another and they're both marked as the same size.  The dress colors and patterns are different and that's another thing to critique separately.  It's like trying to describe apples and oranges as a single fruit.


Edited June 12:  The Black_green dress (#2 across in the top row) fits much smaller than the Pink short sleeved (#5 top row) and both are XXL.  The Black-green dress is unwearable due to tightness in bodice and sleeves whereas the Pink dress has a little room for me to grow into, not that I want to - yikes!


The sleeves on the Black_green dress are tight all the way down the sleeve and the armhole itself is smaller than the Pink.


SHOCKING! It FITS!  I say shocking, because off-shore garments traditionally runs much smaller. I bought XXL and it honestly fits fine - even the armholes are large enough to not cut off circulation either at the body or the sleeve bottom. Excellent!  Info: I'm 5' 6" tall, 220 lbs.  The XXL fits just fine and it buttons all the way with enough room to spare so that I don't look like a stuffed sausage.


The stretchy waistband hits around my 40" ribcage, immediately below my breasts (when wearing a bra, lol) and several inches above my waist and is quite comfortable! The dress is very flattering on me if you don't look at my bingo-wings from the rear. I LOVE this dress. Another brilliant design aspect to this dress is that there is a little flange or placket on the inside of the dress down the front so that if the dress is a little too snug and pulls apart at the elastic button bands (hate that), the gap will have that flange of fabric behind it!


It's pretty, I like the fabric, it's light enough for hot weather, but with enough weight and volume to be flowy.  The dress is well-constructed except for the cotton string belt - really very odd - it seems to be regular string off a spool with a string tassel on the ends. Completely unsuitable and impractical for washing, but it's sewn into the garment. I'll be removing that ASAP. I don't see a need for it anyway, it seems to be purely decorative, but in the wrong way - if it was a color that matched any color in the dress it might work, but as it is, it just looks and feels like string.  I might try painting it to match one of the colors  :D  I had also bought another one in Black with elbow length sleeves but that won't arrive until June.  I actually prefer the longer sleeve.


This sleeve (ironed and measured flat) is 10" opening at body (20" circumference) and 8" across bottom of sleeve (16" circumference)


I got a medium and that is my usual size. I wore this dress to a Tuscan themed bridal shower. I love it. It was cute, had a lot of flow for a cheaper dress. It buttons all the way down so no quick zipping. That wasn't an issue for me. There are also 2 strings with tassels on them sewn to the inside. I am not sure why. They are not sewn to match up to the waist so it's noting you pull through and tie. I plan to cut them off and sew them how I want. So that wasn't an issue for me. The color and pattern is gorgeous. It's modest but not ugly. This was great for me since I was going to be around a lot of famil members of the bride and groom. It was comfortable. I would definitely order it again.
