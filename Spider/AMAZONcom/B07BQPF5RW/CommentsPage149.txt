Great dress for hot summer days . Fits nicely, very silky and light weight. I just love it ğŸ˜�


Great looking dress, very comfortable


CUTEST DRESS I OWN!!! SO flattering & I get so many compliments. Literally my favorite dress


LOVE


Great dress for the warmer months. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the buttons on the front do not close the dress all the way. I will need to wear a slip under the dress.


Love this dress.  Exactly what i wanted.  Cool and,comfortable and not too long for this 5' 3" woman.  So pretty i got compliments all day.


Meh. Got a small but a bit shapeless/too big still. Looks a bit cheap as well and felt like I was wearing a tablecloth. Probably better for a taller person.


I am a big chest didn't like the way it fit. The dress was beautiful but unfortunately it just didn't work for me.


beautifl dress ,


Not well made, hem was extremely uneven,  had to cut off up to six inches on one side to fix. I bought this for casual summer wear, but way too much "flowy" to it, so now just a waste of money
