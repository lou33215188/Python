i liked it just was sized smaller than stated


This dress is beautiful! I love the light green colored dress. Fits me prefect even though I'm on the heavier size as well as short.


The dress itself is beautiful, but definitely needs a slip underneath it. The entire dress is button-up and there is nothing that blocks a view of everything underneath the dress.


I Love the way the dress looks but you need to buy a larger size than you normally would. About 2 sizes bigger.


If it had pockets  it'd be perfect.


Very happy with fit and fabric.


The dress was as it appeared online, I am a shorty; I think it is for a taller woman. It fit, but it was way to long.


My mom loves it! She says she feels like a Greek princess when she wears it! Nice light and soft fabric also!


I'm 5'3"", I just need to hem it a couple of inches. It should be perfect for my vacation to Mexico next month


IF there were six stars, I'd give this dress all six.  LOVE IT.
