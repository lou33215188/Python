I purchased this dress on my husband's acct. I love the dress; it is "flowey", light and comfortable. Let me pass along some info that would assist you in your purchase decision. I'm 5-4, 135lbs, 34B and 32in waist. No need to size up as this dress has an elastic waistband. If you have a slighter larger top than me, you may still fit in a small. As you can see from my pics, I am wearing flats and the dress hits the floor; I wore the dress with booties (short boots) to work and still had length but did not hit the floor; it kinda sorta brushed it.


It's insane how many compliments I've gotten on this dress. It's so beautiful and flowy. It has so much movement and just flows out behind you as you walk. Looks so striking. I've never been complimented so often on an item of clothing. My one complaint is that it is constructed pretty cheaply. The seams started coming apart after a couple of months, and it's now completely unwearable. I may just have to buy another one though, because it is such a beautiful dress.


I wanted to rate this dress 5 when I wore it first time but yesterday I washed it in a gentle cycle and it scrunk and now it looks funny and short on me and the breast area so tight ....very disappointed because I really loved it and I wanted to buy more colors ğŸ˜£


this dress is beautiful and flowy.  It was a bit tight over my chest (i'm 5*8 and 135lbs with 34DD chest) so the buttons were not staying closed properly.  However i just sewed the two sides together and you can never tell the difference.  It's light and airy and just beautiful


I had a very difficult time trying to figure out what size to buy, and I went on what the reviews that said, getting a medium, knowing I'm a medium in most clothing, and this is fairly large.  I'm hoping that it shrinks up because it is very beautiful, but it is definitely at least one size larger than most clothing you would wear. I should have bought a small, but I'm just hoping it'll shrink. It is very light and easily wrinkled so I recommend treating it with care because where the buttons go up-and-down, you can get wrinkled and look frumpy


I was worried about buying this dress due to mixed reviews but I'm so glad I did. I am 5'7" 178lbs (9 weeks postpartum) with a 41" bust, 35" waist and 45" hips. I bought the XL. I was concerned about it fitting in the chest because people said not to buy if you have big boobs. I am 38 DD. It fits fine but does have a bit of a gap if you move around a bunch. But there is fabric underneath to cover the small gap so I safety pinned it and it works just fine with wiggle room. You could also easily wear a Cami underneath and it would work as well. It is very stretchy in the waist but I have not washed it yet so I'm glad I got the bigger size in case it shrinks. I'm considering buying another one.


I am only 5'2 so the dress is long on me but I wear 6 inch heels daily so it fits fine as long as I wear heels. I am normally a medium but after reading the reviews I went up two sizes and it fits just great. I am a 38DD and have large arms and the XL dress fits me just fine. The dress had a strange odor when I took it out of the bag  so I think you should hand wash it before you wear it. It is really light weight but not see through but just to be on the safe side I will only wear dark undergarments underneath.


really pretty.. I ordered up a size due to product reviews but I think I could have gotten a large. I purchased an XL because I am busty, but there was plenty of room where I think a large would have been fine.. For reference I am 5'5, 180 pounds, 36DD and normally wear a 10/12.  It is very pretty, and irons nicely. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I am not crazy about the loop enclosures on the buttons.. I would prefer normal button holes, but overall, it is very pretty.


The concept of the dress is lovely however the the dress itself as pictured is slightly misleading. The loops for the buttons are elastic, therefore it pulls apart at the bust leaving gaps. If you are bigger in the bust area then go a size up. Wearing a camisole or even a bandeau may not resolve it since the dress is fitted on the top, this may produce a bulky effect because of this i didnt get much use of the dress. The length is good, almost touches the floor but should be fine with even the most modest of heels.


Ok so I ordered this dress with the red print. When I tried it on my mom joked that I looked â€œlittle house on the prairie-esqueâ€� that comment hurt because I felt the dress was more like â€œaloha-esqueâ€� Iâ€™m 5â€™7 and the length is about right, I donâ€™t think I could wear it with heels though. The BIG DOWNSIDE which is hard to tell in the pictures is that the middle is almost ribbed? Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s the right way to describe it. But itâ€™s very noticeable and vey highschool like. Iâ€™m halfway between making this work for a summer barbecue or going through the hassle of returning it. Print is VERY busy for the red color
