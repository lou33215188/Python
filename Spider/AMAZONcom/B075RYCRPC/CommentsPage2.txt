You pull it on over the head and it has a detached belt (it does not wrap around the body). Still nice. Material ok. Good stretch. Not see through. Form fitting so you may need shape wear underneath.


I'm 6'1"tall & weigh 209 lbs. I ordered the XL. Perfect fit! I wanted you all to see where it stops on me. It could've been a tad longer being that I'm over 6 feet tall but I'm totally fine with it. The dress has enough stretch that I stepped into it & didn't have to pull it over my head. So comfortable & breathable. I may order another color. Shipping was FAST. Ordered on a Saturday evening & it arrived Monday mid day USPS.


I generally don't buy clothes on Amazon because I love going into stores and trying them on. I also have a few favorites and I know my size so then I'll order online. However, I was looking for a few inexpensive dresses for the summer and happened upon this one. I was a little skeptical because of the price but decided to give it a try. BTW I'm 5'10, 38D, 31w and went with the XL - (size 10). I didn't want anything too body hugging and this was awesome. The fit was great and I can't begin to say how many compliments I got on it. I plan on getting a few more of these in different colors because I LOVE them. If you're on the fence, don't be. Get it!


Absolutely LOVE this dress! It was the perfect shade of emerald, a bit shiny and on the long side like most of the reviews said it was but was perfect for me at 6 months pregnant and I know it will fit great after the baby. I got a ton of compliments on it at my hubby's work party. Definitely flattering on a curvy or pregnant girl! ğŸ˜Š


I love this dress I got so many compliments.  Okay so I  order a XLarge I normally wear size 14/16 women which is a 1X . I have huge hips & butt.


My wife ordered meduim in this beautiful dress,she is 5'2 height and 120lbs,she's happy to have this dress,its a little long for her but it will be fine if dhe wears high heels ,the material is not cheap,she loves the dress and probably ordering some other color, rated 5 star because its beautiful dress for an affortable price


Other reviews said that it runs small. Ordered an XL for boho fit. The size chart said XL was 16/18. There is no brand or size label on the dress. The sticker on the outside of the bag says XL (US 10). Grrrrrrrr. Quality control Amazon. Come on! Oh... and it is cometely see through.


Love it! It is long, and a bit clingy, and has a mermaid style bottom. I am 5â€™7â€� and about 150 pounds, and I ordered a large. I couldâ€™ve gotten into a medium but it wouldâ€™ve been too clingy for my taste. I would say order up unless you have a perfect figure and like things to cling.


It's not my first time purchasing clothing on Amazon... but what a disappointment with this one... this dress is absolutely horrible. The fit is way too small for a xlarge...  one side of the dress is longer than the other also  the sleeves. Totally a waste of money... definitely going in the trash....


So happy with this dress. I'm postpartum and carrying extra baby weight, so finding a dress that fit comfortably and looked elegant was a challenge. On top of that I'm breastfeeding so I needed to keep the ladies accessible. I got a large and it was perfect. It's a little see through so I wore a slip. Otherwise no adjustments.
