This dress is very beautiful. The material is comfortable. I will purchase another color.


Is not long enough


Husband loved this dress...worse with nice high flip flops.


SUPER flimsy, see-through fabric, especially on the top.  Understand now why the price was so low.


Love the color and the material


Nice


Love it. Hugs your body. I'm 5'7  and it just right length.

Love it


I love this dress... you can dress it up or down, it  has a great strech but still form fitting. I order a Large based on the reviews and it fits like a glove  im a 36 DD and 150 lbs and give wode hips and a small waist this dress accentuates all my "curves".
