Great dress plunging v neck line, form fitting and very comfortable


This dress is a perfect fit.  I love it!!!


Very cheap material, see through.


Fits nice. I am 5”7 and it drags on the floor.  Will need tall shoes.  But dress is pretty


A little long for me, but I am 5'3...  Usually I can just wear heels to compensate for the length...but i will having to hem this dress shorter.  Other than that I am happy with the purchase


Perfect fit


This was a little tight and the material was very thin and cheap but I didn’t expect much for the price I paid. I got one wear out of it for a wedding.


I love the way the dress fits. It may be a little low cut for some but with a necklace, it will be perfect!! I can't wait to wear it.


The material is very flimsy, I would be afraid to go near an open flame with it on. Save your money!


My size is Small in US size .... I bought small and too tight for me  :-(


I returned it!
