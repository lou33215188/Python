The dress is a little more fitted in the leg area then the picture depicts (it doesn't flare out as much).


Made well and fits nicely.  Priced well.  Dress is  long, I'm 5'5, it will drag the ground if I tried  to wear with flats.


This dress is very small despite the fact that I ordered a large. I can't fit it at all.


The black top part of the dress smells really bad, I don’t even know how to describe it. After I touched the material my eyes became irritated. The look of the dress is nice, but the material needs to be better.


Loved it but it was to long and I’m 5”2


I'm in love and will get all colors. I'm 5'11 I got a medium and it comes to my ankles. My first real maxi dress !!!


I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! HEADING OVER TO BUY MORE...


I read order a size up and was not the case.  Order your size if you want this to form to you.


Was Narcissa for Halloween, perfect dress for the costume!


I love it
