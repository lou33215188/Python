I am in love with color. The dress so soft on body and fits good. I like the flare below the knee I will order with different styles.


I'm curvy and it looks GREAT on me! It's hard to find dresses with the right fit, but this is awesome!


I was worried about the size, but when I got it... I Love the dress. Really looks wonderful on! Must but.


A little smaller than expected but still tailors nicely to my figure!


Looks amazing... a bit clingy though


Beautiful dress! My hubby loves it on me!


I am short i should have known it would be too long but i have worn it


Wasn't sure how it was going to fit or look but it fit as expected and it looks like the picture shown


This dress is more like spandex, so it doesn't really have the exact flow that I thought it would have. I still like the dress, however I wish it had less of a spandex feel to it.


I love all of my items, highly recommend all items to others
