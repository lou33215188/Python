This dress is very sheer! A slip will be seen and panty lines will be highly visible.


I like the style, the material but its a bit smaller than expected. Perhaps because its a tighter fit why the material is see-through. For the right fit, I think the dress would be amazing.


It runs small otherwise it a cute dress


I ordered a Medium, I'm 160 lb, 5'6". It was a little short. Ideal for someone who is much shorter than me.


Thanks


I wore this dress for my birthday and i got alot of compliments. I love it thanks Amazon


I love how it fit.... I also bought the white and black one....


Very nice just wasn't very flattering on me.


just as advertised!!


I think this is more of a body contouring dress then the picture shows.
