It was a little snug, but I like the design of it.


Very form fitting.


LOVE THIS! Somewhat fitted, but not snug. VERY flattering on my curves and makes me feel pretty.


Itâ€™s okay. A bit too tight but okay


Love the Dress. So much so that i purchased another one in a different color.


I'm 5'4" and 193 lbs. I bought the xtra large and it fits perfect!


I plan on buying two more in different colors!


Very nice , just too long but can't complain I'm 5"3 , but the rest is  perfect  tk you .


Based on the reviews I got a large. It fit perfectly and is appropriate for casual to dressy affairs... HOWEVER, my dress showed up smelling like smoke and I had to wash it to get that out before I could even try it on or hang it in my closet... Otherwise, a GREAT dress for a great price... I ordered 2 more!!!


Fit's perfectly and is nice.


A bit too small and material too thin for me. However very pretty color and the style is great for any occasion.


Nice dress fits great
