Love this dress. Great material. It is thicker than I thought it was. Only thing, at least with me, the material really shows of lumps and bumps. But it's nothing spanks or slip shorts can't fix.


This would be cute for a reallllly skinny girl. It hugs in the right places it's just that the material is thin so if you have any cellulite like under your butt it will show.


Ordered this dress because I'm a tall lady.  Once I received the dress I tried it on, but it doesn't even go down to my ankles and it doesn't look right.  You can tell it's too short!  With the description of the dress and the reviews it read that it's "supposed" to be long, but it's not.  I'm 6'0 tall.  Need to see if I can return the dress.


I wear a large and ordered a large. Fit great on top. Very clingy through stomach,hips, and thighs. Super see through. Not sure how you could hide that. A slip would be very obvious.


This is a very beautiful dress. I absolutely love it


Got was perfect. I am a size 12, 36D. My rear is not flat, so I have to big careful with anything clingy. An XL fit modestly however the material is white right on the butt and you can see my panties clear as day. Wish it had a built in liner. Had to return it only for this reason.


I'm 5'2 140lbs and I ordered a small, very form fitting, I ordered in another color as well, definitely recommended. Since, Im short, I did get it hemmed, perfect!


Just sexy, I'm wearing it to a wedding.


The fabric is a bit thinner than I expected. Looks like a underslip/liner fabric. The fabric was obviously dyed. My nails were black after trying on this dress. I would not recommend purchasing the black. the other colours were fine and looked lovely.


So many compliments on this dress!! I bought all the other colors too.
