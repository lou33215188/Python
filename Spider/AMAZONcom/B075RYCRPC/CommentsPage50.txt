Liked the dress, ran a bit small. I wear a 8-10 and had to order XL and it was snug


It fit nice but the boob area was a little big but overall it's really cute and elegant.


Fits great stretchy and length is great


I ordered a small and it was way too big. Also too short in length and the cut in the leg area was unflattering


Very nice fit, material is thin but stretchy. Love it


The color isn't what it shows in  the picture....  it's a lot light than emerald....


Does not fit well, dressed like mermaid.


Material is too thin and see-thru...


Perfect for the price! Nice fit below the waist.


I wear a size smaller than i ordered , and that was perfect!!!
