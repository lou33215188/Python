I absolutely recommend this dress !!!!


love it would like to get more soon


Material is much lighter/transparent than what appears in the pic, will definitely need the appropriate undergarments for this.


Would have liked for it to be a little bigger but i happy with it.


I felt amazing in this dress. We went on a date night and it fit all of my curves. I'm 5'7, a 42G and I weigh about 200 pounds but i felt so sexy in it


Form fitting


Fitted way too small!  Def have to return it!!


I'm typically a size 2 and ordered a small and it runs a little small. Other than that I love the dress, it's form fitting and long.


not well constructed


Not as long as described
