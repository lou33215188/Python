Nice fit for a curvy woman


I bought this in the black and white, it fits perfectly and looks really good on. I also order the yellow, I can't wait till it comes in and I hope they get the red back in in my size because it was sold out.


a little long. Went to be altered and tight in the back


Cool dress, dark green, size 10-12, i ordered large it's correct


I like the dress. The color of the dress is beautiful. However, it ran a little small. I wish I had ordered a size larger. Another dress that may just sit in my closet.


A bit long but fits nicely, the string for the waist could have been a bit wider


Fabric is not the best. Some what sheer. Color is not the same as picture. Not satisfied at all.


I ordered 2 of these dresses in a size small but different  colors.  This one was too big and the belt that comes with it was too small. The other one fits perfectly and the belt was normal length.


If you wear a 16 get an xxl. It runs really small shucks a 3x may be better


Haven't wore it yet but when I do, am sure it would be a show stopper
