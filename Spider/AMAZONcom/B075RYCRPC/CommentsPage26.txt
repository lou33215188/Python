Love the color, light material. More of a fitted dress than flowing.


This is my go to dress! It is comfortable and commands attention when you walk in the room. I fits every curve! I am going to buy this dress in every color pattern.


I'm 5 ft 8 and 123 lbs. The small fits well. A little big under the armpits but not very noticeable. Get a good bra and you will look great.


Love it!


Purchased this dress for my mom, she loves long dresses. I ordered her a size large and it hugged her curves in all the right places...as you can see my father LOOOVEEEDDDD it on her!!!!
