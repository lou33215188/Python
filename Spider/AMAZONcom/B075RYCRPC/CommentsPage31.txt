love it


Love this dress!  The waistband is elastic so fyi.  For refetence I'm 5'8", 140 pounds and got the small.  It is perfect.


Looks identical to the photo, that was a pleasant surprise. The dress was a great fit but at 5’7” it wasn’t floor length like the model and that’s how I would have liked it to fit.


Dress looks great. Can easily dress this up for a classy look. I got a size small but since i'm a tiny human its a tab bit big on me which is fine.


This was a very cheap dress.  The material was flimsy.  I usually don't write reviews, but I had to for this dress.  I am very disappointed.


LARGE IS A SIZE 8 - NOT 12 - THE DRESS IS NICE BUT TOO SMALL.
