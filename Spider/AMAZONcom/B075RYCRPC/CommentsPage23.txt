I returned this.


Beautiful!!!


Love it!


The dress looks very cheap and It shows everything. It’s very thin. And it’s very long I’m 5’2. I guess you get what you pay for. The only positive factor is that it came on time with prime.


The sleeves were off the dress was very tight and not made true to size. The picture isnt accurate. I took it to a dress maker had it cut off at bottom and used that material at the v neck so my youngest daughter could wear it


The pattern on the computer was nice but too busy in person. The fabric is also very thin.


Cute


Nice fit  except the length. I will need to cut and hem so it's 5 inches shorter. Fabric is as expected.


very nice


I bought the dress to wear to church for my birthday.  When i tell you this dress rocked! I received so many compliments!  It fit as expected and me being 6 ft in heels it was long enough.  Going to order a few more in different colors.
