I was not crazy about the dress once it arrived. Looks better on the model than in real life.


The dress is cute and the colors are vibrant but it does run small.  Depending how curvy you are, I'd recommend ordering 1-2 sizes up. Not a bad dress for the price.


It fits well, way too long but cutting it looks okay..


My husband and I like the way this dress looks on me. I threw it on and raced out the door, the first night I wore this dress. However, when I pulled it out again, I noticed writing on it!!! Thatâ€™s not cool!


The fit is a little small but it still looks great on.


This dress is amazing!  Fits great and the material is soft.


DON'T DO IT! This is one of the cheapest looking dresses I've seen in a long time. The material looks and smells of spandex and the pattern looks horrific in person. I wouldn't dare wear this in public. I'm really starting to get sick of all the bait and switching on Amazon. I will be returning promptly.


Looks great on, I haven't had a chance to wear it yet. XL equates to size 10 was correct.  It fits perfectly but the material is thinner than what appeared.


i felt beautiful and sexy! i read the previous reviews which assited me in getting the right fit. classy not trashy. snug in the right places and stretchy.
