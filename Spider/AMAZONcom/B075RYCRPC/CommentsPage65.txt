I got mines as a gift and I can agree the waist is a little high but for my body type it works!!!! its not like a tie dress- it comes with a belt but i like it no matter. Thank you sis for my dress!


Very pretty on cheaply made


Order 2 sizes up!


I love this dress! I am 5'4" and weigh 135#. I wear it to church so I didn't want it to be too clingy so I got a size large. I love how it fits. It's cute and comfortable. I could fit into a medium but it might be too sexy for church. I'm thinking of buying another color in medium for going out with my man. For $15 you should just buy it.


It is pretty, and fits well. I'm very happy with it. Only thing is to hem the length, it's really long.


I wear a Large in most dresses. I bought a XL because of the style. I'm 5"6 162pds. This dress fits nice, not to tight. It does touch the floor. It's not low cut. I like it.


I was a little Skeptical about this dress after reading some of the negative reviews but I trudged ahead! I adore it! I bought a large. I am 53 and weigh 150 pounds.


Cheap material, not the color as shown, way too small


Ordered it to wear on Christmas. Turns out it needed to be signed for so I didnâ€™t receive it until after Christmas. I ordered a size bigger than what I normally am and it is still probably two sizes too small. It does NOT look as good on me as most of the women in other reviews. Extremely disappointed.


Definitely smaller than size. Very disappointing
