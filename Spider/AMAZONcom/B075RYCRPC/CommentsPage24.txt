Pretty dress, but, I had to send it back!


The material is a bit thin and questionable but the dress is pretty. Fits snug to the body like a body on dress, so if you have a bit of a belly like i have, you might want to go up a size.


The size is different from what it seems online. Medium size should fit certain ranges of sizes but it doesn't even fit small sized body.


very nice dress, however, alteration was needed to shorten the hem.


Love love love!!  Very flattering


More form fitting than expected... Great style.


Love this dress!


Nice fit, nice length, vibrant color!


Perfect fit for a small. Wear it with a nice pair of heels.


I was hoping it was a wrap dress but it still fit great and I love it!
