I think it runs a little small. And it’s see through :(


Its cute..but what happen to the belt..did not come with dress


Absolutely love this dress


I'm 5'7 around 140 pounds got a medium and it fit nicely!! Wore it for a costume but it was really great and I got a lot of compliments! It is a bit of a mermaid style so it's tighter around the thighs but that didn't bother me


Fast shipping, great packaging, and exactly as described!!! Love, lots of compliments!!


I love this dress, I'm wearing it today.  It was a little smaller than I thought but it stretches


I didn’t love this. The colors are very bright. Might be better in a solid but still not worth it to me.


This dress fits me perfect....it's long and I'll have to get hemmed but I'm used to doing that with long dresses. I'm 5"3.... I recommend you buy this dress!


Could be a little longer.


Material is too light.
