Material was very cheap and flimsy. If you want to wear one time and discard then this the dress for you.


The material and style were not flattering on my body type


Nice wrap dress....Love the look and fit. I'm ordering more.


It fits nice, but the stretch makes the black look discolored.


I like this dress. And have already gotten a compliment. It does run a tad small as it fits like a second skin. But over all a great dress!


Very nice fit! Looks great and sensual on! I want more like it! Love the price as well!


Love it, fits great!


Omg used it as my baby show dress thanks so much


I love this dress!


The item is not the same as it looks in the picture
