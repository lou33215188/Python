I gave ***** because the dress is simply beautiful! I received so many compliments. when I stated where it came from most shot down the idea but all I did was read reviews and they lead me the right way. I ordered a medium and I am about 5"7 and 165 lbs. Its really fitted on the bottom but was kind of big on the top only because I'm not busty. Seriously thinking of getting the other printed on.


Love love LOVE my dress!!! I normally don't buy clothes that I can't try on but when I saw the reviews of other customers I thought, "let's just give it a try!" I am so glad I did!!! My dress arrived quickly and it fit beautifully!!! I received many many compliments. I'm a bit of a modest gal so I did safety pin the chest area but the original fit was still pretty tasteful with a black Cami underneath. It's a long dress so I did have to wear heels to keep it from dragging on the floor. This dress made me feel both classy & "hot" all at the same time. Life is short, Buy the dress!


This dress fit soo good,It's definately a show stopper.I could not believe how beautiful the dress is and how little it cost.This is my first Amazon review,I'm always browsing through customer pictures and I promised to start leaving reviews.This dress is definately my best Amazon purchase so far,I love it!!.


The bottom is very slim, unlike picture.


I am 5' 4" and 135 lbs.  The large was too small... I should have gone with the XL.  But the fabric was nice.  I gave it to my sister in law, and it is super cute on her.  The dress is darling, the size just runs really small.  I still give it 5 stars, just order 2 sizes up.
