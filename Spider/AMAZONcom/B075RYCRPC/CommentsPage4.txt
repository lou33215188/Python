Dress fit PERFECTLY for a spring night on South Beach Miami. Very stretchy and breathable.


The XL fit somewhat snuggly but it's the largest you have and I love the dress otherwise so I'm holding on to it.


It's more mermaid-y at the bottom, it bells out more than pictured here but then again, it may be because it's fitting tight up top. It's a pretty dress though. Cheap material. Be very careful pulling it over you.


This dress is a damn joke. It is not what's pictured. The dress I received was totally different. The material is a shiny spandex. I hate it!!! ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡I wish I could give it no stars. I'll be returning it


This dress fits perfect..... I am 5'8"  170 pounds......and ordered a size large......It fits just right.......I am going to order the other colors......I am very pleased!!!!


I was a little concerned when I first ordered this dress. Once I received it, it took a couple of weeks before I actually wore it. Once I put it on, I was rather pleased. Definitely will be ordering same style, different color/design dresses!


I LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS.  YOU NEED TO BUY IT.  I'M A LARGE AND I PURCHASED A LARGE.  ğŸ‘�â˜�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


Absolutely beautiful dress amazing shape and color but giving three stars because it didnt come with the belt as described and to me it looks unfinished.  I now have to try to find a belt and pay more money.. or try to figure out how to get them to send me just the belt.  I really wanted it as shown and cant find another sash belt exactly like that one.  Kinda sad.  Dress itself is of such great quality I would give five stars but it not coming complete totally throws me off I need this for an upcoming event.


I wound up returning this because I didn't like the fit. I ordered the XL in green. I usually wear a size 14 pants/dress but I am curvy. I'm also only 5'3 so the length was an issue. It was way too long for me both the hem and the sleeves. Instead of being 3/4 sleeves they were regular sleeves that were awkwardly about an inch short. My biggest issue was that the material was really clingy. I was hoping for a loose flowy fit, which is was not. The waist belt is a separate piece. The color is nice, true to the picture.


This dress is so cute and it fits so well.  It is different but amazing.  For me it is a bit hot for the heat of the summer.  This is more suited for early fall or the spring seasons.  Nonetheless it is a beautiful dress that I receive tons of compliments on.  This dress is not for the faint of heart because you will receive lots of attention while wearing it!!!  Happy shopping... ğŸ˜Š


This dress is falling apart in less than 1 year, and its been only worn 3 times.  Bad stitching was noticeable upon delivery, but decided to keep it not knowing it would turn out as bad as it is now.  Lots of threads are now even more loose and hanging in several sections.  It's disappointing to know that I may not be able to wear this dress for sometime.  As a result of this experience, I no longer will hesitate to return apparel when I realize things are wrong from the beginning.
