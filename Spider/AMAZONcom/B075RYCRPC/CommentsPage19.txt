This dress is what sophistication is made of. I'm love the fit, the length and the material.


too tight


I wanted to love it. But the dress smelled and reeked of smoke.


This dress is pretty but a little more form fitting than I would have preferred. It also is very see through if the fabric is stretched at all. Very thin material. I just wear a black slip with mine.


Love this dress and how it fits!  I gave it 4 stars because I felt it could have been a tad bit longer for taller women. Im about 5'6 and 150 lbs and it almost touch the back of my heels. I'll try to update with a pic while wearing it. Excellent value for the price though.


I’m 5’4, weigh 160, bra size 34C. This dress fits perfectly in a medium. It’s stretches were it needs to. You can wear the belt on the dress or make it a head band.


Nice dress but too short for me at 5'9"


The sizing of this dress was all wrong I hate the material its to thin !!! it would of been a nice dress if the material was thicker


The material is super soft and it is clingy so if you’re not looking for anything form fitting, then I wouldn’t suggest this dress. If you’re short like me, you’ll definitely need heels.


I thought I was receiving a large but it fitted too tight and I didn't even recieve my belt that supposed to have came with it.
