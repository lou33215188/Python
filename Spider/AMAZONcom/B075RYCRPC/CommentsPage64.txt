If you want to show them curves baby this dress is FOR YOU! but if you trying to hide them i suggest you move around! This dress is that sexy but classy IF you buy according to your size! I am a shapely 12 with some curves (I's EATS) and this dress looks so nice on. I have worn it more than once already and each time i change the color accent and each time the dress has made a statement without me having to say a word. It is light weight and fits TRUE TO SIZE! Even after a good wash it still fits perfectly! Worth every single PENNY! It came before the expected date and no smell!


The dress is really cute and would look really good on a woman that's a few dress sizes smaller than me. It's very form fitting, which of course shows off all of the things that I want to hide. I would totally recommend it, if you do not share my same insecurities.


Love this dress I look very grand and I love that it hit the floor and I'm 5'10!!!!!


I felt like a movie star....when I tried this dress on for the very first time. I purchased the black and white dress size small, I'm 5'7 tall, weigh 110 lbs.The length of the dress was "perfect" for wearing stilettos. Well sewn seams and fabric is very soft. I needed a maxi dress for a special event. However afterwards I will shorten to midi knee length making it more practical.The extra fabric will be used for a matching headband with sash allowing a more retro 70's look. For accessories I will be wearing black patent leather 4 inch heel sandals,waist cinch belt, handbag and most important  red lipstick & nails.


I currently weigh 180 and 5'7 and this is extremely flattering! I got a Brazilian but lift and it's all hard to find dresses to compliment me. Highly reccomend


I am totally in love with this dress....get an undergarment to smooth everything out!  It came just in time for my grad photo shoot.


I loved this dress. The fabric isn't at all see through but it is VERY formfitting. I needed shapewear with it for sure. For size reference I'm about 5 foot 6 and 190 pounds, and the XL fit me perfectly.


The dress was  dirty ğŸ˜¡


I'm 5'6 and 136lbs, purchased a size small and it fits perfectly. It gives you an hour glass shape, and is super comfortable! I'm absolutely in love with it!


This dress is HIDEOUS!!!!! Looks nothing like the photo. I couldn't take it off fast enough. Cheap material that looks like a bedspread. Returned immediately.
