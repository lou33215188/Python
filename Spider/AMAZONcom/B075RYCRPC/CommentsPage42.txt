I love this dress fit great  I can't wait to wear it


Wore this as a maternity dress. Absolutely LOVED it... the colors are vibrant, its true to size, cute & comfortable..


The dress was beautiful but it was torn and I ordered it for my birthday dinner today. So disappointed and now I have nothing to wear.


I liked the color but the dress is cheap, see througth. Fabric is terrible.


Color was nice shade of green.  The fabric and fit is such that it shows any and all undergarment lines including spanx type wear.


Material is very cheap , looking and thin..not what i expected, picture shows different


Has a lovely fit to the body! And true to size.


I bought this dress for a Morticia Addams Halloween costume and it is perfect! It is very fitted (but stretchy) and flares out at the knees.


Was not what I expected terrible quality going to return please send me a return label


Beautiful dress but fabric smells and is very light weight silky material.
