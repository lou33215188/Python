cannot believe how small these items are, even though I order a much larger size.....


This dress fits exactly as expected! I love it!


I love the dress a bit fitted for me but i will just have to lose somw pound.  Dont mind material


Fantastic!


Super cute super comedy super buy and great price!!


This is my first time buying on Amazon. I read the reviews, and decided. I received my dress and was blown away. The dress fit prefectly. I am 5,3" 165lbs and brought the XL. It a bit long, will have to wear it with heels.


My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. I'm 5'10, and thought it would cover most of my boots that I wore with it. Material is comfy and would buy again if it could have added 6 more inches on length.


Nice dress


I went by the size chart plus a size up and it was so small it could fit my child ! I am so disappointed! I am not even bothering getting a return itâ€™s not worth the shipping !
