Absolutely LOVE this dress & how it looks on me will be ordering in a different color.


Constantly receive compliments on this dress and the 3 others I have. They fit well and are soft and stretchy.


Way too small had to return.


Great for a spring or summer night out. Did true to size


This dress is very nice. It's fits well, and the material is nice also. I'm pettite 5,2 and wear a size 4, it curves my hips and fits my body nicely. I plan to purchase other colors.


Absolutely love this dress, I am 5 ft 3 in. 110 lbs. I ordered a medium for the length. It fits nice with 3 inch heels.


Great material!!!! Worn to a wedding. Very comfortable. Might want to go up a size.


Love this dress!


the fit was spot on.  however, if you are petite (short), you will need to wear heels or alter the dress as it is very long.


Fits perfect body banging in it would purchase another one
