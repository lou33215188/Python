Top was too big and butt was too tight.  Wish it had more flow because it looks really pretty on the model.


Nice


Rave reviews.. loved the lightness of the material. Tons of compliments wearing it. Ordered a Large I'm 5'5 180 lbs 38-31-42 it fit like a glove!


This dress is BEAUTIFUL! love the fabric and it is very comfortable.


I love it. It's dressy enough for church and romantic enough for date night with the hubby.


This dress is everything.  It fits nice.  Defiantly complements my curves. Husband loved it on me.


Cute dress. I had the bottom cut off to tea-length and used the remnant to make a wider sash.


nice


Looks so cute online, but the waist hit my waist reaaaaally high and made me look....weird.


Nice fabric, comfortable and soft. Its a bit see through, but nothing crazy. I just wish it looked different on me.


LOVE this dress! I'm obsessed with super long maxi dresses...this one is fitted, long and elegant...
