I am a large and ordered a large.


I just got the Navy blue dress today. It seems to be good quality and fits true to size.


Very pretty style.  Material is a bit shiny but the fit is nice.


Received so many compliments.  It is a little see through. I wear a slip under it


The dress was very thin but ok. It was extremely long....and a but smaller than I hoped...


No good to small


Hate that it does not have belt hoops for the belt


I absolutely love this dress! I ordered an XL and I wear a size 16/18.


I love ❤️ it!!


Beautiful dress but large was small for me
