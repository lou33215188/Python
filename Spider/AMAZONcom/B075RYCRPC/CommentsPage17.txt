Fantastic dress cut very well. There was a small dye bleed on the white swirl. Well worth it for the price


Lycra for sure! No tag, but Lycra. Okay but not as breathable or fancy as I was hoping for.


Once again GREAT DRESS.... LOVE IT FITS BETTER THAN GREAT......


Absolutely beautiful and sexy!! Hugs all of your curves and the material is soft and it is not see through! Very comfortable, I  am 5'10" and the dress came all the way down a little past ankles but not dragging the floor.  It was perfect! I got an X-Large. Will be ordering this dress in other colors for sure.


I had read the reviews and looked at the pics so I had an idea of what to expect. The dress was perfect. I also purchased the black and white. Im 5â€™9 and wore 2 inch heels and it barely hit the floor. It was tight but that was expected.


It actually looks nicer in the picture.


I absolutely love this dress it fits perfectly!!! Hugs in all the right places and the length is great for heels. I loved the dress so much that I ordered it in yellow too.


cheap material, very unflattering ..... I would not recommend it at all!


It fits well and I get tons of compliments. I just wish it was a few inches longer.


The fit is fine. The material is stretchy. However the dress was too short. I am 5â€™7â€� and the dress was just above my ankles. It was also not a deep v neck as shown. I was quite covered up despite my full Cs. I am returning it only because of those reasons.
