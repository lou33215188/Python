I am 5'10", size 10/12 and ordered a size Large.  While it appears skin tight, it is actually loose and comfortable fitting.  Not too much cleavage and it moves nicely over my curves.  I do wish it was longer though, it barely hits my ankles.


I'm 5'9 and normally wear a medium but because of my height I purchased a large so the length of the dress can be longer! Fits perfectly. The dress hits right at my feet! I've received a lot of compliments! My new fave dress'


I love this dress! I am 5'2" and weigh 160 pounds, so it is hard for me to find maxi dresses that fit both in length and width. I ordered a large, and it fits fine! If you are taller, it might come up a bit short on you, but for little short fat me, it fits fine!


Love the dress and so did everyone else. Very inexpensive and stylish.


Horrible, what a waste of time and money. It looked like a cheap witches costume, no joke. I really wanted the dress in the picture!


great dress and fits excellent


I received so many compliments on my dress. It hugs my curves in all the right places & my hubby loves it. I'm 5'7 180 lbs & a large fit me great. I got the black & white & it is a bit see thru but not too much.


So beautiful and flattering! the material is soft, stretchy, and super comfy.


Thin materials, fits a little small, size up. Overall i like it but would not buy in light colors unless you plan to wear a slip under it.


Been eye balling this dress for some time now and finally decided to go for it and there's no disappointment here. Thank you for the fast delivery.
