Needs to say order  1 size up.


Extremely thin dress. Please wear some type of under slip. Not a bad dress but it does not flow like the picture. However it's a nice outing maxi dress.


the dress fit perfectly... I got compliments galore


Looked fantastic on her!


I love the dress.. I was skeptical because of a few negative reviews.. But material is soft and stretchy.. Colors are vibrant and it looks really cute on..


The dress looks very nice and is comfortable. However, it's quite tight even though I ordered the correct size for my measurements.


Ran reallt small. I could not return for bigger size or something. Basically told me i was at a lost.


I love this dress so cute


Received my order today and it fits great! I ordered a large and it's long enough also! Im going to order another one in a different color. Love it!


This is so beautiful, I love the colors and the fit. I recommend, this can be a casual wear or for any occasion.
