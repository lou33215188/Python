Beautiful. Perfec.


Don't buy it. Unless you buy XXXXXXLARGE .. also returned and asked for a refund and only got partial refund. Very very very disappointed!


It has a good fit, but it is some hwhat long.


Beautiful dress


Cute dress but very thin fabric.  Keep that in mind when wearing.


Love the dress.  Fit in most areas though Im very small in the bust but it worked out well.  Im 5'7, and wear a size medium to large and ordered a size Large


Slightly see through, fit was nice but when I took the dress off it left a black residue all over my body. I used the dress for halloween so it was okay for its purpose but I would not buy it again.


Fit comfortably and looked great. Would buy again!


The dress fits just as described, I purchased a Large. The fabric is lightweight, I love the dress


Super cute dress! I got so many compliments when I wore this dress! It may run a bit tighter than I expected but I am still very pleased with it! Such a great purchase!
