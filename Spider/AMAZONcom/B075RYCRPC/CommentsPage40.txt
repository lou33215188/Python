Although the dress fits true to size the fabric is very poor and sheer


Poorly made....will never purchase from this company again.


Cheap fabric.

Love this. Brings talk girl I like the length. Can't wait to wear it.


Didnâ€™t hit the floor. Wish it was long and hit the floor. That would have be nice


Very nice sundress! Love it!


I like the dress very much! It fits a little smaller than expected but overall I am happy.  I will definitely buy more like this style.


Very comfortable
