Very nice dress, only problem is the top area was too big. Iâ€™m 128 5â€™4 boobs 32c. Everything fits perfectly but the bust.


Very disappointed that you have no way of knowing if the item will fit and will you be able to return for full refund


One of my favorite maxi dresses


Compliments! Compliments! Very comfortable! I wore it to brunch! I am 5'4" 236lbs and ordered a XL! You won't regret this purchase!


I gave this dress 5 stars because it looks just like the picture and it feels and fits great! I will be buying the other prints


Fits beautiful in my high heels. My nephew says that I look like a zebra. I wish tgey had more choices in color than the ones that they have for selection.


All I can say is PERFECT!!


Great Dress! Could be a but longer but overall nice dress


Yes i turned heads at church...I love this dress!!ğŸ˜‰


ğŸ’¯ Pleased
