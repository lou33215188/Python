I bought the dress for a costume and it fits well. I bought an M. It is light and I would use it for a casual occasion.


This dress looks nothing like the picture.  The material and sticking are poor.


too small


Everybody body frame is different. If you say it fits to the size, your body mass is where it should be. If your body mass is not where it should be go up a size or two. Asian women, Caucasian women, and African American women sizes are different.


It was a pretty dress... runs a little small.


This dress is nothing like it is pictured!  It is cheap and worthless.  It has not tag in it and the color looks gray when you put it on.  Please do not waste your time or money on this item!!!


Love the dress but it runs about a size smaller.


For as expected. Love how long it was. I'm 5'9 and it hit the floor. Which is awesome especially for a Morticia costume.


So glad I ordered . Looks really nice on. Nice Material. I am pregnant and was worried about the fit and look but the material is great and is exactly what I wanted and had in mind. Great price too : )


Very flattering! It is so worth the price. I am 5 4in


125 34DD and the small fit perfectly.
