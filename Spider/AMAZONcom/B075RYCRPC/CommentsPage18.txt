The dress, is so sexy...but the straps are so cheap! I wear a large..and always order bigger.


So be ready with needle and thread with this 1


Too big, sent it back. Quick refund. Might fit a standard American woman better than an Asian woman. Good quality, good design.


Love the dress fits as expected I am a normal 10-12 so I got a large . When I wore it I received tons or compliments. Will be buying in other colors


This dress is adorable but the cute is wrong for those with curves. I was disappointed and returned it.  If it were more flowy in the hip area, I would have been okay.


A little snug but i have lost weight so now it fits perfect.


love love love. Nice quality. I was not disappointed at all.


The yellow and green really looks good on a smaller person anyone from a size 14 it's not a complementary fit


Ugly in person looks like a cheap imitation of the picture.


when i tell you this here dress gave me life fit Perfect, with an added stretch, but not to much. i wears wells. Im 5'1 and 164  short and curvy and busty. i order extra large and fit wll. you can wear out, church, and work.... perfect..... i want them all in every color


Poor quality in material. Very see-through and ill fitting.
