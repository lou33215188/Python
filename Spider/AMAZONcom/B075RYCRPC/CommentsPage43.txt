Good quality, I ordered one size larger b/c I wasn't sure of the fit, and its a nice fit


My hubby thought it was very sexy.  Fit was perfect.


Wish it was a little longer. But nice dress.


Really nice dress! I'm a size 12(L) I ordered the xl. If you want a fitted look, I would order you normal size.


I love the way this dress fit


Fit nicely...cheap material but great for the price!


The material was so nice and it fit perfectly the size was accurate ğŸ‘� I will be dealing with you always thanks


Super cute dress


Not even close to the correct size.


This dress is great the only thing about it is that I'm 5'4 and the dress is way too long so I'll definitely have to have it hemmed
