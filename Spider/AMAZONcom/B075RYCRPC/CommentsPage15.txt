Colour was true to the ad, bit see through, wear a slip, ran a bit small and not a real surplice, but would buy this again  it's a very cute dress for the price.


Fits awesome! Great item


Baaaaby, this dress is everything to me. I'm 198 and I got a xl... There is nothing at all wrong with this dress,but it's perfect. I've gotten so many compliments..will order more colors..


Just a waste of money. I'm 5'9" & ordered a Large. It fits like a SM/Med.  The belt is out of place up near bra line and the fabric looks very cheap.


Sexy, elegant and comfortable.


Way toi small.


I bought 2 of these in different prints...this one is shorter (like I'll have to wear flats vs. heels) and tighter than the other. It's also more low cut. Buy up a size or 2.


Love it


It does need hemming, no problem. Looks great on curvy girls. Can wear to work or to dinner, can be dressed up or down using jewelry or scarf.


This dress is by far the BEST dress I own. It is for more curvy woman with a small waist. This feature is accentuated by the dress. The shoulders fit perfectly!! I am 5'6", 160lbs and ordered the medium. It was a perfect fit. I have a smaller waist and rounder bottom and it just fits awesomely!!! I would order more in other colors.
