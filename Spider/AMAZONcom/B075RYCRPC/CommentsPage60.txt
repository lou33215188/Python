Lovely dress!  I'm confused by the negative reviews.I went up a size and it fits great and very flattering. Love the material and glad its not cotton.


The pattern is pretty but it was somewhat large on the waist and very tight on the hips


It could've been a little less clingy.  The waist was a bit dodgy! It wasn't too bad.

I absolutely love this dress! I ordered the black and white in small and didn't expect it to fit this well since I'm very skinny, but this dress gives me hips and a nice silhouette! I can't wait to order the other colors!


Cheap ass s***! The dress was so small my 4 month old couldn't fit it..IDK wat the hell they called themselves doing..if u got meat on yo bones please don't order this handkerchief they call a dress..the s*** is thin a Kleenex !


Material was some kind of plastic derivative. the black was a soft texture. don't get the black and white one.


They s shirts looks nothing like picture at all. Ughhhh


Nice dress but material looks cheap.


The pattern is pretty but the size i ordered is too small...Its suppose to be an XL which fit 16 to 18, its a LIE, its more like a medium...Very disappointed


I finally received my dress fits great and looks amazing. I love it.
