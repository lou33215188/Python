I bought this dress in 3 colors I love it so much.  I get tons of compliments each time I wear it.  Love how elegant the dress looks and elongates the silhouette of a woman.  Buy it - you won't go wrong.


I love this dress! It fit me perfectly. I purchased an XL. I'm 5'9 and 220 lbs with a muscular build. I wear a size 12/14 in clothing. This dress wasn't too tight on me, it's not thin. The dress is bodycon and form fitting. It's long and goes down to my ankles, but do not drag the ground. It's a must buy for the price.


This dress is even cuter than the picture!


I love my dress. he's beautiful


Cheap costume like silky shiny material not very stretchy and waist line sits way too high if your busty.. I donâ€™t understand the good reviews.. had to return..


The dress is a nice color. The material is thinner than I expected. I will say it feels like one of the dress that will not have you sweating a lot. It will look good on a smaller person.  I should have ordered 2 sizes up.


This is such a beautiful dress with a really good quality. It is a little see thru but not too noticeable. It's very comfortable! I highly recommend it if you have a fit/slim body.


Beautiful sexy perfect for my poison ivy costume!


I bought this dress and at first, I was very disappointed the material looked cheap. But I put it on. Oh how I love this dress. Great find for me. So many compliments.


ok
