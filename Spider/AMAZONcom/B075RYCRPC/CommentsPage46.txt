I love it! I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it fit perfectly.


This dress is well-made and I feel marvelous in it.  I weigh 170lbs and I normally wear a medium or a size 12. I ordered a large.

The dress was nice and arrived on time. However, I was disappointed as it didn't come with the belt so I had to try and match a color to buy a belt.


Too small and very long
