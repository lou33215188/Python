Elegant! Nice for tall girls. Fabric was a little thinner than expected.


Terrible quality. CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP looking!! Should have learned my lesson- ordering off of amazon.


Purchased for my mom. She likes it!


its a long dress, but its ok for the price


Beautiful dress. Everything I was hoping for.


This dress had all mouths dropping to the floor when I walked up in the building I lovedddddd it


Love, Love,Love!!!!!!


It made very long.


It fits awesome. I am 5'4" and 150 and a large was perfect.


Love the print and style but the dress runs long.
