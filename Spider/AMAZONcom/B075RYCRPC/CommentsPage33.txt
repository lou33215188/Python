Soft material and cute design. I’m 5’8” and curvy. I bought an XL but the dress is about 4-5 inches too short. That is my disappointment. I will likely wear this dress to bed. It is comfortable.


Beautiful!


I ordered XL - I'm a solid size 14-16 & it was very snug & form fitting. It hides NOTHING... Sexy & awesome dress but your body needs to be flawless.


I like the colors, but you have to buy 3 sizes more bigger!


I always have a hard time finding maxi dresses that are long enough. I'm 5'7 and my legs are long. I wear a 16 in dresses and the XL fit perfectly. Showcased all my curves. If you're on the fence, buy it.


this dress fit perfect on my daughter!


I'm 5'8" and love that it covers my ankles unlike many other maxi dresses I've come across.


Decent material for the price, lots of compliments, I did go up one size.


Like it so much but size problem


Love this dress, great material. I got a lot of compliments on it.
