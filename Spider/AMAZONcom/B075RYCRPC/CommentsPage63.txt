Love this dress!


Love it! I'm 5-5 135 pounds and I order a small and it fits perfect! Got so many compliments on this dress.


HORRIBLE quality.  I ordered this for mother's day and it was simply terrible quality.  It's made from the stretchy material used for kids superhero costumes.  I do not recommend. Star rating was mandatory, not by choice.


I'm soooo pissed!!!! I have one of each, they were all fine until you wash them. So I ordered instead of large I got an exlarge, well it came in today and it's smaller than the large..... I have now come to the conclusion that they take advantage of us you, get what they give you!!!!! I'm done ordering from China!!!!!


I purchased the colorful print and it fit perfectly!! I received a great amount of compliments and it was very comfortable. I am 5'8 and busty at time, so I chose to purchase a large.. the material slighty snugs your frame in a good way.. I hope this helps.


The dress is beautiful. My only issue is I'm 5'2 and I put on the outfit with 3 inch heels and I will still have to get the bottom taken up some.....


Sexy, long, flattering, so many compliments.


Beautiful Dress, too small for American size. My 22nd purchase was that it would fit better. No way could it be worn. I bought the gift for two,different people. I received a bad report too tight cannot fit.


Cheap quality. Way too long even with high heels. Highly recommend not buying this dress. Panty line can be easily seen. Looks more like a children's costume material.


Stitching of size tag using white thread is so visible. I mean who does that! Very disappointed :(
