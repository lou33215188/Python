I am 5.7, 145 Lbs and this dress fits perfectly.


Looks great on my daughter


Like this dress a lot. I had so many compliments thrown at me when i wore this. Material is a little thin but still not see thru and is a great weight for the summer weather.


Item is nice.


She loves it.


Very cute


Product arrives with only one sleeve sewn. Literally the bottom part of sleeve has no stitching. I'll have to fold up the sleeves. Very very cheap material. But cute cut.


The materials is too thin.  The dress looks cheap.


Somewhat thin but foots as expected. Thank you.


FITS VERY WELL ,
