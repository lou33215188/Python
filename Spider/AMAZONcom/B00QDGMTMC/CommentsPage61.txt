I bought this for a retirement party and was very pleased. The color is very bold and the material is soft.


can't wear it in public but ok for sleeping


Great buy! Ordered sm/med and fits true to size. I ordered the green knee length. Hits right below the knee. I'm 5'3"


Awesome dress at an awesome price. The fabric is nice and comfortable. The dress can be worn to both conservative or dressy events. My husband loved this on me.


very cute - just not flattering for my body type


To thin look cheaply axe returned


Nope. The dress was a little snug. I would have ordered a size up. The material seemed really thin  like if you wash it one time it's over. I returned the dress.


Tom Ware Dresses are great. I have million colors in both the sleeves and the sleeve less. The ones with sleeves are made with a better quality though.


i loved it


Love love love this dress!! Very comfy, soft fabric. It is very fitted and hugs your curves would really like another in a different color! I'm 5'5" tall and 140lbs usually a size Small which is the size I ordered from this site and I can't wait to wear it!
