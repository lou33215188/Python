Beautiful dress and very comfy.  It was a little more snug than I had expected, but the material is stretchy so I was still able to fit it.  Love how the material feels on me!


I love this dress. The fit is somewhat small; I ordered size up as many suggested.


Love this dress! It does show everything. If your more on the plus size, Id say stick with dark colors. I purchased the blk & its perfect! Liked it so much purchased the fushia & i need spanx for sure. Everything lil lump & bump will show along with panty & bra lines. The dress itself is great & inexpensive!!! Worth it!


Size L/xl just skims over my size 0 daughter.  At most it would stretch to a size 6 - stretched.  I will NEVER ORDER THIS BRAND AGAIN!


Nice quality and good fit. I really like this dress and this brand. I will order this brand again in the future.


The dress is not as long as it appears. It is very very tight. And very see through. Definitely not work appropriate, which I bought it for.


Amazing dress! Definitely order 2 sizes up. I am a curvy 6/M and ordered an XL. Fits beautifully. I could have gone down one size for a tighter look but it's perfect. Great quality soft modal jersey. Loved it so much I ordered black and then 2 more colors. Will be ordering more styles and colors of this!


Again, horrible fabric. I can't even believe Amazon would represent such a poor vendor. Another donation to Goodwill.


Will purchase again in a different color. This dress hugs you in all the right areas. If you have a curvy figure you will like this dress. Depending on the brand and material I am between a size 10/12.  I purchased the med/lrg and it fits me perfectly.


I love the way it hugs my body ,that says a lot cause am not a straight dress kinda girl
