Nice dress


Perfect


Fit was good. I probably could of went down a size, but it still looked great


Very comfortable.


Nothing of what it's look like


Fits great so beautiful lovely material.


Very form fitting...hugged my curves, not structured, so wear your spanx or what ever body shaper you have


It was a little bit to tight for being and XL


Love the fabric, very comfy


This color fits perfectly unlike the blue that is ridiculously toooo short...
