I'm so in love with this dress that I'm thinking about ordering it in several other colors. Every time I go out wearing it people always ask me where I ordered it from and I tell them Amazon, you should see the look on their faces lol. You can literally wear this for any and every occasion winter, spring, summer, or fall and that's whats so awesome about it. The material is thick and comfortable which means that the dress itself want to wear out so quickly.
