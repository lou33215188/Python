Soft and stretchy...


I love the size and fit, perfect to dress up or dress down.


This dress is super cute and comfortable. It's a teeny bit see through in certain sunlight/lighting but it's really not too bad. Can be dressed up or down. Absolutely perfect.


The product does fit as expected. The only complaint I have is that the color shown online is not the color you receive. The color you receive is a lighter purple not as bright as the display.


I absolutely love this dress. Ordered one size up and it fits amazingly.


Can't wait I wear it, fits like a glove!

Loves dress


Can be dressed up or dressed down! I love this color.


Didn't like the way it fit. Looked more like a jersey dress. I'm sure it would fit someone else better.
