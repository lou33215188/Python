I'm 160 with big breast 38D, I got a large and fit perfectly. Good thick material


Snug fit, great length, love the color.


Love it


I love this dress! I got it in black and I think that is part of why I find it very flattering. Obviously it is stretchy and clingy however, I just had a baby a couple months ago and I still think it looks good even with a little extra "padding". I will pair this with a blazer and wear it to work.


This is my 3rd dress i ordered from them! I purchased the pink, green and taup color. I love them! Fit is great no complaints!! Im going to order the navy and grey one... or probably all the colors! I love these dresses because you can dress them down with cute sandals and accessories and you can dress it up with a blazer and heels.


I really like this dress. Very comfy. However definitely need a slip as the material is very thin.


Love this dress it fits perfectly


I ordered an XL, I'm a size 12 but it was tiny... very cute, I wish it fit, but alas no chance.  I was very surprised as I thought that would be the right fit - perhaps I got one that was wrongly labeled?  I'll give it to a friend.


I'm in love with this dress. I'm 5'2" 190 pounds and the L-XL fit perfect.


Boring dress, no shape to it and not flattering. Don't waste your money
