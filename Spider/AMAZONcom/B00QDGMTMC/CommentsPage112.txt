doesn't look good on me, but a nice dress!


Really cute


Love this dress! I'm a 00 with a 32D cup. I bought the XS. It hugs tight, but it still covers everything to keep it somewhat conservative. Write below the knee (I'm 5'4"). Excellent for office wear. I will be buying more.


Perfect dress.  Love It.  Ordered a XL and I'm a 12/14 and it fit somewhat loose.  Love this dress!


This was a great purchase good material a little transparent but fits great I put a dress girdle under  and it was nice.. Washed it and the material looks the same as when I purchased it


Nice fit.


I love this dress, sexy and subtle.


very nice fit dress for a curvy lady


I ordered a size medium and it was ridiculously tight. There is no way I would wear it out of the house. I'm 5'10" and 135lbs.


love the color the length is right under the knee very true to color and size the material is amazingâ€‹ and stretchy as well.
