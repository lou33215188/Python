Love it!


Perfect


it was awesome I love it!


Love how it fits


Just right


Cute dress. It's pretty thin, but not see through. The sizes are Asian - which means a small is an extra small in US sizes, a small is a medium, and so forth) - so unless you're small like me (30-24-33), you should order up. I ordered a XS/S and got US size S, Asia size XS dresses.


The dress is cheap and is not flattering at all.


The two phone wallets I purchased did not fit the phones.  The Effel tower one, I am still waiting to receive a return label, and I was given the third degree as to why I wanted to return it for a complete refund.


I was a little skeptical of the fit after reading some of the other reviews of how unforgiving the material might be. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it on. Yes, you can see back bra lines & yes, underwear lines (if you do choose to wear them) but otherwise the material is still forgiving of all other the lumps & bumps. The material probably won't was very well but for the price you can just by a new one!


I'm a curvy 5"6 & thought it XL fit great


Very poor quality, fit material, etc
