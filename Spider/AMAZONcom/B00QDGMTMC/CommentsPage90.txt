Where do I start... I feel in love as soon as I put it on. I love this dress! The length is perfect I'm 5'8 and every dress I own is a lot shorter than I'd prefer but this hits right at the knee with a very flattering fit... I just bought in all colors


I absolutely love this dress...it fit nicely in all the right places.  I will certainly order more!


I gave it 5 stars because it's similar quality to clothes from Agaci and Forever 21 and similar price range.  It fits as expected-large.  It was also very long.  I don't think I will get this tailored but I will throw it in the dryer and see what happens.


Great lil dress a bit clingy but still extremely flattering, soft and comfortable dress.


Love love love!


Was hesitant to purchase clothing off of amazon but needed a dress for a party, was a huge hit fit great and I loved the material


Came with a hole in it


I wore this the very next day that it was delivered. It is very comfortable and soft. It's not to short, but not to long either, which is hard for me to find being that I am so short myself.


This dress is completely see through, and it shows all of the lines underneath your clothes. It's really soft and cute, though. I would recommend if you already have a slip and/or shapeware.


Very soft and comfortable. Recommend ordering up one size.
