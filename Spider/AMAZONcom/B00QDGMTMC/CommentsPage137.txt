Material thinner than I like to wear.


The sizing is very misleading in the description of the dress on the website. The dress appears to be about a size 4-6 rather than 14-16 American size. Once I received the dress, I saw that the tag says it is XL-Asian size, a size I never heard of. For me, it is unwearable.


Not what I expected too small and poor quality


Soft fabric and stretchy. Does tend to show "flab" since it sits snug.


bought it for birthday night which had alot of people than expected and got alot of head turns all night wow what a wonderful dress......


Loved this dress so much that I ordered several colors. Great fit!!!


Got it in pink in a medium n I usually wear smalls or extra small.  I'm 5'7'' 130lbs. The medium wasnt too loose.  The material has a great stretch so I'm sure someone 1.5 times my size could fit it as well.  My best friend got a similar dress from Express and paid way more, yet the dresses were almost identical.  I think you cant go wrong with this dress.


Cheap material but for the price I guess it's worth it. Shows every lump on your body


Love this dress. I have it in blue and pink. The pink is a little thin and you can see through it.


Fits like a glove if you are fit but still have curves! Fabric is a little thin, but will be hreay for summer. Soft t-shirt material.
