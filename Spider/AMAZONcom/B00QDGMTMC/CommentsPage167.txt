Love how it fits


Does not look like picture.  Cheap looking


Great dress and fit


I love that dress


Not what I was looking for. I expected something a little more dressy. The purple isn't as purple as the pic shows either. I like the dress  as a casual piece tho.


Quickly became my favorite go-to LBD. It's not for you if you need Spanx, as it will show.


On me, it looks different than in the picture so I am returning this, but the color is beautiful!


GREAT DRESS!! Fits, wears and washes beautifully!! Love this dress!!


Loved the dress , the material was just as I expected but fitted too closely. In the process of returning to get a bigger size.


I am a plus size and it's made for my body. I'm going to put on body shaper and won't be stopped!
