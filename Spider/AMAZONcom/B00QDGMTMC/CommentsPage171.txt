Probably one of my favorite dresses. it fits me really well and can be worn on any occasion.


Nice fit.


cheap fabric, large, & it hangs funny on my body which is curvy.


Encantada


It is a bodycon so don't expect any room, but it does hug your curves and looks nice with a smooth compression type undergarment.


Very Good dress and quality


I really love this dress. It fits just as expected and the material is like a cotton spandex blend so I don't think the color will fade. I absolutely love it. I bought another in the red.


Material is thin and see through


I love this dress I wear it all the time


I'm in love w/this dress
