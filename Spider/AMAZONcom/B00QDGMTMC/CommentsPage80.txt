Material is pretty much see through, and color does not match was is listed. unhappy with the purchase and will return item.


This is a nice dress, but is very, very tight.  I ordered 2 sizes to large and it was still very tight. It is probably supposed to fit like that but I was really uncomfortable in and returned it.


The material is soft and doesn't feel cheap my son is 19 and said it was dope


I put this on and felt sexy instantly. You can dress it up or down. I bought it to wear to work however the material is too thin for that, imo. But I will rock it any and everywhere else.


love! if you can pull it off, go for it. my daughter looks gorgeous in it! i ordered practically every color for her.


I am very satisfied with this dress! Well made, the fabric is quality, the size and length were perfect. Will be looking to buy more from this vendor.


fit great and is very light weight material so every dimple and bulge will be seen.. Love the length on this.. amazing..


It Really Fit Well! The Material Is Super Stretchy! Stretchy Enough To Fit Over My 9 Month Baby Bump! It Is Also Perfect For Work. It Is Super Breathable Too! Definitely Buying In More Colors!


Thank you I love the dress!


Great quality for such a good price. Super cute under a blazer jacket
