Great Curve hugging dress. fabric is very soft and good quality. im 5'1" and it comes down past my knees, just a bit too long.  im 100 lbs and it clings to the body, get your spanx ready! I got the green color, and its a very nice emerald green.


I have purchased few of Tom's dresses now and they are great to dress up or down.


Definitely purchasing in a different color!! The quality was better than I expected and true to size as well. I'm 5'2", 130 lbs and a medium fit perfectly!


I ordered this in a large,  and it's definitely snug, so leave room


Fits perfect! Had to order a size up cause I'm 6'0 ft tall.. Super sexy. Going to order pink, and red.


I loved this dress! It's a perfect summer casual dress or you could even dress it up for a night out. It isn't business appropriate, fits very snug and hugs all your curves. Material seems high quality and is very soft.


So when I was ordering this dress I was a little nervous about how it was going to fit! I tried it on and it fits perfect! This dress is so soft!


Very cute


I cannot say enough, this is a high quality below knee length , gorgeous and simple dress! I am a size 14 /16 and I purchased the xl and it got beautifully ! I have curves and when I put this thing on with my "True corset" steel boned corset on, POW! It's very stretchy, smooth, excellent fabric! Girls get it now!!!


Fits great and super soft.


Dress is flimsy and thin but very stretchy so if your a large like me I would order a medium
