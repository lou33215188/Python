I accidentally ordered two somehow, but I like this dress enough I will be keeping both! Simple and just what I was looking for. Also, very comfortable and flattering.


I got a small in the blue color and it fits true to size. Stretchy fabric so it gives a enough, but it does ride up a lot when you walk. I will be buying more in other colors.


Fits perfect.


Fit as expected but the material is thin. It definitely shows everything


I'm 5'7 170 36D and the large fit great. The material is good quality and feels good against my skin.


Got this for my niece. Fit perfect. And looked amazing on her.


Beautiful dress it hugs all the right places put a body shaper on and get your compliments for your great buy


Order one size up


I don't like this material. I'm pretty petite but this dress clings in all the wrong ways. Its so thin that you can't really wear anything under it but if you don't everyone is going to see every curve on your body.


The dress is great


Adorable.
