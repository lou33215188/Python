Great material and love how it fits!


Love the color and the material is a little too thin for me.  I'm a size M/10 (US) but I got the L/XL because I like my clothes loose not form fitting.  The L/XL is a little to snug for me.  My husband loves it but I guess it's just me.


I'm a size 16...purchased a XL...fits snug and perfect just as promised.


I am 145lbs, 5.2' tall, broader at the hips..I went for the L/XL option..fit me perfectly, it's a bit snug and hugs all your curves, came below my knees. The color is awesome. I just felt the material could have been a little thicker that's why four stars.


I don't like the quality of the material so I shipped it back.


This dress fits great. True to size. I ordered a Medium and I love it. It's nice and fitted and very form flattering.


It's a nice casual dress. Since I have a bit of a pudge, I wanted it to hide that. It did not! I can say that it's very fitting if you're not 5'9 and 193 pounds. It's worth buying for those whom are secure within themselves.


Fits as expected and it does cling closely to body. Love the color


Somewhat small, can wear.


Absolutely stunning. I'm 5'1 95lbs and I got an xs/s and it fits PERFECT. Equal amounts of comfort and class. You need this dress.
