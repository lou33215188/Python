Love this dress fit in all the right places love the color will be order more......


Too clingy showed up everything a little bit too thin


This dress is perfect you can wear it alone or with a blazer.  Day or night you can't go wrong with this dress.


Color does not match, but still a good product


Overall nice piece, but MUCH more body conscious than anticipated. I definitely won't be able to wear this anywhere but going out during the night.


Cheap fabric. Something you could get at a garage sale


I LOVE IT


Love it fits perfectly and I love the color as well


I'm usually a medium bought an XL and it's still a little snug.


Bought the purple in this dress and loved the fit n material it was thickish so I ordered the coral n teal,while it fits good the material is thinner so I was disappointed with the material thought it would've been like the purple but it wasn't.
