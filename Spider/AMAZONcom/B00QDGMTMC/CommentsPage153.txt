Although I ordered xs it still fit a bit lose. Also the material is very comfortable BUT very see through (you would have to not wear underwear...)


Love this dress! Fit perfectly. Although the color is not what I expected (could be my eyes) the design and length were just as I expected. Will be buying a black one next :)


I love this dress! It makes me want to order it in other colors.


5'4'' 125lbs got a S/XS and fit perfectly. If you're curvier get a size up to avoid being see through. As with any stretchy material if you buy an inappropriate size it will appear see through. Nice, quality material with lots of stretch! Comfy and breathable!


Bought this dress unfortunately, for a funeral and had it shipped overnight.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was AWESOME!  It fit perfectly, and is so comfortable!  I got lots of compliments on it!  It can definitely be dressed up with accessories if needed, and looks great with heels.  The dress comes below the knee and covers the chest to make it very classy.  It fits like a glove and it gives with your curves perfectly!  I got the xs/s and it was a great to to size fit!  I would suggest being careful when you wash it, I wouldn't dry it with anything else, or I would hang dry it....I could see it peeling a little if it was with towels in the dryer.  Great dress, will look for more of them!


Perfect fit... Just wish it was a little longer.


material is a little thin but otherwise really nice dress.


Very nice to the body


The front neckline was cut to low, otherwise it


fit great
