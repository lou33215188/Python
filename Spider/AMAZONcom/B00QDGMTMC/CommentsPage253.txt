Loooooove it! I'm 5'3" and about 145 I got the M/L and it looks great. Dress it up or keep it casual it's so versatile! I also bought it in the green colour


Pleasantly surprised! Lovely dress.


Love it!! Fits as expected... I bought one size up since other reviews stated it was semi-see thru. Looks great ğŸ‘�


Fabulous dress. Think stretchy, smooth material. I'm 5'4 115lbs. I wear petite clothing and ordered an xsmall. This fits tight and smooth on me and leaves no curve, bulge or garment unnoticed. IShipping came quicker than expected. Love it.


This dress is poor quality, it has so much lycra it has a bounce to it like rubber.  You can see every bulge.  I usually wear an 8, but I have full hips and butt  so I ordered a large because I could tell the dress was body conscience and dress clinged to my body.  You definitely need to right undergarments to wear under it or you will see every line.  Color was nice and vibrant, but Returning it.


Beautiful color


It fits well but sort of clings to my underwear. And the grey color was so much lighter than I thought it would be.


Seams off bias and just not as nice as looks in pic.


I loveeeee this dress... Fits perfect!


if you have a little stomach beware. it will show that aside it  looks great with my shape ware. it also is seamless under my midi skirts. so it isn't disappointment
