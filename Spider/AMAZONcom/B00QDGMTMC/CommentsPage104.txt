Love it!


Love this dress! Purchased in black size 2XL, 5'1", 175lbs. Plan to purchase a couple more in different colors.


fits snug. soft material. decent length. I am pleased with my purchase.


This dress looked great on me. Fit me as expected. It is a little sheer so I had to wear a solid black bra under it.  My printed colored bra showed through.


Love love love. I have a total of 4 of  these dresses now and they fit true to size. I am a size 8 in jeans and I get a medium/large. They do hug every curve but that's with most bodycons.


Good material. not to thin


Its a little thin.


Dress is exactly as described. I am in love with the color and style! Will defiantly order again in different colors.


I buy a lot of dresses for work and I like to wear them with a blazer. I don't mind a tight fit but the problem with this dress is that the material is very thin so it looks kind of cheap. I'm not sure I'll wear it to work..maybe to an evening cocktail type of event.


For some reason I expexted the color to be more "dark aqua" color but what I got is an emerald color dress..which is fine with me because I don't mind emerald but for some people it might be a deal breaker. Because the material is thin and most likely not the best quality, I wonder how many washes it can go through before starting to show signs of wear. Price is great so I'll keep it and wear it but most likely won't order again.


The dress size was way too small. It looked and fits like a child size large rather than an adult size large. The size chart is not correct with this dress.
