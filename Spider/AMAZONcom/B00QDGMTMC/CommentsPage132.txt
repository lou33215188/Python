Dress is perfection. Beautifully soft,  well made and looks great on.


Nice dress but I would go up 2 sizes... Because it fits like skin....so it will show EVERYTHING


Super thin and poor quality. I sent it back


Fits beautifully and the color is darling! If you are a 2/4 size Small should fit you perfectly!


Beautiful


Great dress! I'm a size 14 and the Large/XL fit perfectly.  It comes below my knees and I am 5'8''.


I love this dress!! I wore it for Valentine's day, and my husband could not take his eyes off of me!!! I purchased two more dresses in different colors.


runs small


Beautiful dress. I will order more in other colors.


Wow, this dress is so sexy.
