Love this dress! Im 5'8, 135 lbs, i bought a medium/large because my height; fabric is stretchy so it still clings to my body and is not baggy.


Great dress. Comfortable. SHOWS EVERYTHING. Wear a slip or have a perfect body.


love it


I love the way this dress fits. I'm 5'1" and weight 95lbs with a curvy figure. It's always hard finding dresses that fit perfectly. The dress is a perfect length for my height. Will defiantly purchase from this seller again.


Would really recommend finding the right underwear to prevent visible panty lines or sizing up one.


its ok


Stunning dress! Amazing color, fits so well it's like a glove, and SO comfortable!  Wore this for my birthday and couldn't have been more comfortable or felt more glamorous.


ThIs dress fits great! I wore it with gold accessories and a tan blazer with 3/4 sleeves. I wore it with tan shoes. It came together well. Will post a picture later...


loved it but size was to small


Im a curvy size 6. Love it!!! Enough stretch without too much sheen. I ordered a medium in the green. BEAUTIFUL!
