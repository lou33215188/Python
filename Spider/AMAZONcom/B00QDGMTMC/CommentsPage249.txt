I have been looking for a dress that highlights my shape. This is that dress. I do recommend going up 1 size as it is from fitting. I went up one size and it was perfect. I also highly recommend since it is from fitting. A great dress for work and date nights. I envision myself investing in more colors.


Nice sexy casual dress. Wear with heels, sandals or sneakers.


Absolutely perfect! I have a tiny waist (21”) so I have an extremely hard time finding dresses that fit my waist. This fits perfectly


Nice material.  Fits nicely.


material is too thin


Very pretty but it was very very small and tight!!!  I had to return it.


Glad I ordered the next size up!  I love it though, and bought it to always have that little black dress on hand.


Very soft and comfortable!


Had to wash becuase of odd smell when it first came but it's comfortable and fits great!


got this for a halloween costume.  it fit well but you will want to order up one size.  the fabric is a little thin, especially if you stretch it out too much…so get a bigger size.  but for the price it worked for what I wanted.
