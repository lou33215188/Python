Lovely dress, fits well and the colour is exactly as pictured. Very form fitting so muffin tops and bulges are very obvious... I'll need to lose the "holiday cheer" before this dress will look flattering on me. Excellent material also, not too thin but not heavy cotton. Love love love !


Fits nicely, order a size small and it fits to size. Material not bad, haven't worn it yet to have to wash it. I order a black one and what I like about this dress is that I can dress it up and/or dress it down-casual. Great buy for the price.


I ordered this dress a few sizes larger than I actually am because I figured it would be too small but even doing that, the dress was way too small. The material did not make it a flattering dress.


Cute dress. Great fit.

Super cute black dress. When I wear it, I'll post a picture.
