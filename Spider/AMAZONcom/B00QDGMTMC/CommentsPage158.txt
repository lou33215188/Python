Loved it


The material isn't super think, but it's cool if you wear leggings or something under it. Just don't go commando.


I'm a size 5, 145 lbs and I ordered a size small and it fit perfect!


Love this dress


Love it color fit fabric  all of it


All I can say is sexy......the length is perfect (pencil below the knee) and the material looks expensive especially for the price.....I place 2 more in my chart.


Great dress


Great dress, ordering in other colors! Can't beat the price!


Very tight fitting if your wearing spanks underneath just know it will show order one size up
