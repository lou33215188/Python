Fits great on my body and im so small and slim and it hugs my body and makes my body look good


cheap


This is definitely more of a casual dress.


Love the material and the fit on this dress. I ordered a size Small and weight about 130.


I like the dress, but it's clingy, so I have to wear shape wear. I'm 5;7 and 120 lbs. I find it kinda weird.


I ordered a 2x but I could've gotten away with a 1x fits great though will re order nice evening dress


I read that it ran small, so I ordered a size up from normal. It is comfortable, thinner sweatshirt material. It is formfitting so control tops may be needed.


i had previously bought a dress from the same company and i have no complants about that one or this one. Its absolutely gorgeous and wonderfully sliming.. Im about 5'7 and 125 pounds and the medium worked just perfectly with some wiggle room. I will continue to keep buying these wonderful dresses!


I got an XL (I'm a 8-10 dress size, but large chested, large booty) -- loved it, got a ton of compliments on it. But did keep having to adjust the top to cover my bra. The green color is absolutely gorgeous.


Color is not purple
