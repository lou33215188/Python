Kind of see through


It looked nice when placed on, but it's a little bit thin material.


love it


very cute summer dress


Love this dress! Dress it up or down, it's great. I'm 5'1 and a bit pear shaped, usually wear an 8, the M/L fit perfect. I'm giving it 4 stars cuz it shows any rolls or bumps,  so you definitely need spanx. Great dress overall


The fabric is very thin and cheap. Any under garments worn under it WILL show


I really liked this dress. It's the second color I order. It looks elegant and its lightweight. I feel comfortable and stylish in it. I wore it to a wedding. The material is really thin so I have to wear a compressing slip under it to smooth and keep things in place ; )


I would order another color in the future.


Love the quality of the dress and for the price ufff wayyy to good. Its just to be small size is not that tight to the body as it should be


I love it!! It brings out my curves and the material is soft i order two more color right away after receiving the hot pink today. I'm 5'9 and i weigh 180 and the medium/ large  fit perfectly and it bass my knees


Great stretchy fit. Looks good with a jacket or sweater over top (even with my tummy pooch). Good length for a taller person.
