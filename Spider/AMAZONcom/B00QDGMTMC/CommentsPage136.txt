Fit as expected


All of the positive accolades are accurate!  The look and feel are amazing.  My husband doesn't usually like tight fitted dresses on me because he doesn't like me showing off the goods..lol, however this fits tastefully and I love the feel of it!


It didn't last the summer, as a tiny hole formed on the seat of the dress. The shape of the dress was pretty and flattered almost every shape


Love this dress, color and all


Extremely pleased


Really soft, extremely comfortable, and keeps its shape really well!


material is too thin for the type of dress it is


Fits well, fabric is good. The colour is just as in the photo


GREAT fit. Very Sexy


I love how the dress fits.  It's very pretty on.
