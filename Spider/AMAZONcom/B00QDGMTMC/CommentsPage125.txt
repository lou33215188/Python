Love this dress. You can dress it up or down. Material is comfortable and not too thick so it's great for summer.


It's more of a tshirt casual material not stretchy bodycon but still cute. I just wore a blazer on top to dress it up


The dress is super sexy and form fitting close to the body my Hubby was very happy


Plenty of stretch and fits nice without being see through.


I really loved this dress. I am an XS/Small. Wish it was came in the grey in this size!


Great dress for the price...can't wait to wear it.
