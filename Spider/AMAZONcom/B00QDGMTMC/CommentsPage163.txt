5'2, <120 lbs. Small fits great. Casual. Shows every curve!


Love it


Love, love, love this dress! Floats effortlessly over my curves but doesn't expose every imperfection. I'm a busty size 8/10, and the med/large size is a perfect fit.


Love this dress you guys didn't disappoint


Not the best quality but did fit cost more to return than paid.


This dress is amazing. It fit perfectly and looked great on. The material is not exactly what I thought it was going to be but it was still nice. Will definitely be ordering other colors!!


Perfect! Just the way I wanted it! The fabric is sooooo comfortable!!


I was able to wear this pregnant and it was still pretty!


Material is soft but too thin, so dress does not look high end.


Oh how I am in love. I love fitted dresses and this one took the cake! when I took it out of the package it looked small, once I put it on it fit like a glove!!!!
