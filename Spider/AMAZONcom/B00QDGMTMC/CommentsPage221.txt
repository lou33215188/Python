Great fit! Can't wait to wear it


Extremely tight


Not the material I expected, a cute summer dress.  Not Maxi...more like a T-shirt dress


Size 4 and small was too small


I love this dress. The fabric is soft and no see through. Worth my $20.


Perfect fit. Better than expected


Fit me perfectly..just like I want it too.. good buy


Thx


The dress fit great and my daughter loves it!


I love the way it bought out my shape, their dresses is a must-have.
