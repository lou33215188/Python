Stunning. Fits perfect.


Bought this for a friend.  Very poor quality.  For crying out loud, it's polyester! A fabric that is used to make 98% of women clothing.  There should be no excuse for the item to be so cheap looking.  Only good for wearing at home.


The dress was pretty and so was the color but it the fabric is way too thin. Everything is visible under the dress, I was disappointed that I could not wear it out. Too bad I really like the style and the color.


satisfied


I can't wait to wear this dress for my co worker wedding


Awesome material.


Cute


Runs waaaaay too small!


Fit as expected but very thin material almost see through , need to be wore with something underneath.


Nice fit.


I received the dress quickly. The dress is very fitted. You will need to wear a shaper unless you are very fit. It is t-shirt material. I liked it.
