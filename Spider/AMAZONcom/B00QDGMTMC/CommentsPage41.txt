I am 5' 4" and 155 pounds and I got the large/xl and it fits great. It is very form fitting and shows off every curve, but it's comfortable and very presentable.


First I will say that this dress is very comfortable and looks cute, and I've received many complements on it. I normally wear a medium, but after reading the reviews I purchased a large so that it would fit on the looser side, but unfortunately it is much more "bodycon" than I generally wear. It's still very cute though.


Beautiful dress and if fit me perfectly. I'm 5 ft. 104 lbs and I ordered a small. This dress is worth the buy.


it fits AMAZING i love it. i was surprised by the quality/material .. i would recommend and am buying another. Thanks great product


This dress is perfect and extremely versatile. I love it, have worn it many times and it never fails to garner compliments.


I purchased this dress in 2 different colors and I absolutely love it.. Any woman who buys this dress will look wonderful in it..


This dress fits amazingly well.  It hugs every curve to show off your assets.  Will be purchasing in the other colors very soon.  It can be dressed up for an office look or worn on date night.


Looks cheap, but you get what you pay for.


The reason this gets three stars is because the material is see-through. You have to wear something over and under it. It fits close to the body , I got the black in XL. It's goes under the knee , I'm 5'3.


Too small had to send back.
