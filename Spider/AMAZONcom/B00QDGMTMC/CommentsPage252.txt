Very soft and comfortable


I typically wear a size 10 or Large dress. I sawn this was a slim fitting dress so I ordered an extra large. It is still sooo tight you can see every bump and lump.


I wore this dress all through my pregnancy! It made me feel so confident and cute. It hugged me in all the right places. I got a size medium and I got one in a size large since that color was out in medium and it still fit nicely. The best part was that I could fit it even after I had the baby!


Super cute.


This dress runs very small. I ordered an XL  and it fit like an XS! It's not the best material, but I ordered it anyway because I liked the color.


I returned it the next day.


Somewhat on the smaller side.  Material very soft and extremely thin.  Only reason not returning is because it's more of a night gown/long sleep shirt. Would get a 4/5 star for sleepwear.


This dress is so lovely and shows my curves. Its not to tight and very comfortable! Order your correct size. Fast shipping. You can dress this up or  down. I am 5'6 and it is not too long on me either


Great Fit!


Loved this dress, the material is thick and good quality. Well worth the money. Im 5'6" and 173lbs and got a medium/large and ita perfect. If you're tall, get that size.


LOVE LOVE LOVE
