Its nice. Thin material but it didn't fit- was smaller than expected.


Very sexy dress that really clings to the body.


I got the lxl in this dress and its really more like a s/m.so this one is going to my sister who is 5'5 and about 130 lbs.Got home today and my dress was here!!! Super excited true color great fit not extremely  thin .perfect for summer.i just ordered 2 more!!


Love the dress. Glad I read the reviews to get a size up. I am 5'5 and about 165 pounds and I ordered a XL due to my thick thighs lol fits perfect but the dress gets old fast though if washed too often. But great price so whatever! ğŸ˜�


This is a vavoom dress. Too sexy for my busty figure at work, but perfectly professional for a more modest bust. I like it.


I bought the green in this dress and it is as pictured, but I was expected a little harder material. It shows everything. Do not wear to work.


I took the advice of other buyers and ordered one size up. I'm 5'10" and usually a size 2 and I ordered a medium. Fits perfectly! Comes to my knees in length and isn't too tight. Great buy, especially for the price!


Pretty but small and thin


Love the dress. Should have gone a size up kind of form fitting. Im 5'6 160 lbs. But all end all it looks good


I normally wear an large but got an xl just in case and glad I did. Cute, simple green dress. I'm 5'10 so it hits me right at my knees. Material is kind of thin so I wouldn't get this in a light color but am going to buy the black.
