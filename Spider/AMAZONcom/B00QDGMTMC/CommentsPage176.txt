Material quality is low.


Not the right color. The teal is actually a green. Dress is okay.


Great design. Compliments my curves.


It is stretchy (which is a good thing). Perfect to dress up or down.


The dress is super sexy and soft it was thinner than expected but its perfect for the summer I love it


Absolutely love this dress! I am by no means back to my pre baby body but this dress makes me feel awesome.


this dress will make you want to slim down. that's a plan... my husband loved it. because he likes my clothing to fit snuggly...lol


Love this dress...


Fit and colour is good, but is see through and not forgiving must wear with shapewear!


Not size correctly..
