Am in love with this dress its a must have item. It feels so soft on your skin and the fit is like wow. Am in love with this dress.


I love the way this dress fits on my body. The material is a little thicker and heavier so that no underwear lines show. I can add a blazer or a cardigan and I'm set for work!


The fabric is super soft and clings to your body, it's up to you to decide if that is a good thing or not.  It is classy and sexy all at the same time, but I would not wear this to work, rather a night out. I'm 5'4 125 lbs and I feel pretty good in it.


I am 5 foot 5 128 pounds and I should've ordered a medium large the dress is extremely fitted.... however good quality


I thought it would be a little darker but it's fine. The fit is perfect. Everything is perfect.


I ordered my first dress in gray. It does fit extremely close to the body and does reveal lines from under garmets, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I don't wear it with out a cover over, so it works â˜º infact, I bought one in every color.ğŸ˜�


Fits well on my daughter I bought two for both my girls one is a size small one is xxl they both fit well on them well made and sexy go from work to dinner out easisy!


I'm currently pregnant and toss dress fits perfectly over my baby bump, and it's great for any season.


I liked the quality. I went up a size because I prefer a looser feel.


Was not as bright blue as shown in picture. Very simple but wearable. Has a nice fit on your body which brings the beauty out .
