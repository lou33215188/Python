Beautiful dress and true to size. Ordered a medium but i can fit l/xl


This is one of my favorite bodycon dresses. I now have it any two colors the teal and black and plan on grabbing a couple more colors. Extremely comfortable, and love the knee length. I stand 5'11 and a little over 175 and I adore how slimming effect of the dress.


I love this dress it fit well I got a small I am 5'2 150 pounds former all around athlete and lingerie football player I looked very soft in it lol!  Sweetness Jones rock this thanks!


I am 5'6 128lbs and I have now ordered two of these. So classy/ comfortable and sexy. I received many compliments on the green one. my only wish is that it was an inch or so longer so I didn't haven't to always pull down to completely cover my knee. But I just don't care to show more than my lower leg.


I ordered a Large/x-large ... very stretchy material but it's really thin and hugs EVERY curve ... I liked the dress though


I'm 5'7 1/2 about 170 it hits right above the knee! Great date dress.. Great fabric and it's really soft on the skin. It's very fitting so make sure you wear your waist trainer a couple hours prior to wearing it ğŸ˜‰. Overall you should definitely purchase it! The sizes are true to size I ordered a large a med fit but it showed my back fat ğŸ˜ª.


I bought my first dress from this company January of last year and I fell in love with the fit. I was afraid that I wouldn't fit because It's often difficult for me to find clothes that fit my body type. I recently purchased another dress and loved it as well! I ordered an xl. I did not wear any shapewear because it was noticeable through the dress but that was okay with me because I hate shapewear anyway lol. Although the dress is extremely form fitting, I felt really confident in this dress and will be ordering more soon! Also, shipping/delivery is FAST! (The best picture I have is from snapchat, sorry lol)


This is MY very first review with pictures added, I had to!! I have to say the material is amazing, it is not too thick and not too thin it is enough to where you are covered! So comfortable as well! I am 5'3 weigh 140 and bought a medium! I am looking forward to ordering other colors available!!! This is a must have!


I love this dress!!..I bought this dress to wear to the office. The colors are beautiful, perfect length. The only complaint is if you wash and wear on a regular basis, it doesn't hold up well..Gets that fuzzy look. I was very careful washing on delicate cycle, no fabric softener and drying only to a slight dampness. I bought 4 or 5 colors and honestly feel they only lasted a season.That's okay because they don't cost much.  I will definitely  buy them again. It wasn't a huge investment.


Very form fitting n very thin any undergarment will show but I was happy with it
