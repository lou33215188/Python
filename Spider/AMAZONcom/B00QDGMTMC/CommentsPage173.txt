Definitely runs a bit small but cute.


Form fitting, nice blue but not as vibrant as I had hoped. Nice basic dress for the price!


Don't like how it fits nor look


too thin


Fits comfortable and form fitting.  Very pleased with this product.


THis dress fits like a glove!


i love the fit and i love how comfortable it is.


im getting more colors!


like it alot


I had the wine colored dress and the color fits the picture and it hugs your body. The fabric is breathable and soft and comfortable to wear overall.


Fits all of my curves!!! I am 5 ft 130 pounds... It's soooo cute!!! Great material!!!


i wish the material wasn't so sheer.. other than that, it's pretty decent.
