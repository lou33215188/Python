Thin material and long. If you have the body for it and don't mind not wearing underwear go for it.


Can wear this anywhere!


Cute


Just received my 2nd one which I bought a week after my 1st I loved it so much. Got khaki this time. It's definitely more of a faded olive green that a khaki color but love it


Bought in dark green, which is a little lighter than the picture, kind of a kelly/emerald.  Was really surprised how well it fit, how nice it looks, the quality,and the fact that it isn't see thru. It's hard to find jersey dresses like this especially in so many colors. Will be buying more asap!


It's nicer than I thought it would be.  Fits like a glove


Order it and when it came in the dress was just a little too tight.


5'9. 36 DDD. 160 lbs. got m/l very good fit. Stretchy  Perfect dress. Not see through


I wore this under a lab coat for a Princess Bubblegum cosplay. It was perfect and fit very comfortably. I'm not sure about wearing it in life because it is VERY form-fitting, but served a purpose while also being inexpensive.


I love the material.. I ordered a medium/large and the fit was perfect... It wasn't the dark green I expected-more like a spring green. But I kept it because it is pretty. I received it before the shipment date given. Overall it's a great dress!


I absolutely love this dress.. The material is not see through and it so soft and stretchy.. You can literally dress this up or down and you have a day or night outfit in one..
