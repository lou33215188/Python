Little loose at the knee. Was hoping for a tighter fit around the knee, but nothing a $5 alteration can't fix. Can't beat this price.


This dress is so cute! A little tight but the stretch allows for it to still fit comfortably.


Wonderful fit and wear


Absolutely beautiful dress. This dress is skin tight but still looks elegant.
