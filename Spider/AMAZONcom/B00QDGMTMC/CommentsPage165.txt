I have it on black, great quality, very comfortable, this dress in very versatile you can make it formal or casual . I got a size Small, I am 5'7 and 108 lbs and it fits me just perfect.


Loved it


I love the way this dress fits. Just expect for all your curves and bumps, if you got them, to be shown. So, I suggest a shaper underneath, if needed.


I love it!


My dress arrived earlier than expected which was great. Took about 2 days for it to arrive. The color in the picture looks a little darker than the dress, but it fits really good. I ordered the green one.


nice


Great dress. I am going to order more colors


It's  just a t-shirt


I bought this dress in red.  I love the fit I am 5'7" and 170lb,  so I  went with a large,  it is very form fitting and compliments a curvy figure.


Love this dress! It is so comfortable and flattering!
