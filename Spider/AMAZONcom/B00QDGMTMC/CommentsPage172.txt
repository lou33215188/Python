Beautiful dress but way too small and the material clings to every curve...in a very revealing way.


Everything was fine.


Great feel and look. A bit sheer... And a tab small. Love the fabric and construction


Cheap material for price. Definitely was disappointed after reading all the review.


One of my favorite dresses now. Perfect fit, perfect length dress up or down!


I really like this dress. To be worn for cocktails or at the office


It looks like a long t-shirt.


A Little See Through When You Don't Wear The Right Pantys. But Other Than That It's So Cute! I Love It.


Fit jus right beautiful need to get in couple more colours


The dress was a great fit! I loved the material used and the feeling it made my body feel ❤️ definitely worth my money ! Thank you guys !
