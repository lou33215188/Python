Love it! but it's more casual than expected! It's a thinner fabric, like a long tank top.


Hugs all my curves. My girlfriend told me whenever I wear it... she knows I'm trying to tease her or get "some". That's how gud it looks on me. I have it in 3 colors and I'm gonna order more colors.


I was disappointed at the thin fabric.Probably good for a hot day,but it's fairly sheer. Color is accurate.


It's a little long. But fits perfect


very pretty


Great material, fit as expected, looks just like the picture. Its double layered so it's not see through. I am 5'8 and 140lbs. I bought a medium and fits just right.


Love it...fits perfectly!


The dress runs small, my suggestion is buy a size up. Also, the dress shows everything, so buying a size up will help eliminate showing too muhc (unless you're that kinda gal) I plan to buy more, maybe in a darker color.


Fits like a glove


Love this Dress!
