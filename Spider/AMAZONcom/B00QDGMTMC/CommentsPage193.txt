My sister loved the dresss ... She wears a small got her a medium and it fit good.


love this dress. would recommend getting a size smaller than you need. love the soft stretchy fabric. perfect length. well worth the price


Fabric is sheer


Very pretty dress. I'm in the process of loosing weight so I'm looking forward to wearing this dress in my new body!!


Nice basic for your summer wardrobe


I wish there was just an XS, would've fit a bit better but am still very happy!


Loved this dress soooo much I bought another one


It fit well and worked well for a bridal shower


Ridiculously small. I couldn't even get a large on my size 8 body:


Love this style dress I bought another dress. Fits perfect!
