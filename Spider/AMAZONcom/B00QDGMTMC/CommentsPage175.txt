Fits as expected


Love it. I purchased the dark green and its a lovely dress.


Love love love. Stretchy. Clingy. Comes right to my knee. Office wear cool with a blazer.


Fit like a glove!!!


I ordered medium but I got Large...and still tight..make sure you order bigger size


Love it!


This is my third dress that I have ordered from Tom's Ware and I absolutely love them. They are extremely comfortable and can be dressed up or dressed down to suit your own personal style needs. Great purchase!


It's a casual dress, soft material but kinda see through. I wanted to wear this for work but can't. It's more of a casual around the house kind of dress.


Package came on time and the dress fits like a glove. The bottom band is not as fitted the rest of the dress. But overall will be purchasing another one or two.


I love this dress...
