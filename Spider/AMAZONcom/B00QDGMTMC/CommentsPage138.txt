Fits extremely well. The colour is pretty. Very comfortable


The shape is great but the fabric is low quality.


Loved it, beautiful dress! It hugs your body very well so it shows panty lines. I wore something underneath to make sure I had no lines! Plan accordingly!


Every item I've purchased from Toms ware are my favorite outfits, I am very happy with the dress.


I bought this dress in a medium. The fabric is soft and it definitely clings to the curves.


Love this dress!


sizing runs to small


I really like this dress, but beware it exposes all your flaws so you might consider wearing a body shaping slip. Also the color is a lot more bright than the picture, more of a bright Irish green.


This is a perfect dress but it was a bit too small.


Was better than I expected . I love this dress & will be ordering more for the summer . The fabric is nice & isn't sheer ! Order your actual size
