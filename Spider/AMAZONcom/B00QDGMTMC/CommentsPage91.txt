Love the fit and color of this dress. Exactly as is online..very sexy. Great seller


Great basic jersey dress.  Watch how you wash it, it will pill up if you don't take care of it.


Great dress (especially for the price) but note that it is very fitted - I bought a large and am usually a small/size 4 in dresses. The large is still fitted but not too tight - fits perfectly!


Sexy and fitted doesn't make your stomach look pronounced so that's great


I'm 5'4", 145lbs and D cup. Small/medium fits perfectly and falls over the knees. I loved it so much, I order it in more colors.


Bought a black dress for my wife and she loved it so much, she bought a blue dress. She is 4' 8 and 120 pounds. She's is physically toned pear shaped with a lot of back. I got her a medium and it fit perfectly. The dress will show the details of your body and it looked amazing on her.


WAY small. Order up at least one size. I usually wear a small, I ordered a medium and it fits like a small.


Perfect but dress was totally different color :(


Beautiful dress, but even thou I got a dark red, it still is see trough


It's a good quality garment for the price. Hugs curves. Still tasteful.
