Its a beautiful dress, it's just smaller than I thought it would be. And a  bit transparent when  it comes to bras.


It says GREEN but it looks like TEAL on the picture. Well, it is actually GREEN. I was hoping for TEAL. Other than that, it is a great deal.


Extremely pleased with the quality and fit of this dress! The price was excellent and ultimately, I ordered 3 more in different colors.


Good fit.


Love these drssses super comfy and stretchy


It fit really well this dress is beautiful but the color was not what I except is really pink and I wasn't excepting pink but I'm happppy for my dress


I love the color but the material is very thin.


Fits really well and the material is not extra thin so it's no see thru ;)


Bought this for my daughter. She was happy it fit close and not loose. Ordered one in gray try to color


I am consistently a size 8/10 and followed the measurement guide and it was extremely too small. Will be returning.
