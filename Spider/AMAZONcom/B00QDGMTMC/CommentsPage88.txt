A- ma-zing!!


Beware! The material is thin and will show every nook and cranny of your body...panties/bra and all. I'm a size 6 and ordered a MED. I think next time I'll order a Large so that it's not so clingy. Definitely order a size up. You'll need a slip no matter what body type you are! I wish the material was a little bit thicker.


Fits snugly. Great bodycon dress. I ordered three more in different colors!


These are great dresses for affordable prices. Iâ€™m on my third pair!!!!


i am so in love with it. i want every color.


This dress is probably one of my favorite additions to my wardrobe. It fits great and goes well with anything.


I'd give it 5 star if it wasnt so thin.but other than that its a simple black dress that fits my curves.


Love it


fits perfect, I am 163 lb ordered large and can say looks great. thank you


Very comfortable and very well constructed dress.  It does run small so size up at least one size. I am 5'5" and weigh 135. I normally wear a small and ordered a large and it fits great.
