Fits a little snug and I am quite small but it's pretty.  I ordered two dressed the lavender and the red.  I never received the red one. :(


Great fabric and i look great in it.


I love this dress! Very versatile, you can dress it up or keep it casual.


nice


Well made and fits perfectly!! I ordered a small. I'm usually a size 2. 5'4 120lbs.


I'm going to order in more colors!


Soft and very flattering for a very fitted dress.  I'm thin, but not toned and this dress clings to all the right places! Very happy with this dress!


It's a very cheap cotton dress- reminds me of a swim cover up.  I added a cardigan and it's do-able but way too thin to wear alone.


The best dress I have purchased in a long time.  I am 5'2" 135lbs and it was not too sexy for the office but just enough.


I think I will get these in every color.  Very easy to dress up or down depending on the event!


Good for the price


perfect fit, looks fantastic.


Comfortable and great fit.
