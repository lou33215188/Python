I like the dress. I ordered on blue because I want to wear it with a striped blazer. The color is same as the picture. The fabric is a little thin and the dress fits tight. I ordered XL size and I usually wear size L.


I purchased this dress for work. In black, the dress is comfortable - opaque.  I am 5'7" and the dress covers right down to my knees. It is exactly what I needed.


I ordered an XXL. I'm a size 12 and could hardly get it on. I also didn't care for the fabric.


Looks and feels good on true to size


Sexy and snug, fits perfectly. I ordered a small/xs and i am 5'0 100 lbs and it fits like a glove.


Great dress.  I love it and get compliments on it each time I wear it.
