Color was true to picture, style was as well, but this material is very thin. If I order it again I will get darker colors so you dont see lines!


I bought two of these dresses. I love how it hugs your figure.


Fits perfectly.  Shows off My curves very nicely.


LOVE this Dress!!! It fits perfect and so smooth and comfortable


Great dress but thin stretchy fabric that my body wasn't able to handle. Lol


If you can go commando ( because this shows ALL the panty lines), it fits well and looks good.


Looks great on! Only concern is the material can easily pill after several washes.


Fit very well. I'm 5'3" and it goes down to a little below my knees. I'm very please with the colour, I purchased it in royal blue. The fabric is very stretchy so don't worry about ordering a size up.


A little too snug of a fit for me


Color not as ad picture but Im pleased with the item


This dress fit great! Hugged my curves perfectly. The material is soft and very comfortable. I got the light grey color. Loved it!
