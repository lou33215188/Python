loved the fit- hugs but not tooo snug


I plan to dress this up with jewelry and heels when I wear it on our cruise!


Is very good quality and I got it very quickly


Cute for the price. I'm 5'5 and about 155 lbs. The medium /large is a good fit.


Shows every lump and bump....beware


You get what you pay for!!!!!


I bought this in x-large and it came no where close to fitting gave it to my daughter who is a small.


I like the feel and fit of this item.  Shipping and delivery was on the money.


Very lightweight and comfortable. I'll probably buy one in each color.


fits perfect
