I absolutely LOVED my dress so I ordered another one in Burgundy and it was great! Defiantly recommend for anyone who wants ALL their curves to be shown off!


The material is thinner than i wanted but it fits really well. I bought the black and will buy in another color.


Will be great for a Spring. Just need to accessorize with a blazer, earnings, shoes. I will recommend if you need a light, thin dress for spring. The dress is very thin.


Love this dress...I bought it in 2 colors


Great dress. It does run to the size. It's a little thin but server's the purpose very appealing to any size or figure.


The dress is ok it just runs small. I am an XS


Love this. So versatile and figure flattering.


The dress fits perfect and is super comfortable.


I return this dress the moment I opened the package. Its now like nightgown not a dress. Very cheaply made and completely see thru.


Looks great on. My daughter loved her dress
