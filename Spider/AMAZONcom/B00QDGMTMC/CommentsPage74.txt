Cute dress. The fit was a little too tight for my liking, but I am sure if I ordered a one size up, it would fit perfectly. I am debating as to whether or not i should re-purchase it in a larger size or just return the dress in its entirety.


This is a review for the Tom's Ware classic slim fit sleeveless midi dress... I love, love, love this dress the color green is great it fit just as I expected and hugged all the right spots, though it was longer then I was expecting for a midi but I didn't mind. I wore this dress to a wedding and I had heads turning. Just a great buy all around I recently bought the same dress but in black hope I love it as much as I did this dress.


Fit so well! Stretchy without feeling "stretched out" and unshapely.  I still had a few "lumps" but those were mine and not the fault of this dress. ;)


Nothing but compliments-paired it with a short jacket for a corporate event.  Fabric is a little light so treat gently- for 20 bucks you know the deal.


The green looks very different than online, more of an emerald than teal. Not what I wanted. Pretty basic dress, stretchy  like leggins. Returning.


Dress for perfect tight and form fitting I'm 5'2 100lbs order a Small


simple and nice.  somewhat small. order a size or two larger plus a blazer could be a perfect 5-star for office wear.


Love the outfit. Fitted properly. Can't wait to rock it


I love this dress


It is what I wanted


A thicker material would be nice..or at least a slip. It's very sheer but I love the cut and how it fits. I would stick to wearing this at night where the sheerness isn't as noticeable.
