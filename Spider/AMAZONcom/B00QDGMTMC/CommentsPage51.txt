Omg this dress is so sexy on me, everyone loves it, I got so much compliments,  I will be ordering every color .


Nice dress, I do recommend wearing a slip under it though because the material is thin and flimsy. But it's inexpensive and as with all unlined clothes, a slip or undergarment is expected to be necessary. It's comfy and perfect for work with a pair of smart pumps and a blazer or cardigan.


Absolutely loved this dress. I received it sooner than expected just in time for my baby shower. I am 5'5" and it fit just below the knee. Material is somewhat thin. Seamless underwear solve the issue.


I went one size up from my usual and it fit a little snug. I do plan on keeping it. I would just go up one more size. I think itâ€™s the type of material which I like but just need a smudge more room.


Love it! Added a sweater for work. I am 5'9" 174 lbs.


I got the blue todau and while it seems a bit darker than the picture it's still very comfortable,  very sexy and amazing. Somewhat shorter than the black one I bought but I'll still buy one more.


Nice


It is true to it's size and for the price it's a great buy. I loved how I look in it got a lot of compliments.


Perfect! I love this dress. I had ordered another Tom's Ware dress in February so I figured this would work. Thick enough to make you feel secure and not have your underwear be visible. Simple & sexy.


Cute but you better be confident because it's supet tight.
