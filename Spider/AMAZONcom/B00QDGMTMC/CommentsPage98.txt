Fits well but I received the wrong color!....I ordered Teal and received Green instead. Very disappointing because i ordered Teal for a reason!


Beautiful fits perfect color is pretty.


Snug but breathable. I'm 5'5" 145lbs and the dress is right at my knees. I got a size medium and it's a good fit. Not too tight too. The material is not too thin and not thick either.


I  bought it in 3 colors at 3 different times. The colors are true to the pictures. This is my go-to dress.


The dress fit really nice. The material is also not bag for the price you pay. A simple dress  so you have to dress it up a little. I wore with a cute scarf.


Purchased the charcoal gray. Fell in love. Had to order the black! :0)


love this dress want it in every color


not stretchy material


I really wanted to wear this dress and liked the color, length and style very much!  However, this dress was just TOO CLINGY particularly in the rear.  I had bought it for work but even the XL was too tight to wear in a professional environment.


FYI:  I am a US Size 6.  I read the material information listed and knew it would be somewhat clingy but figured with the stretch it wouldn't be a problem.  I was surprised since I ordered an XL.


The other issue is that once I removed the dress from the plastic it had a TERRIBLE smell.  Had I kept the dress, it would have needed to be washed before I wore it.


I have a curvy shape even though I'm small.  Anyway, I could not exchange it for a larger size since I already had the largest size available.


 If I still went to bars and clubs, I might have kept it since super clingy clothes are fine in those situations.  But for work, it wouldn't be appropriate.


I'm disappointed since it really is a pretty dress and the coverage is perfect.  Just too too tight!
