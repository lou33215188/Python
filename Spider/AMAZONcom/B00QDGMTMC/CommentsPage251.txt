Actually made better than I expected.


I'm a very petite person. I'm 5ft and weight 100 pounds and this dress was super tight (XS size) . Like many reviews here, if you're thinking about wearing an underwear underneath... good luck.


tight


Very pretty dress and good quality! i chosse an small it fits great!


Love it. Got it in two colors. Can wear alone or as an underneath layer.


I wear a 12-14 so I ordered the XL/XXL. It fit way too small. It is too tight and show everything about your body. I can't wear it.


Couldn't be more satisfied with the fit, the price, the quality - I work in a hospital setting and can wear this with a cardigan and be comfortable all day.


I love it i am very curvy so it fits to alll my lumps and i love it!


i love it even more because i can wear it whenever. I got the M/L because of my measurements but it stretches very very well i recommend it. because i am 5'0 it goes pass my knees and that makes me love the look even more


I was surprised by rhe material.  This is like a Jersey dress with a tight fit but I'm thinking it qill not stretch out of shape.


It looks amazing! Fit very well!
