ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS DRESS. IT ACCENTUATES ALL MY CURVES AND I CAN DRESS IT UP OR DOWN.  YOU JUST CAN'T LOSE!!


Very nice clingy dress.  Simple made ok.


Great Dress. Fits just right.  Many people said it was see through, but I think they just ordered too small.  mine fits perfect, and is not see through. It IS very clingy and shows all curves, but that was the point of buying it for me. I am happy with this dress and will probably buy in other colors. :)


I bought this dress in green it hugs my body like a glove and shows all my curves it's a very flattering dress it makes u feel "sexy", I am definitely going to order some more colors, the only downside of it is that the material is kinda thin but nothing an appropriate underwear can't fix love this dress!!!!!!


Love this dress. Get so many complements. Perfect for an hourglass figure who wants to rock her curves.


JUST RECEIVED AND I LOVE IT. WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE IN A DIFFERENT COLOR AS WELL.


I am typically a size small (women's 4-6), but based on other reviews ordered a medium- and it is still too small!!! Perhaps I should have gone for an XL?! The fabric is incredibly thin, you can see EVERYTHING because of the combiniation of thin fabric and the fact that it is very tight. I regret this purchase and wish it were worth the time and efort to return it. The only way I may ever be able to wear it is over tights and under a sweater, not at all what I had in mind.


Purchased for my daughter, she loves the way it fits, very comfortable!


love this dress! so comfortable & easy to wear. based on other reviews, I did buy a size larger than I usually get, and it ended up fitting perfectly. I plan to buy a few of the other colors too.


Runs small
