I didn't receive the dress I purchased but I like the one I received


Great dress for the price


I'm a CURVY woman lol! This made me feel super sexy!!


Dress cannot be worn without an undergarment. Fabric very low quality.


I purchased in a size XXL, I am 5'5".  the material is thin and shows every bump; however, a nice undergarment or blazer will take care of that.


I was worried about the shade of red but it is as pictured. Everything as pictured, no unpleasant surprises. I got XS-S and this dress fits me just fine (5'1", 30"chest, 24" waist). I love this dress because it is the perfect blank canvas.


This dress fits perfectly. I will definitely be buying more of these. When the package came, the box was a bit big. The dress comes to the middle of my knees (I'm 5'5"), and it hugs my body, showing off my curves (and I do not have many 115 lbs).


Poor quality,see through.


You will need to wear undergarments that are very smooth as lines will show through.  I'm going to try some sparks snd a wireless bra. They should also be a similar color as the dress.  Shows all your curves! Nothing is left to the imagination!


So thin, I can't really see myself wearing this. There is no level of undergarment that can be worn under this dress. It gives away every line and crease.
