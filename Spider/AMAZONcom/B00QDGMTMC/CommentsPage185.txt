I love this dress great quality the dress hug all your curves.


This dress is fantastic! I was unsure because of the price, thinking it might be see-through or have poor quality/fabric. But it looks great! It is tight and doesn't hide much, so be prepared if you're still trying to drop a few pounds. It ended right above my knee so still looks classy even though it's tight. I ordered one and loved it so much I ordered 5 more colors! I'm 5'8" and weigh 140.  I usually wear a size 6. The M/L fit the best, although I got the first one in S/M and it's not too tight to wear, but I ordered the rest in M/L. Also, the shipping was pretty quick. I received it in about 4-5 days.


Prefect. I love it n very sexy
