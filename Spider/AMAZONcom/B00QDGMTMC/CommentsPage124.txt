This is very thin jersey material. It is a cute, t-shirt dress. Unfortunately, my figure is not flattered by the fitting cut and thin material.


Runs like tight spandex, it's thick material and suckers things in a little bit, I like the fit.


This dress fit like a glove! I received compliments all night.


Material is extremely thin making everything visible from panty lines to trouble areas. Will be returning.


Fabric is pretty sheer and cheap but that was expected given the price point. It did the job though.


cute


i love my dress it fits perfectly its just a bit see through in the bust area and it shows the lining of your underwear but other than that i like it


It looks a lot better on. Worth the price.


The dress is cute, the material reminds me of a regular T shirt fabric.


I am 138lbs 5'5 I got US S size.


Be ready that the dress will show every wrinkle and body curve.


Buy a bigger size.
