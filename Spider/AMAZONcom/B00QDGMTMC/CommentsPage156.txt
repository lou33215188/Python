Order 2 sizes larger than you normally wear


I love the fabric of this dress. It fits just perfect


Fits ok but needs a slip underneath.  Very thin. Can be worn wit a jacket.  Easy to pack.  Shows curves.


Nothing exciting about this dress just a bland black dress and the material isn't the finest either.


Perfect fit! I'm 5'4'' and 96 pounds so I have trouble finding clothes that don't sag on me. Absolutely love this dress and will be ordering more colors!


Fast shipping ... Poor quality. The dress is very thin and does not look like the one pictured


OMG this is the best dress I have ever bought. I bought a medium and it hits right at/below my knee (5'4 and 160 lbs). Hugs every curve and can be dressed up or down.


I purchased this dress in red for my babyshower and it fits very comfortably it's classy and doesn't reveal to much just hugs body right which makes it sexy can't wait to wear and dressed it up with some jewelry


I'm 5'4 and 160lbs I have big breast so I got a medium/large dress. The dress fits tight and very well it can be dressed down or dressed up. I got the navy blue one and I like it a lot


Dress is nice  ... but it's tooo thin seethru you can seee everything  ... good length  ... wouldnt buy again.
