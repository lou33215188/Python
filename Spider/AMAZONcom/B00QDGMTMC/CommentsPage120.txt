I love these dresses for the price and they fit amazing I'm 5 '4 and i am 128lbs i get the xs/s and it fits perfect


True to size its a little bit to big for me


Great for lounging or going shopping.  My favorite summer time dress.


I loved the color but it is see through and the material is thin. Like, im not exaggerating when i say thin. i bought this for a lounge/ cocktail party and quickly changed my mind. However for a regular summer outing with a light wash jean jacket, very nice!


Starting my arm sleeve so I was looking for a comfortable dress I could show off my ink & also wear to walk to the mall near my house ! The cotton is very soft ! Which is great since I live in Miami where it can easily be in the 80s


I love!!!! Was a bit worried about the sizing. I'm an xl bought xxl. Xxl fits okay but will order xl next time


Very good material and true to size. The packaged arrived very fast. I will definitely order more


Little shorter than the others


This was well worth the money however the dress has a funny smell to it :( But it clings onto the body as expected


My product was to big so I send back the dress
