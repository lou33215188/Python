I bought a pink and purple one. I love the fit only thing is the lighter the color the more see thru


Did not like fabric to thin and cheap looking.


Go up a size


extremely good for the price!


The material is cheap.... I guess u can wear an expensive blazer with it, and make it looks nice.


Love this dress.. Fits like a glove


Good quality !!!  Wear them all the time with leggings and get compliments all the time.


Very sexy and simple LDB. It looks a little shear though.


I ordered this for a funeral.  I am usually a 2/4 and ordered a medium to be on the safe side.  It was so tight, it had that shiny look spandex gets.  The material also appeared to have faint snags in it.


It's a bit thin but still nice. I'm 5'3 and it reaches slightly below by knees. I thought it was grey from the image but it's a bit grayish green.
