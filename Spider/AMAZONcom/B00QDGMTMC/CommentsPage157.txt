Too thin but very sexy~! Need proper underwear.


It's ok


I love this dress.  Fits great.  Very sexy bit comfy


Too small and material is thin


Not what I expected.


Fits my hour glass body type nicely. Flattering color. I gave  4 stars only because the material is a bit thin.


Glad I read the comments and ordered a size up. Not lined so make sure your in shape!


Fits as expected, the green isn't as dark as it appears on the photo but it's a beautiful dress.


way too small, gave it away to a friend


Great buy
