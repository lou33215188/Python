Bought for work but the dress is made of tshirt like fabric not work appropriate


S/M fit her perfectly.  5'9" normally size 2.  Just at the knee.  Well made with good material.  Very nice color.  Shipping on time as normal with Amazon.


I love wearing this dress underneath a knitted shell sweater. Its body hugging but really comfortable.


This dress is very flattering. It's form fitting, so I opted to pair it with a jacket. However, it's a simple dress that makes a bold statement. It's a thin material, but not sheer.


love this one. nice color and better material (maybe the material is the same, but due to the color, it see through) than the pink dress. I like them both.


I loved this dress so much I bought 4 more!! The dress is fitted so I had to go up a size, from a medium to a large. This dress clung to every curve without making you look like you're suffocating. The material is also soft & maintains its color after 3 washes so far. I do plan on ordering other colors in the future.


I love getting new clothes that have been tried on, are super wrinkly, and have deodorant all over them. Particularly in black so the white shoes extra well!  The item itself might be cute, but I need to get past the quality control issue


My favorite... On Wednesdays we wear pink


The blue dress is made of a nice fabric and bright color (as shown in the picture). The cut is knee length and hugs the body. for reference I'm 135lbs, 5ft 3in tall, 34A  and I bought the size small/medium. You can dress it up with a pair of nice heels or dress it down with some nice sandals.


Love it! Great feel. The fabric is great. I wore spanx just in case. Its thin but not see through. I was complimented all night. The color great as well.
