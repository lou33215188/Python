Great fit


I don't understand the 5 star reviews, this is a poorly made dress.  material is cheap, not worth more than $3 and that is being generous


There was NO belt with or on the product as advertised.


I just received my dress and it fits amazing! Love it, highly recommend.


Love these dresses!


The color was the same but the style was more of a long tank top shirt dress. I will be returning immediately.


Was not as described.  I disliked strongly.  Cheap fabric. Fabric looks and feels like sweat pants material.  No spandex so all in perfection Of your body is highlighted


The dress is well-made and would look great for a date night, but it's too tight to wear to work. I'm 5'2, 129 lbs and got the S/M (it says M on tag)- I guess I should have bought a large, instead.


Love it!! Good quality, fit as expected, and super cute!


I was skeptical because of complaints about the fabric being too thin.  I have no issues.  As a matter-of-fact, I buying another dress once finish with this review.
