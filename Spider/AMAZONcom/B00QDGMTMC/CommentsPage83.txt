Fits perfect.


You get what you pay for. For me, this dress is too tight and not flattering. I didn't care for the material. But honestly, I can't complain too much because it is a very inexpensive dress at the end of the day.


Sorry, this dress does not meet my expection. Is cheap material, not worth the moneyğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


Very small, material is cheap. No return label, would have returned it. Going to donation pile. I was very disappointed.


I took away a star because it's completely see through and I had to return. I bought the light pink. It may have worked with a slip of some sort but that's too high maintenance for me. I do love Toms Ware still


See through


CURVES, CURVES, & MORE CURVES FOR DAYS!! yesss!! This dress flatters a curvaceous figure!!!


Fits perfect. I'm 4-11 and a curvy 140lbs and I got an XXL. I had previously bought this dress in a XL and it fit but a little snug so I gave it to my cousin. The XXL fits much better.

Dress is perfect! Great length too. This is a form fitting dress. I am usually a small I bought a Medium and it is still fitted. Love the green color and everything about the dress. Perfect for work.
