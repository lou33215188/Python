Material is thin but the fit is excellent. Can be dressed up or down.


I am so happy with the quality of this dress!


Love this dress. My measurements are 35 28 40 & this fit very well in a large. I can tell that theres some stretch in it so even if my measurements were slightly bigger I'd still order the large. Teal color was nice but not really teal, more blue ish. It will show every curve which is awesome but also every lump and bump so choose your underwear wisely. The material is not thin or cheap feeling but the dress is meant to be bodycon.


Fits the body like a glove!


Fit great and arrived before it was scheduled.


Best with a blazer. Short of see through.


exactly what I was looking for. Fits great! i will be pairing it with a cardigan otherwise, it would be a little see through.


This dress is super cute and sexy, it definitely clings to your body. I am a true size 10 and brought a extra large.


The dress had a hole on the front. This is a nice basic dress, but thin fabric & low quality.


The size of the item is, like 2 sizes smaller then it should be. It showed XL but I had my aunt who wears a sz 8 try it on and it fit her perfectly.
