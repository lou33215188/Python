Really good quality for price, a bit short on me but I'm 5'11" so it was kind of expected.  This dress will not hide your flaws so don't expect miracles!!!


I love this dress it's really simple so you can dress it up or down I plan to get more colors for my vacation next year.


excellent


Pretty dress. Great for it's price. Multi-purpose, and flattering in spite of being somewhat thin material. Suggest getting the black dress for that reason.


This is an edited review. I rated this dress poorly, but decided to wear it. This dress actually looks very nice on when dressed up. However, it had an odor initially. Perhaps it was factory. The odor was gone the next day.


I purchased the blue. Gorgeous color. Definitely a tight fitting dress. I had to purchase shapewear to go underneath. Bought it for a wedding and I'm excited to wear it! Will probably purchase additional dresses in other colors.


Beautiful love it


Great fit


Colour is as shown and fit is true to size.


However this dress is not lined and will show every lump and bump on your body and your underwear will show through. If your gonna buy keep in mind you will have to get it lined.


I normally wear a size 16, but this was more like a 12. Too bad, I really liked the look.


The material is not the best but it's OK.  It fits really nice though
