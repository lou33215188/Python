Beautiful


Loved this dress! Fits like a glove.


Cut very small


Nice party dress.


Will be ordering more


More of a vibrant green than the teal/forest green.


Material way too thin.  Looks cheap. Sent back.


Very nice. I love form fitting cotton dresses, and this one is slightly thicker/nicer than they usually are. Watch out-- they run slightly small. I'm 5'7", 130-135, and the small/medium was good but slightly tight. Looks awesome, but if I were any bigger it would not have worked


Not the same color


Beautiful dress...i love it
