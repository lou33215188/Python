Not like the fabric is of poor quality


Fit as expect. Thin fabric but stretches well


Love it


Nice dress, fits pretty well


Love it!  Quick shipping and perfect fit!


A large was more like a xl and I wear a 8 in dress It's not worth the price


Disappointed with quality of the dress. Poor material


Loved the dress. Hugged my body, stopped right below knee as I liked, however, purchased in another color and it was right above the knew. The fit was great, however, I like dresses that fall under my knees or longer.


Shipped quickly, fit like a glove, love it


Love the fit and it's very conservative!
