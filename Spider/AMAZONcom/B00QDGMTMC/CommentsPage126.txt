too small.


This dress is just an awesome fit.. The material is stretchy but not too thin.. Dress it up or dress it down..I purchased both black and grey


It's really thin. It doen't look like the picture. It's a great color and length though


The dress fits as expected. I've purchased a couple them before. The only thing was it was a bit thinner than the dresses I've gotten previously. I had to puchase seamless under garments.I still want to purchase other colors and styles.


It kind of see through because the material is so thin


Nicely done for price, but runs extremely small. I ordered the XL usually wear a 10 at most, and this dress is skin tight.


very pretty but somewhat small.


This is excellent. I think I will buy more. Good quality material, nice length and good fit. I am tall so I always am scared that dresses will be too short or way shorter than I I want them to be. This is excellent.


nice


The Dress Fits Fine. Thin Fabric. Quality is Minimal. The Sleeve's Width is Not At All What I Expected. It's Like a Long Tank Top, Basically. I Was Hoping for a Sheath Dress Type, But The Sleeves Just Throw That Off. Not Worth the Price I Paid For It.
