I really like the dress but is too small I had to send it back


I love the dress but the fabric is like a thick jersey and I thought it was a thick cotton. It's very fitted as well but is very cute.


I love this dress. It is everything that I expected!! Fits perfectly


Fit perfectly and the material is light and soft. Very comfortable and will buy again in other colors.


Love it


Fits like a dream, but thankfully I read some reviews ahead of time to know to buy it one size larger.  So comfortable and flattering.


Extremely see through, and no slip is going to be able to be put underneath.


Good quality


Super comfy and stretchy material. Love the color and the price but after the first wash it started to ball up. Great for wearing around the house or doing yoga in. I have 2 of these dresses and I really like them but they just don;t wash well.


Love this dress it fits well it's soft & very well made just bought two more dresses today
