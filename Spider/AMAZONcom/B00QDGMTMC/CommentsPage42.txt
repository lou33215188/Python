Wish I could buy this dress in every color available! My roomie and I both share this dress for work and get compliments all the time as well as stay comfortable after a 10 hr work day. Amazing product. Well made. Flexible material. Love it!


I love it!  Came very fast! Light, soft fabric! Perfect length even for a short person. Im 5' 130 skinny thick with a booty. Got a small/medium. Hugs all my curves and looks amazing on my booty. Just ordered three more in other colors.


The fit of this dress is great but the material is thin so I bought other colors and layer it.  I'm 5'6" 120 lbs. and the XS fits me perfectly.


poor quality... don't buy


WAYYY to tight, great material and length though.


I would order a Medium if you are normally a small.


It would be an incredible dress if it were a printed material, then it wouldn't show


EVERYTHING you own.  lol.  I would buy it again.


Yes really nice and I'll buy more


I am a size medium, purchased a size large and may not hurt to have purchased a size xl. This dress is too clingy for most professional environments, unless you are wearing a SEAMLESS slip. This is a very tight fitting dress that scrunches up at that bottom if too fitted. The dress material is soft and t shirt like. The color on the image is mis-leading, the green dress is spring green and bright!


It's a panties free one though! I have a dress slip that's perfect under it. The fabric is nice but very form fitting. Not brave enough for other colors but the black is classic and curvy without looking like a hooker!!


Please excuse my mirror lol,


Dress is slightly tight but so see through:)


I like a tighter fit, I am 5'3" 135lbs


If you like it tight and a bit see through then it's for you! Dress keeps coming up when I walk, more for a night out than work.
