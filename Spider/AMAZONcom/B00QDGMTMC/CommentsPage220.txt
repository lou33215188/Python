The worst thing I ever bought as far as a clothing outfit, look like two cheapest red pieces of fabric you find in an old throw out bend sowen together quickly trying to make a dress out of UGLY cheap thin off red color rags, guess u can sleep in it, cause there's no way I would wear it anywhere calling it a dress, SUPER PLAIN UGLY OFF COLOR RED, NO SHAPE, NO DESIGNS NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT IT. NOT EVEN AS TO SLEEP IN IT. U STILL DON'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE IT, OR DARE TELL THEM IT IS CALLED A DRESS TO STEP OUT INTO A LAUNDRY MAT. THATS HOW BAD IT IS. BEWARE OF SELLER CAUSE HE REALLY FELLED THIS ONE. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIS OTHERS, BUT I'M TELLING YOU BOUT THIS ONE.


perfect fit


Â This dress is so nice & skin tight !! Fits every curve of me . Date night went well


Nice a little  too thin


Fits great! Love it!


The material is nice and soft, and stays alive in the wash after two years. Wear nude colors underneath as the material is slightly sheer when stretched. It clings to your body so make sure not to be eating/drinking excessively before and during wearing, otherwise there will be apparent bulges. I get compliments when wearing. Currently 5'3, 118lb. and purchased the small.


Tip: Wear on an empty stomach/ eat lightly. It helps to drink water and eat less salty food to prevent bloating.


Fits Right In All The Right Places!! Love It!!!


Love it going to order more


Great fit.


Love it
