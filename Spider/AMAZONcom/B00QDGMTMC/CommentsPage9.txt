This fits so much better than I had hoped for! I'm 5'10" and about 165lbs and it's plenty long. I bought it specifically to wear with a galaxy corset I bought, so I'm sorry my picture hides the dress a bit.


If you're long for  2nd layer of skin, look no further. This is so tight it could only be called 2nd skin. It rides up a lot when you wear it so I don't know hire anyone could wear this outside unless they're comfortable with pulling it down every few steps. I walked from my living room to my bedroom and it went from a midi dress to a tank top. It's cool for in my home with my husband but that's it. It is sexy though so in the house w/your man=5 stars,  outside looking sexy=2 stars. It just isn't practical on account of pulling it down so much. If I purchased a larger size it would still happen, it's the fabric and cut.


I am 5'9, 150lbs. I purchased the Medium/Large and it fits great. It's long enough where I can throw a blazer over and wear to work, or scrunch it up and wear it out as a mini dress. I purchased the Green color. It's a pretty, bright green (not army green, as I originally thought). Perfect color for spring time. Fabric is soft and stretchy, and super comfy. I highly recommend it.


I probably should have ordered one that wasn't as long. My short legs don't look good in a long dress. I like the height of the neck line. Being larger chested it's nice to be able to cover them up and feel confident in the dress I'm wearing. Material is on the thinner side. I would have expected the price point to be a little lower once I saw the quality. It also stretches out throughout the day. Starts nice and snug and has ability to scrunch up in the middle and by the end of the day it's loose and feels more like a baggy t-shirt.


Honestly - I bought a large for my 5'8, 160lb, 36G body-- and it looked absolutely horrendous.  Seriously, I looked like blue playdough.  So I took it off, and laid it on the bed, preparing to dress and immediately return it.  However, then my 13 year old, 5'8", 105lb, 32C bodied daughter walked in the room and said "oh! is this for me??!".  She put it on-- and was stunning.


Note to self-- I will never look as good as she does (if you like slender.  If you like curvy, I win.)  And I should always run all purchases past her prior to returning, since she can make anything look great.


Added context-- it's been 8 years since I've seen my daughter wear a dress.  Win-Win!


Con:  My husband took one look at her and said "she's not leaving the house in that, she looks 18".


Sure, it's a stretchy dress and I *could* wear it, but not nicely.  Be aware of that before purchase-- unless you have the body of my 13 yr old.


Whoa, it would be very sexy if it didn't show every detail of my pacemakerğŸ˜�


I love these dresses. I got the black one in a M/L and it fit but was tight so I wear that one to go out at night and I got the grey one in L/XL which is more comfortable for daytime. For reference I'm 5'5 155lbs and usually wear 8-10 in dressed and a Large. These feel very soft and look great on! They do hug your body but that's what I like about them. The length is perfect... I'm ordering more colors!


I ordered this in a size large based on the reviews and I'm so glad I did. It's a very soft comfortable fit and hits me below the calf muscle which I love. I am a 36b, 29w, 38h.


Very cute dress, got a little stomach so that's a problem haha other then that, it's great!


Talk about a dress with versatility! I bought this dress in black and it has served me well for the three times that I wore it. It is form fitting, but not to the point where it looks "cheap" or "trashy". I have worn this dress with heels, tall gladiator sandals and my Nike tennis shoes. I just purchased it again in gray...but now I think I will take a blue too.


For the price, the quality is good. If you are looking for a solid piece that is functional, you cannot go wrong with this purchase.
