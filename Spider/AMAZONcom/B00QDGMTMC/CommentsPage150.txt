Love love love this dress


I'm 5ft 90 something pounds lol it fits well I got a XS I received it early I really love it so much


I loved the way the dress fit me and hugged all of my curves. And the black is really nice because it makes u look slimmer. And I really felt that wa . And everyone lover the dress.


This fits as expected, quality seems good, but the color is very different from the picture.  What I received is much more green.


Love it


It looks good but I don't understand you sent it the same items,


I wasn't really happy with the dress but I needed it for a last minute dinner party.


I was gonna return it but I had nothin else to wear.


did not like it, ok as a around the house dress.


I used this dress for my baby shower and loved how it made me look. Very stretchy.


I love it
