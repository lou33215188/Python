I love shows off my curves..Made me feel FABULOUS. .


the color was wrong; instead of grey its army green


I am a 16 and the 2X fits like a L.


PERFECT! Going to buy 4 more but most of all I love the quality and the PRICE.


I absolutely love this dress. I needed a simple inexpensive black dress, so I took a chance on this for several reasons. I have a very specific body type, extremely hourglass and verrry top heavy, so dresses without zippers and a bit of slinky stretch always look best. This is definitely slinky and stretchy in a very flattering way. The material is just my favorite, it's like the material of that amazing t shirt you have that's super soft and never changes when you wash it. I don't find it too thin at all, or see through. The neckline is not too high, which I was also concerned about. It hits me perfectly on the neckline and right under my knee, and I am 5'4 about 140 lbs. It does show your body and all its "imperfections" but in a flattering way, especially in the black color. I think the cut and feel of it is very classy and can be worn for many, many different occasions. The only flaw I can find is that the material can have a shine to it where it stretches tightly, but only in direct light. I would attribute that to the poly-blend material (it's a twenty dollar dress). I would assume that means it's best not to put it in the dryer. Haven't washed it yet, but I will probably thought in the wash and then hang dry. Love, love, love this dress. Will love it through the seasons!


Thin material.


Ordered this for my daughter who wears small and fit as expected


No this dress did not meet my expectations.  I expected a thicker material so. I was extremely disappointed.


My niece looked amazing in this dress for her college graduation


Very nice. Sexy but classy look ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼
