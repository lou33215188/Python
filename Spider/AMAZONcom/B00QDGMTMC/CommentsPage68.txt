Material is thin but very nice color and sexy fit .


Love it will where it christmas day


5'8" 135lbs, athletic built - got a small and it fits very perfectly. Love it! Quality soft material, comfy, much softer than some other toms dresses, probably a bit thin and not as forgiving on fat days when my stomach isn't flat. Would buy again.


Like all Tom's products I love this dress. The quality is nice and it fits like I expected. Great buy


Love it. I am 5'1 and I thought it would not be a midi on me. But it is beautiful and perfect midi. I love the soft cool material. Only thing I don't like is that it has to be washed by hand. But it is worth it.


The dress is pretty but the material is to thin and light. Thinner than a cotton beach maxi dress. I just don't think its good for a formal occassion. Cute to run errands in but I really bought it for a formal setting.


Great dress...fits nice.  The color was very pretty and it fit my curves nicely!


Love it. Perfect fit. I want more dresses from Toms. Now i got to be creative and dress it up.


Thought it was the same material as the long sleeve midi by Tom Ware..very thin material..sleeveless more like a t-shirt dress than the picture implies..thought I could wear as dressy dress with heels..not the case...three stars because fit was great and arrived quickly


I was impressed by how early the package arrived. I was not impressed by the quality of the material, the fabric. I was hoping the fabric would be much thicker. It was like a t-shirt material.
