hugs my body perfectly


This dress is a beautiful material, but they need to make it in larger sizes.  I normally wear XL or 1x.  I ordered an XL & its way to fitted for church or business.  I wanted it for casual wear with sheer top, but its to small even with jacket on.  PLEASE START OFFERING THIS DRESS IN LARGER SIZES!!!  I will get 1 in each color even for a few dollars more.


I am loving this dress.  The fabric is very soft and the dress fits perfectly.  I will be ordering the other colors because this dress is perfect for dressing up or down.


It was a little shorter than I would have liked but it's a nice dress.


Its fairly form fitting.  Fabric is a little sea through and way too thin for my liking.  I was hoping to wear it for professional situations but Id be too embarrassed.  Returning.


I love this dress. I bought four of them. You'll need a slip or spanx for underneath as you can see all garment lines. I am 5'5" and 130# and a medium is perfect.


I love this dress! The material is flatteringly thick and opaque. The length is conservative, but the fit makes the dress a little more special. Suitable to dress up for an event, or to dress down for daily wear. I intend to purchase other colors.


I love the way this dress fits and stretchable fabric really makes a nice impression.


Nice material but a little thin


love it. stretchy and comfy
