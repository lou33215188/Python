This dress is great, although a tad thin in the fabric, (have another one much thicker) it still does the trick.  If you wear your good shapewear to accentuate those curves you will be fine. I purchased two of them;. Great buy!


I ordered the black one M size and returning It. It runs small and thin material, the price and quality does not match. Disappointed!


The size is good and I received lots of compliments on the color...


Perfect very simple but sexy


Cute but buy 2 sizes up if you don't want it to be skin tight.


Nice dress. T-shirt material. Dress up or down. True to size.


I love the fit.  I read the reviews and went one size up.  I'm usually a S and ordered a M (which is a US size S).  It fit as expected. It hugs every curve of your body.  The material is a soft knit which feel nice against the skin.  As other reviews have stated, you can see underwear lines.  So, keep that in mind.  I loved the dress!


Great fit if you wear a large buy medium for sexy fit.


I like it though the fabric is not what I was expecting. It's like a t-shirt. It is not for bodies with lumps and bumps the fabric is not forgiving.


I Love these dresses.
