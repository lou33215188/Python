i love itğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�  im 5'3 i had a baby 7 months ago and i have 170 pounds  a medium/large its perfect for me


Looking for a dress for work, I ordered the gray color. Shipping was super quick, and quality was very nice. The fabric is sooooo soft I just love it! It was a bit on the revealing side though. I am 5'8" 140lbs, not super curvy but I've got my bumps in places I'd rather the world didn't know about. This dress really show cases every nook and cranny and leaves nothing to the imagination. (I ordered the medium/large btw) I am trying again in the burgundy of the large/x large with hopes that it will not cling like a wet t shirt and will be a bit more work appropriate.


Update! Received an XL which still shows too much for work, but would be perfect for going out on the town. I then ordered a double XL which is not as flattering on top, but looks beautiful around the hips. Paired with a blazer it is exactly what I need for work and am loving it!


Pretty sexy dress but beware.  If you don't use some sort of shapeware, you're going to have problems!  I don't care if you're a size 2 or 32, get some shapeware!  This dress will cling to any and every bit of a pudge, wrinkle and/or cellulite.  Like I said, the dress is sexy, but it's also evil!  :p  Once you get that out of the way, you will enjoy wearing this.  I'm 5'8" 143 and the L/XL worked for me, mainly because I wanted a little extra room.  The quality isn't the best and this dress will no doubt pill after 2-3 washes.  But considering the price, it's not bad.


The dress is pretty and all but I got this specifically for my baby shower and due to the material I can't wear it. I got the coral (pink). I'm 7 months pregnant and it does stretch nicely over my bump without being constricting. BUT no matter what I wear under it it is completely visible.  I also have tattoos that are visible through this material as well, but that may be because my belly is stretching the dress against me. I'm going to keep the dress and either find a long sweater to wear with it or wait until post pregnancy when I can wear a tight dress slip. I will figure something out...


Description says cotton (and various fibers blend) Tag says 65 poly and 35 rayon. It was also sold as a M/L which means it should fit on the smaller scale of the Large. The tag is labeled L (large only). Most of my dresses are Medium and or Large depending on the name brand/cut. I expected this to be fitted. BUT this is beyond fitted. When looking at the dress hanging it's definitely not considered large. My friend who is a small size fit tried it on and it barely fit her.


I would have returned but due to the holiday rush didn't see any of the issues till I tried to wear it for a holiday party out of town. I was disappointed to find it didn't fit at all. I was gone on extended holiday trip and not able to send back before the expiration window was no longer valid. If anything an amazon store credit would have been helpful.


This was perfect! I am a US6 and ordered Small/Medium in teal, color is true to pictures. Material is excellent and didn't feel cheap. It was one of my best purchases on amazon. (Even nicer than the other Tom's Ware dresses I bought) I will definitely get them in other colors as well.


I love it. It fits well the material isn't see through. Its better than I expected.


I love this dress! I will tell you it does run small though. I own this is 2 other colors as well. I typically wear a 2/4 in dresses or xsmall to small depending on the brand. My measurements are 32ddd x 25 x 36. I bought this in the xs and also the small. The small fit the best and I do like dresses a bit clingy. The fabric is so comfy and it looks really classy on. I'm 5'6" and this comes just over my knees.


******UPDATE********


I decided to purchase the same dress over a year later since I loved it so much. I got three colors during the prime day sale. The three dresses I received were not the same as the quality dress I ordered a year ago. The fabric is much cheaper quality now. It's not as soft nor is it as stretchy as my other dresses from a year ago. I'm really disappointed because I love this dress and it such a great staple item.


Love it
