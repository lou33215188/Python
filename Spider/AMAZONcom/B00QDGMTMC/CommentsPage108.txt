Happy with my dress


Wonderful fit, I would buy more.


Size up. I'm 5'6", 165. I got XL and it fit great. I'm usually a 12 or large sometimes XL so runs slightly small. looks good bunched up at the waist like a top too.


I got so many compliments on this dress. it did what i needed it to do and it fit amazingly. Now be weary it is a stretch fabric therefore it fits tight and hugs every part of your body, but doesn't strangle you. It is kind of thin fabric, so it's breathable. I definitely am planning to buy a few more in different colors!!


I like this dress.  It's a good shape and the fabric feels soft.  However, I think it's going to require some serious shapewear underneath.  It's really stretchy and thin fabric.  It shows everything.  It will be a fun dress but not for work.


Dress fit perfect, not too tight... I'm 166 pounds and I ordered a XL because I didnt want it to fit too tight... The size I got was perfect


Fits great, good quality cotton! no complaints


The material is great and it fits perfect! For the price I was expecting it to be horrible but the dress is  great. I'll be getting a few more in different colors just to have on hand.

This dress fits great. Smooth and soft material. Very cool in the summer.
