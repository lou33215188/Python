The material is very thin but it still fit well. I'm 5'7 and normally wear a size 14 so I bought a L/XL and it fit perfectly. Wore it to a wedding.


Great fit, nice color, an overall nice dress. I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars because it smelled so gross when I took it out of the package. It smelled like it had been in a musty warehouse before they shipped it. I washed it twice before wearing.


i am a 16-18.  ordered in plum.  love this dress.  will order more colors.  i usually wear a slip or other garment underneath as the dress is a little see through (underwear)


Cute on a curvy girl. I'm 5'1, size 16/18w and some kinda thick. Wearing a xl-2xl. It's hugging me honey!


It's very fitted, especially if you're curvy, but everytime I wear this dress. I get lots of compliments!


I'm 4'10 & 130 lbs - curvy in the right places. It's something you can wear to work with a jacket and look professional & wear out on a date/wedding.


In Love with the color. This Dress fits perfectly. I received so many complements.


Though the material is fine, if you have a slim body this fits well. More of a dinner/casual dress than anything else. I recommend this for quick friendly or family outings (causal).


fit better than expected. Color is great and the fabric is thick enough to not be transparent, but thin enough to be comfortable when it's warmer. Length is a bit long, but I'm not too bothered by that. Pair with a half sleeve cardigan for work or a night out


This dress is a bit see through when stretched out. The dress molds to the body perfectly, the only reason I returned it is because it is thin and shows all imperfections.


Too tight but that may be my fault...lol  Going to the gym now.
