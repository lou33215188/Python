This is a t-shirt not a dress one can wear to a party. Disappointing. I usually get such great stuff on Amazon but I would be embarrassed to wear this dress in public. I can see no functional occasion to wear it and will send it back.


Perfect color and fit


Love this dress!

im 5 7 and 135. i got this dress in a small and the fit was out of this world. It sexy but classy not too revealing but hugs your assy lol I got it in green and partnered it with a blazer. My bf couldn't keep his eyes of me


I wasn't sure about this dress when I took it out of the package-- thought the fabric seemed a little too thin. However, it fits like a dream! Ends under my knees (I'm 5'4) and clings to all the curves I want to show off while concealing little problem areas. Looks great with some high heels, and a statement necklace. Would recommend wearing a seamless panty or shaper because panty lines do show a little bit, but not enough to be a big deal. Perfect little black dress!


I really like the dress, but be warned it is very form fitting... I had to stand up straight , and make sure I kept my stomach sucked in... because it shows all your curves good and bad... wear the correct under garment too... I would purchase the gress again in other colors too


Great fit and color
