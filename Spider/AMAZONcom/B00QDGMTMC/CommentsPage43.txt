Not flattering at all, picks up every imperfection on your body. I immediately returned


I love this. I am going to order more of this brand. I went a size up because I am 20 weeks pregnant and there is enough stretch for my growing belly. It is going to be the perfect dress for me to wear now and later.


I really love it I bought 2 different colors its amazing go for it


Too too cute!!!!!


I'm in love with this dress. Very comfortable, great quality and very flattering.


Please order one size up because this dress comes in Asian sizes. It is very comfortable yet super chic. It can be dressed up for evening wear or worn as a day dress. I love it!


This maxi skirt was an awesome deal. It felt like wearing pjs all day plus I got lots of compliments on it. I'm planning on buying it in a couple more colors & patterns! :)


The dress is a very nice dark gray and its relatively stretchy/fabric holds its shape after stretching.


The size is a little too small for XL, I recently lost 45 and am between L and M, I am glad I ordered the XL after looking at the sizing... this is definitely a smallish L, not an XL. :)


With that said, I love it its beautiful and is easy to ware from school to office to out (a little accessory, and a sexier shoe makes this dress hot actually!:)


I love this dress. I bought spanks to go under it because I knew it wouldn't be forgiving and I'm very glad I did. The dress, with the spanks, hugs all my curves and makes me look wonderful. Huge confidence booster.


Love this color, good fit and easy to put on if you're too lazy to dress up.


Very nice for the price. Fits great.
