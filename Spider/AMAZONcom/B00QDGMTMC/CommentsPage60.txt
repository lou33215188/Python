I went up a size, because I didn't want it too tight.  It stil clung to my body, as expected, but not so much that the fabric became see thru.  I really like this dress, made well. I'm going to buy a few more in other colors l. Can't beat the price


This dress is comfortable and fits well. It does hug your curves, so if you do not prefer this, go up a size.


Buy this! So sexy. Get more than one color. Order a size up for comfort because it's kinda thin.


Absolutely love the fit and style


After reading other reviews I ordered this dress. I'm a bit of a toothpick 5'6, 117, and bought a medium. It's pretty but snug. Also needs a slip which will show because of how snug the dress is.


This is by all means one of my favorite dress. I wear it on a date with my husband, on a nice summer day, out to the club with the girls. Its the perfect dress. The charcoal grey is so pretty and it hugs every curve. I wear a smooth body shaper underneath to keep everything in tack so you wont see the lump and bumps. I am 5'5 and shapely (breast, hips, and back side) and it looked GORG on. Must buy.


It literally looks amazing and the fabric is soft! I recommend if you get the wrong size just contact the seller instead of making negative reviews because they made me very hesitant on if I wanted to buy it or not, but now I'm very happy that I did


This dress is great for work with a blazer and heels or casual day. It can easily transform from day to night! It's a classic piece at a great price! I plan to purchase different colors! For now the navy is perfect!


This dress is so cuteeeee and considering the price, the material is perfect!! It hugs your curves and its very comfy because the material is soft and stretchy. Can't believe i paid this little for a gorgeous dress! Normally you pay at least $60 for a nice dress from Norstrom, Macy's, or Bebe.


Wow does my wife look good in this!!! Very classy and sexy all at the same time.
