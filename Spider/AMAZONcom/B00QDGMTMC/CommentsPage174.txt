Clingy


True to size wonderful fit


I was extremely pleased with this purchase. I didn't expect to get the quality garment that I received. I was pleasantly surprised!


Fabric thin and length in leg too short.


I love this company and dress! It fits perfect and is not too thin! For a perfect price.


Love this dress and it fit like a glove. Very sexy


Very thin, shows absolutely everything, would require at least a slip to wear out. Fabric is soft but, like I said, very thin.


My wife bought this dress and very sad because of its poor quality.  Her comment was, I would have read the reviews. Returning item.


It fits perfectly. I thought it would be to big because I ordered a XL but I love the way it looks


Order one size up. Got med/lrg. I'm 5'3" 160 lbs & too small
