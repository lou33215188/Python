This is a cute body-hugging knit dress that needs a foundational  layer between you and the dress. It is so clingy throughout the hips and pelvic region that the dress loses it's classic look without undergarments.


This dress fit great, arrived quite quickly even from China, and I love the comfortable stretchy material. I think it's a great buy and am currently exploring getting other colours. It fit as expected since I went a size up. My measurements are 35, 28, 39 and I weigh around 150 pounds. I got the medium and it fit close but not too close. It really is a great buy... the charcoal at least.


I love it! It's a great dress and the color looks very classy. Good for business causal wear. Does fit tightly.


Spandex material, but not too thin...breathable material.


BEAUTIFUL COLOR, NICE MATERIAL


Very fitted and stretchy, clingy fabric but looks good, LOVE IT


I really love this dress. It is a beautiful a color and I wore with a kimono cardigan and I received a lot of compliments. Definitely a dress that is fitted but comfy a swell


Finnally I received dress that is untill knees as it says in description. Usually it runs too small. Dress is very elastic and compliments body perfectly. Only thing I wish that material is little bit thicker coz cellulite is kinda visible even thou its RED dress. But thats my problem lol Very sexy and elegant dress. Recommend it!!!


the fit runs small


Love the fit! Just wished the material looked less cotton like for the office, but I like it nonetheless. Very flattering.
