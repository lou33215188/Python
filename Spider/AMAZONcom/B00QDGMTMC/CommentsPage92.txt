Skin tight. Ordered my normal size, showed every line.


Fits nicely got it in med size fits ok but think will get a small next tym cos I lost a little baby weight......very stretchy.......


too small...but love the color, you have to have a perfect body to wear this.....or a shaper for sure


There is not much to this dress. Buy a spandex body suit and you will be better off.


Great color and fit - I love it!


Great quality as pictured. When washed the material gets EXTREMELY wrinkled and has to be pressed.


Love it! Very light weight.


Great color. The dress tag says xs the other tag says s. It fits like  xs. I'm 5'9 123 , 34/24/34 it hits 3inch above the knee. You can probably get the same quality dress for that price at h&m in the basics section. I like it.


I bought this on my husband's account. First in black and then I loved it so much I bought it in gray too. Very comfortable well fitting dress. Fabric is a bit thin but not see through at all. Great for spring summer or fall.  You can dress it up or dress or down.


5'1, 180 lbs, ordered XL. It fit as expected, very curve-hugging but the material is very thin as everyone has said. Now looking for a printed kimono cardigan to wear with it and it will be perfect. Good buy.
