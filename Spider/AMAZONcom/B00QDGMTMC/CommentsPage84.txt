Loved the material and length. Not sheer and super soft.  Thought the L/XL would be a comfortable fit but when I received the dress, the tag read XL and it wasn't as fitted as I expected. Color was rich and the length was perfect for dinner.


The Best. So cute So sexy. Fits so nuce on my curves!


The idea of the dress was SO lovely. I really wanted to make the dress work. It was too clingy, however. To clingy on the tummy area (other Tom's Ware dresses are thicker so I can get away with wearing them) and you can totally see underwear through them. If you have a flat tummy, it might work better for you. Shame.


Its a winner. I love this dress. All the postive reviews are on point...


I loved it. Just make sure you wear the right under garments if you are curvy.


I absolutely love the dress. The only thing is I had to return it because it had a little tear in the bust. I am reordering in hopes of receiving one without rips, holes, or tears.


I am about 205 in weight and i bought the us xl / xxl and i felt i could have taken a size smaller. It is a very stretchy thin material so a smaller size will work great


I bought a size larger and it was tight. Material isn't too thin. I wash and hang dry this dress so it won't shrink.


This is a good looking casual dress. I recommend you wear a body tight spaghetti strap under garment underneath it.


Nice quality for price. Runs small. I'm 5' 10" and it reaches my knees (which is good). Perfect for work, I add a cardigan.
