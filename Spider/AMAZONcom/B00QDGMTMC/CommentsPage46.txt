beautiful


This is a very nice dress and it fits as expected, It does have a slight sheen to it from the lycra/spandax material but it is not overwhelmingly shiny. I plan to wear it this fall with log sleeves or a turtle neck.


I have purchased this dress twice in two different sizes for other people as gifts, I am confident they will enjoy them


This dress is amazing and comfortable.


Cute, inexpensive, but very form fitting and doesn't hide a curve


Im 5' 7" and 150 pnds, 41 inch bum, 31 inch waist, 36C in Bras. Got a medium in purple. Already had a one in red. Amazing quality. Will be getting more.


Love it all of the dresses that I've order from Tom Ware are just awesome very good company.


Fits as expected.  Beautiful material with a little stretch. Love it!!


I ordered a 2X Lg and it fits nicely. However I normally wear a Lg. Il like the feeling of the material. The length is just right, I'm keeping both dresses. Thank you for bringing this classic look back. I Love the feminine look.


Love this dress as a base layering piece, and everything you can do with it in terms of layering. I would definitely suggest going a size-up, even if you plan on wearing it without layers.
