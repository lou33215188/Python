Love the fit, only issue is that you need a slip under it.


so many compliments. Sexy little dress


Fit and looks good.


Was not the color shown on the pic and had a line going thru it, am really vexed. Would have given it zero stars .


It's lovelyğŸ˜� and it fits as expected, my boyfriend got it for me and I absolutely love it, I'm size small and I would recommend it to anyoneğŸ‘�


Simple sexy dress


Love it, sexy and professional! Buying more


This dress is so cute and fits perfect! I reordered it in three more colors!


after weAring it a short time the dress stretched out to be unappealing and way too big.


Gorgeous.  Will wear with tights/leggings.  Not the most forgiving fabric (a little thin) but it stretches and you can totally work it.
