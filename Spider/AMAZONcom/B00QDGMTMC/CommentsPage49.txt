The fabric is absolutely amazing so soft yet you know its durable I've worn this a few times already and I love it so comfortable and you don't look like you're too dressed up or casual. Dress it up or down.


This is an attention getter. I paired it with a nice jewelry set and it just Wowed others. I did however, feel it was over priced being that I went to my local mall and found almost this exact dress for half the price!


My niece it's going to love it


Order up!  This dress runs small.  I ordered a large and am 5' 8" and 120 and it is fitted.


Too small


The material isn't as think as I had hoped for, but the fit is just right!  the length is perfect...fits below the knee.  I am glad I purchased this product.  I will get more colors!!


This dress is more of a bodycon dress than I expected, but the fit was perfect and the fabric is good quality. I bought in in burgundy and am thinking of buying more in other colors. Absolutely love this!


I'm 5'6 and the general fit of the dress was fine but it hugged me in all the wrong places. Not flattering at all. Quality was as expected.


I do really like this dress! Fits as expected, super stretchy material (I only wish it showed more back, but hey, it's still a super classy dress). My one and only gripe is that it is really shiny material, and when flashed with a camera it's super obvious. It is very cute when dressed up with shoes and a belt.


Beautiful color in person, very sexy fit, shows off my figure. It fits a little snug so I suggest getting a size up, and the material is thin, so wear appropriate undergarments. I will be ordering more
