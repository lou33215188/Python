Thin dress, nice and airy for a simple event so this is not for a formal event work or anything like that just for a chill vibe with fam and friends.


This dress was PERFECT in every way! The length, the material, the color...sheer perfection a must haveğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾


My new favorite dress. Fits curves perfectly. Stretchy material. Love it.


Beautiful dress, very simple and elegant. Would def buy it again in another color.


Way too small and I am 5' 4" and 120 pounds and bought a small. It was skin tight in the stomach area, so unless you have a model flat stomach expect it to show the tinest bit of fat on a skinny person. Im not sure if spanks would work either.  I ended up returning it.


I really likes this one.


Material in thinner, but length is classy and neck is just fine. Great for work or going out.


Sexy, classy, and comfortable


The material is thicker than expected. But it just a normal jersey material dress, that shows out your figure. Three stars because the price is to high.


Spandex and form fitting


I ordered 3 and they all fit differently..


Sad..
