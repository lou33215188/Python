Shipped on time, and it's the right length. I'm 5'7", and it's just above the knee. I ordered a small. It's just super tight, and if you get a lighter color it will most likely be a bit see-through.


This is a cute dress. Not the best material. Not a true midi. Would be cute for someone petite. I have a athletic build, 5'9, 185. And it was too short. I ordered a M/L


Looks good but runs small


This fits like a second skin! Great stretch fabric. Good for the price too.  Definitely not for the workplace, but a perfect fit for a night out. Ladies, you'll need a bodyguard! lol


This dress is amazing! Wore it on my cruise to the captains dinner, purchased the black and gray. i will be ordering more.


Excellent dress for the money. I am using it as a maternity dress.


Love the dresses, I bought 2 colors, they fit real sexy, following my curve nicely. I'm 5'2"/ 115. Nice material, not too thick (makes you look bulky) and not thin either. Good buy for the price.


Comfy material, but it's so small and see through.


like it


Now I know XL is  for a medium sized person. Be guided by the sizes
