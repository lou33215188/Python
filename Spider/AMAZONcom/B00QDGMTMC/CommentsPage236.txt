Awesome lil dress, very casual and very comfortable!


Great clothing fit prefect will order again great  material.


Im 5'3, 123lbs, 34-24-38 bit chunky on the bottom and a Small/Medium was a perfect fit.


Love this dress. I ended up buying it in blue as well.


Too long! :( bought this for valentine's day. Pretty thin and way to long for a woman who is 5'3. Should have picked something else up from a store near by.


I love this dress (and so does my boyfriend ğŸ˜‰)


So cute! I'm love it. Very simple material and extremely stretchy. The burgundy/plum color is right on!


Love this dress, will get more colors!!! And it was the perfect size.


This is an excellent, sexy classy but simple dress. It is for day, night and evening. It can be dressed up with a nice necklace. You must have the right figure to wear it - it shows every inch of a good body. Rolls will not look good in this dress.


It was like a men's shirt, and a weird color.
