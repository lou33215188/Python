loved the color.. didn't like how thin it was.. shows every little thing.. lol.. and i'm small! high neckline wasn't too attractive either. i sent it back.


I love the silky soft material of the dress and he color is beautiful. It is quite tight I ordered the medium and it hugs my body quite snug. It hits below my knee making this dress sexy and sophisticated


Love the fit and love the feel.  I am tall so I love that it is just the right lenght for me.


This dress fits PERFECTLY!!! Im 5"8 168 pounds. I ordered a  small (I normally wear a medium in dresses).  I'm definitely going to order more of these in a different color.


Mertieal is okay but medium is too tight


Nice dress


Order a size up. Other than that this is a beautiful dress. Love the green color and the material.


Well it does stretch ,fit better then I expected


This dress fits better than I expected and I love the length!


Perfect!!!!!
