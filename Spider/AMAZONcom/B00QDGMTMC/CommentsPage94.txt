Love it


Love the material...very comfortable and not thin!


Fits good material thin but light weight gave 3 stars since I haven't worn or washed it yet but like it for far


This dress is very sheer but is okay if you have shapewear or undergarments that are nude or black (skintone specific).


Love this dress will always buy from this seller great quality


Absolutely love dress. Bought 2XL. I'm 5'10" and wear size 14 normally and bought. Great fit and soft material. Will continue to buy more Tom ware clothes. Very happy!


Love this dress! It's perfect for the spring/summer time!


Slightly flimsy but not see through (I don't think...lol)


This dress is very close fitted and you need to wear a seamless panty otherwise it will print.


Fits really nice, I have received many compliments and I love how it looks.
