Perfect


Love this dress! I'm very petite 5 ft. and 95 lbs (ordered XS) so I was expecting to have to get this altered in some way, but it fits like a glove! the length is great and the material is better than expected, it's very soft not see through, has some thickness to it. Will be ordering more colors :) only thing is I recommend wearing spanx under it or seamless underwear as the material will show any bumps or lines.

Very thin, you might need to wear something under.
