I'm 5 months pregnant and this dress fit me well even if a belly. The material is very stretchy, but quality is in line with the price. Keeps me from spending a lot on maternity dresses.


This dress can be dressed up or down. Do be aware that you must be selective in your underwear choice because lines are visible. Other than this, great purchase for the price.


nice color but its a bit tighter than i thought it'd be


Fits well, material is on the thin side - but I expected that. Works Good for a basic dress to go under a dress jacket for the office, or to dinner.


Great dress but I ended up fining something better at Macy's and returned it. Would wear it though but didn't need to waste money according to the husband lol


Nice dress the material isn't to thin and it hugs your body nice. This is my 2nd dress from this company and its because how the dress fits my curves that made me come back.


The material is WAY lighter than I anticipated, was thinking I could wear to work with a blazer perhaps.  Uhm, no.  It's also tighter than I anticipated it would be. Date appropriate, but too fitted for work.


OMG!! I LOVE THIS DRESS! I AM NOT A SMALL  WOMAN AND IT'S HARD TO FEEL SEXY THESE DAYS BUT I FEEL VERY SEXY IN THIS DRESS!! GOING TO BUY EVERY COLOR!!!


I have three of these in a different color. It is the most comfortable dress I own, but it is not forgiving on any "extra" weight / shape  on your body.


SEE THROUGH!!! Even with an under dress you can see EVERYTHING! There is no way I would wear this out in public. You can see every detail of your underwear, bra, slip, everything for the world to see. Might as well just wear a clear dress.
