Great!  Love it, cant wait to wear.


the material is very thin but its a nice dress and it looks like the picture. I loved it


It was to large for my daughter but a perfect fit for my daughter in law so it worked out.


Love it! Looks more sage or olive-grey then the grey in the photo.


very sexy but too tight.... but this is my mistake..... thats why 5 star


very nice


This dress hugs every curve. I love it


Best purchase I've made in a while. Fits great and material is soft yet thick. I do need to wear a light spanx under just to conceal pantyline. I am 5'9" and length is just above my knee.


This dress is very nice!  It's tight, but comfortable tight because the material is soft and thin.  I wore to a wedding and felt very comfortable all night.  I recommend this dress and the price is great.


Thinner than expected, shoulders are tank like not thick. I'm keeping it only because I need it this weekend otherwise I would have returned.
