Ok but is a large not a medium large and does not runs small.  Terrible packaging.  Huge box for a dress.


I love these dresses.  I have them in several colors.


Size was as expected but the fabric is very see through.


Fits perfect and stretches with my curves. I purchased it 4 my black and white masquerade bday party...so i might end up making a white waist belt


it fits true to size. Fast shipping and looked great on me


Bad bad cuality


It is lovely.it looks exactly how the picture looks. The fit is flattering and it accentuates curves. I love the lightweight material.


The quality is nice! Love the color and love how it fits!! No complains here!!


Good price for simple dress. Nice fit


This is right for my size but I wanted it for work and I think even going many sizes larger wouldn't help. It's VERY tight.
