I bought these for my daughter's who absolutely love them. They are much more form fitting than they thought they would be but as both are very slim they aren't concerned. These are so versatile that they have worn them multiple times with different looks and are having fun thinking up other great outfits with them. True foundational dress.


Love this simple black dress that can be dressed up or dressed down.


I love this dress! It can be dressed up or down and in my opinion, worn year-round! I got it in blush pink, charcoal and grey.


This dress fits me perfectly. I don't know my measurements but I am the same size and shape as Dutchess from the reality show Black Ink except my breast are way bigger. 32DDD to be exact. I purchased a medium. I hope this helps.


I absolutely love it! Hugs the curves well.  I got plenty of compliments when I wore it. Threw on some jewelry, heels, and a blazer... It was a great day in the life of a saleswoman!


Fits perfect! Not too short. The material is about a medium as far as thickness. I get complements every time I wear it.


Comfortable with good stretch and great color


Love the dress & great material soft and comfortable. True to size.


This is a very nice dress.  I bought it in the green and I am happy about the purchase.  However, I tried buying the same dress from Toms Ware in the red and see the shipping is $15.63 which is very high for a small flat package.  Interesting, the blue, gray and some other colors do not have shipping charges.  Please tell why this is the case?


I though this was t shirt material but itâ€™s ok
