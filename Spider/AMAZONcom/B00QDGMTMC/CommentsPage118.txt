Truly in love with this dress. Already have the charcoal and black. Now I'm eyeballing the green dress. Definitely a must buy!

Love this dress. It looks good on me and looks more expensive than it actually is. Great buy from an excellent company.


Nice dress, just not for me.  I'm older and need fabric that will provide more shape/support.


Suggest wearing darker undergarments as the fabric becomes a bit see through as its stretched. Very soft and cozy though!


I'm in love with this simply sexy dress ! It's a little in the thin side , so you can see through it . But pair it with sexy undies and it's fantastic !!!
