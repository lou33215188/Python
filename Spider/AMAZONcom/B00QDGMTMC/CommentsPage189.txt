Great looking dress im 5'4 and it fits me like a midi which is what I wanted so I will order more colors bc its a great dress


Fits amazing


fits ok but see-through be mindful of that clings to the body


I bought this dress one size larger per the reviews. It fits perfectly.


Sexy.. fits close so depending on what you want you may wish to order a size up.


The dress is cute, but its made like a long fitted T-shirt, so wash it on delicate or its going to shrink, lose its shape and get lint balls all over it, its very thin, so of course it fits like a glove to anyone and everything,  if you decide to wear or not to wear underwear, everyone will know, I got the Burgandy one and you can still see, so go black


It is very transparent look around


I loveeeeee it! It is fitting and accents my bodyy perfectly


Light weight, cozy, comfortable, sexy.  I'd by more in other colors!


I love it bc it fits very well, but is not appropriate for work. I had to buy a slip to wear under because its a little see through.
