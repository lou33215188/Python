Wife looks great in it.


Love this dress!!! I'm 5' 2" 150lbs and it fits perfectly!! It can be worn to work with a blazer for a professional look, or worn for a night out with my girls with some added accessories. I love how soft the material is as well. I was worried it was going to be shear but no it's just perfect.


Comfy and soft. I usually wear a small. I ordered a S/M and it is super tight.


Nice fabric, a little thinner than I hoped but for the price, it is a nice dress.  Runs WAAAAY small.  I am normally a size 4 in dresses (5'5", athletic 130 lbs) and I got the small/medium and it is skin tight.  I am going to have to return for medium/large and hope for the best.


Perfect little black dress. Classy enough to wear to the office, casual and cute with some heels or even flip flops! I will buy again.


Just received my dress and it fits perfect!! If you're somewhat in shape or in shape this dress will compliment your figure.  The material it's made from makes the dress show every curve with it still being a casual look coming down to knee length.


The size is correct but the material makes the fit clingy and tighter than my expectations.


This fits very well. It hugs in all the right places. It is well made and the length is great.


Cute dress slim fit to curves. but still respectful look. Loved it. Ordered 5 for my ladies to wear to our company event. We put our logo on the left chest. loved it


Terrible quality, super tight and nothing I could\would ever wear to work.
