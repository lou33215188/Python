So comfy!


The shipping was quick and the product was true to description. I cant wait to wear to my brothers wedding in addition to a few accessories.


Material is a bit thin. Dress is a little see through and fits snall.


Great fit, great material. Wanted to wear it to work but a bit too tight. Length is great...will buy a size up next time


So comfortable.


I love this dress!  I will hug every curve on your body and the length to perfect if your trying to be classy and sexy at the same time.


nice fitted dress


I love it if it's comfortable and it's soft.almost feel like if I have nothing on


lovely midi stretchy dress.  I bought a few more and I wear a size 22 dress (very busty) with small hips


The color is way off-not even close to gray!!
