This dress fits like A dream and is so comfortable! I would highly recommend it.

My dress fit perfectly. I'm 5'6 and 190 pds. I'm very curvaceous and it fit like a glove. I ordered an XL. I wore it out on my 33rd bday and received a ton of compliments and even a marriage proposal. I liked it so much that I ordered it in red too!!!


I absolutely love this dress!!! It's so versatile and fits my curves.  The price makes it so worth it!
