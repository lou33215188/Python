Beautiful color (red), very soft fabric, and fits my curves nicely. I am 5'7", 135 lbs and ordered the Small/Medium. I will definitely buy in other colors. What I like about it is that it's versatile: the fabric means you can wear it on a summer day with some sandals or dress it up with some heels to make it a little more elegant/sexy.


i could not fit it


it was to small so i gave itg to a friemd who love it


love the look and style of this dress. Fits perfectly


I can wear this in the summer with sandals or in the winter with boots and a sweater.  The material is stretchy and forgiving.I love it!


it hugs you but it's not too tight. i'm 5'5", 145lbs and it hits me right below my knees. it's one of my favorite summer dresses.


Love love love this skirt! BUT after wearing 2 times  the fabric started rolling up as if it was snagged or something. I will try rolling a lint roller over it to see if that helps but if not I wouldn't but again.


My man loves these dresses on me


I think this Piece is both classy and sexy . I purchase it in the green color for fall . The fabric is a bit thin so I would recommend a body shaper underneath  and to go up a size.


Very nice dress and fits like a glove. Super soft material and very comfy.


Purchased this dress in 3 colors. This dress is so sexy!
