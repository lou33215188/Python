I am 5'4 198 lbs. Fit better than expected.  VERY comfortable! Love the length on it. ordered the charcoal grey color too.. If your concerned with the curve hugging shape, wear a cardigan, blazer or shirt over it as I am. Hope this helps... Happy shopping!


This is a great feel.  The fabric is soft and very light -- bought several basic colors to build a work wardrobe, and I am extremely happy with this purchase.  I ordered a size up and  a good undergarment is needed if you are like me and have curves for a flawless professional look.


I like the dress.  I read the reviews and ordered accordingly. i'm 5'8 about 185 give or take (more like give an extra 5 pounds).  It's very stretchy and I like that.  It is somewhat thin but for the price I'm pleased.


Body hugging for sure


Looks great on


Stretches to almost any size


Love it

Too tight and see through. Such thin material!


The color is not as bright as the picture, and it’s verrryyyyyyy  tight , so either you need a perfect body for it or very good spanx cause this dress is t very forgiving.


Just got mine today. It is the best! I love the material it's thick enough the length is good enough for me. The colour is more of a brighter green than the shade of green shown. But satisfied overall will defiantly be ordering more from this supplier. Thank you.


Love it!


Form fitting. Thick, soft, quality material. I am 5’3”, 148lbs, size 6 women’s dresses & pants.


Gorgeous on and shows every curve but not see through.  You need spanks but so flattering and great material!  The green is stunning!
