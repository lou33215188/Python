It fits good!


I purchased 2, the burgundy and the blue. The colors pop and are very pretty. The fabric is soooo comfortable and it hits right at the end of the knee giving a perfect midi elegant/sophisticated look. I'm 5'1,118 lbs and I bought the XS/S. If you have a bit of a tummy this fabric does well in hiding it if you suck in since it's stretchy. Fast shipping, I recommend this dress.


Love this. Will be ordering more in different colors soon


loved the way it shows off the curves of they body


I love it thank you so much


It is a great dress, but just be sure that you are OK with it revealing everything! Underwear, bra...everything! Very soft, but clingy material. I brought this for Christmas party and made sure I wore a trench coat over it and the lighting was dim! Also wore it for valentines day, so I got some great uses out of it!


I love it


Perfect


NO COMPLAINTS


Love the dress
