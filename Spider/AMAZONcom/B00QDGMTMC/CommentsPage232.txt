my only complaint is the material… the seller should have put up better pictures.. its more of a Tshirt Material… the kind that gets all the little balls after our purse or jacket rubs it too much… Not too happy with this. But it does fit properly, I got the biggest size, and I am a Large regularly.


Great


Amazing dress!!!!!


Just like picture


Color is lighter than image

Love it


nice


it was too small. I am a true size 10 and I ordered a large. The material is thin but the color is really pretty. If you are in shape it will look great. If you are not in shape grab some spanks or support of some sort because it will show everything.


In love with my dress!!!!
