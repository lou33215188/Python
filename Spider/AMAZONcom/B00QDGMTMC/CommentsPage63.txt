I really wanted to like this...it was just too small. I'm 5'2", 140lbs, and the medium was too tight. I returned it. Keep it classy, girls.


I live in this dress. It fits perfectly, looks great, and I get a million compliments every time I wear it. It's perfect just to run to the store in because it's so comfortable but I can also wear it to go out. Love love love!


Very nice material.  Very stretchy but comfortable


My go-to black dress...throw on cardigan, blazer or cute jacket


While I love the way this dress fit I ordered a royal blue and I received black I am disappointed that I did not receive what I ordered


This is a bit too t-shirtee to me


It is knee length, which I do like, but the material is a bit too thin


You would probably have to wear a slip in order to avoid awkward situations at work


I am usually an X and ordered an XL but I still feel like it is a bit too tight


I will need to loose a few pounds for a better fit


Perfect fit. I got a small and am 5' 5' about 129lbs. It was a great price and I always get compliments :)


Love the dresses i ordered however it runs small. 2x fits like xl


Beautiful simple and classy dress. I am usually a medium and ordered the medium/large, it fit perfectly! I ordered the charcoal color, the material is thick enough that you don't have to worry about it being see through. I definitely recommend!


Nice dress made out of a decent material. This dress can be dressed up or down.
