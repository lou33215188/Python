Nice length, material a little thin but like the fit.


I like my new dress. The fabric quality is good, it's not too thin. It's a very basic dress. I usually buy S, got this one in S-M, and it fits like a glove. Will not hide any figure imperfections, though.


Super cheap material. I use it as a night gown. Comfy for bed. Oh and it's see through, if you have cellulites or love handles, this dress will make sure to show it!


Quality for good price


Another great dress from Tom's Ware for a great value. This is one my new favorite brands. If you're curvy, this dress will work for you -- not against you, trust me (I'm a size 10/12, 5'9'' and bought an XL).  The length is perfect. I've worn it multiple ways and taken in on two trips. For the price, you'll be very happy! I'm going to by a few more in other colors.


So this is a bit too long for someone  as small as I am, I'm 5' at 125lbs and it came to my shins. The material is very and would need a slip underneath. I love the color and style but just was expecting it to be a bit thicker material.


The most comfortable dress ever. Dress it up or down, this can go formal or casual easily. Fits like a glove with no tightness anywhere - LOVE the jersey feel & effect. Would buy again.


This is a very nice, fitted dress. I love the gray color and paired with a cardigan sweater and my black platform pumps, it's perfect for work and after work cocktails with the girls!


Just what I expected. Ordered a size up due to other people's feedback. Fit perfectly. Will probably buy again in other colors.


This dress fits like second skin and will work perfectly under a jacket or sheer top. Plan to buy one in every color!
