I like this dress a lot. The fabric is very soft and fits very well. The only problem I have with it is that it is very thin and when its on the body an outline of EVERYTHING is seen. Meaning an outline of your underwear and bra along with your body contours. A thong will be visible for sure and going commando may not be an option because with this pink fabric it will show the buttock area and others significantly. Additionally beware of the washing--this type of material will age fast after a wash so take care if you want to preserve it for a while longer.


I think other colors will conceal more things so I will be purchasing more.


Absolutely LOVE this dress! The material is so light and comfy and it fits me like a glove! Very flattering, even for a full figured gal like myself! Can be casual or dressed up with heels and jewelry.


love this dress! very sexy!


Dress fit perfect . Ordered a large for a pink party and it was perfect .. Very stretchy


This dress fits like a DREAM, I'm going to buy it in every color.( I bought green small - I'm 5'6 125lbs) hits below the knee, which is perfect, beautiful color and super comfortable. Buy it.


Hugs every curve to a T order your actual dress size though. Jerzy knit material perfect for a spring anytime outfit.


Love it ... Fit very cute


I'm 5'1 and a half and 175 lbs. Very curvy I ordered this dress in black and a size large. It fit perfect I read the previous reviews about the dress being see thru but barely but I think it has something to do with the color that I purchased I also wore a smoothing under garments to help slim be even more and it was unnoticeable. The material was good quality as well. I've ordered dresses similar but the materials are no where near the same. You get what you pay for. The length was also a bit below my knees and it did stretch out a little around the knees but nothing major. I'm definitely going to order more colors.


Great!!!
