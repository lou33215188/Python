It's very flattering and feels great.


Completely fell apart after being worn 3 times


Dress fit great but its made out of cheap material and you can see right through it in the tight spots. If you're busty or hippy I'd suggest one size up


A little thin, but sexy and stretchy.


Great dress! Ordered it in several colors.  I washed it and it did not shrink more than expected.  Fits beautifully. It is a sheer so you have to wear a slip under it.


I really like the dress. It can be dressed up or down.


I just received this and I would say it is a good weight. It is fitted and will show everything so if you want wiggle room I would go up a size. I'm 5'6, 175 and bout a large. I just hope I can fit a bra on in this thing!


Love this dress! I am petite and it shows off my curves!


I liked this dress. Very sexy and shows all your lady lumps!


I really like the idea of this dress.


It's simple and it works with most body types. I ordered the dark green which is pretty.


The fabric, however, is very, very thin. It is so thin that you can see the different textures of my undergarments!


I might order anther one and double them up-otherwise, a slip or Spanx are required lol It's not office appropriate without something underneath and a sweater or blazer on top.


It looks cute with gold, metal belt and a gold watch. It would be cute with sandals in the summertime too.
