I love this dress. I bought 2


Loved this dress fit perfectly and was comfortable! Color was great got the plum color.


A bit shorter than the other dress of same exact size - nice light material but somewhat sheer


I love this dress, it's comfortable and it hides imperfections.


I wore this dress on my birthday and I loved it. but becareful it shows every curve and I mean EVERY!


Even though it is a little tight, I still like the dress and will order other colors.
