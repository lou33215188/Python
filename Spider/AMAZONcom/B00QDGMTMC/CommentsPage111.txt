I seriously could not be happier with this dress. it's always a gamble to buy clothes online, but it fits flawlessly and is SO FLATTERING. the material has a slight structure to it that won't get saggy like cotton and its very opaque - not sheer at all. I can tell it's going to be great basic piece to have for all seasons - it can be dressed up for any classy event with heels and a statement necklace, it can be work professional with a blazer, it can even be stylish casual with a scarf and a jean jacket and boots! and for the price, it seriously could not be better. and TWO DAY SHIPPING FREE. so seriously. you will not regret buying this dress or from this company.


great dress I wish they have more colors. Will buy from this vendor again I wasn't disappointed at all.


Thank you.  It was a nice fit.


Love the dress. I am 5'3", 131 lbs. I purchased size M. It fit very nice. Snug to my body and complimented my curves nicely.


Great lbd!  It is a nice classic length perfect for a wedding or casual coctail party.  It looks great dressed down with a jean jacket or booties.  The only negative is that it is a little see through.  Other than that, great dress!


The material is thin and not forgiving at all.  It is fine...I will definitely wear it but I can't wear to work (which is why I bought it).  The color is also not a vibrant.


Liked it


The dress fit light a glove but it's very thin. You can see my shape wear through the dress


material looks cheap


If only it fit it would have been perfect!
