Fits great! Work it to work with a leather jacket and flats! Thank you


Dress fits like a glove. Very form fitting and flattering.


LOVE IT


Very soft fabric but oh so cute


Fits like stretch pants.  Not bad.  I'll offer it to someone with a smaller bust size. Color true to picture.


I really liked how it fitted!  The color and the material looked good too.


The material is very thin so I think you will have to wear some type of body shaper just to keep everything looking nice a smooth.  Very nice paired with a blazer for work and nice accessories.  Not too bad of  buy.


Order a size up


Ran small but I kept. What?? They are cute and I can lose weight! lol


too large, too cheap looking, see through, doesn't fit good, it shows every single muscle in your body, which i don't like
