Nice fit.


I have purchased many of this style dress from many other vendors. This one by far the the best quality. While others are made with fabric that stretches and loses shape over the day and is see through in the sunlight- this one is made of that nice thick super stretchy cotton, so it really hugs where you want it to and is not see through at all. It falls at my knees when i put it on, but rides up to just above the knees as you move around during the day.


Have these in a few colors very flattering love it.


So much potential, but way too thin. You can see every bra and panty line.


Love the dress! Fits to size!


I loved the way it hugged my curves! It's the perfect length.


Surprised that this soft-to-the-touch material fit over my extremely curvy body. With good under garments and a well-structured jacket it might work.


Love it


Fits Perfect!!! ordered size large 160l bs


I love the dress. It actually came earlier than expected
