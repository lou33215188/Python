Nice "jersey" dress.  Cute on!


Fits like a charm! Color in picture online is true in person. The fabric is soft and reasonably stretchy and seems to be well made. This is my boyfriend's favorite dress on me because it hugs my curves in all the right places ;)


Fits snug but comfortable will wear tomorrow at dinner.


Very Versatile Love having it as my red dress only problem is it can be very sheer.


The dress is somewhat small, I ordered a large though I normally wear a medium and found it rather too tight around my hips and legs. If you tend toward larger thighs I'd reccomed a larger size.


I bought the L/XL and it was tighter than I anticipated, but still fit well. Very comfortable and soft. At 5’11 it sits like an inch or two above my knee. Good buy.


Simple yet classy, elegant, and tasteful. Great material ! Nice stretch! I ordered a l/xl and it fit like a glove. I'm ordering this in every color! ❤️❤️❤️


Great casual dress for cheap


i absolutely love this dress! I have to agree with the other posters that it is a thin material that is very unforgiving of lumps and bumps. Personally, it doesn't bother me much. I'm not thin, and I've got several lumps and bumps but it's nothing that some shape wear can't fix!! I'm buying this dress again in another color ASAP!! I feel fabulous and sexy in this dress!!


Got this dress for my wife. Beautiful color and nice fabric. Fits like a glove!
