Material is see through


I love this dress, it was delivered how it said, fits great, looks great, I have never before write a review but this one worth it.


Really nice. It's comfortable.


I love this dress. It's very form fitting. I got a S/M and I'm 5'3 115 lbs.


Great fitting dress, except the back zip around the collar sticks up a bit like there is too much material. I really like the length- hits me just below the knee.


Dress was true as far as the picture and the fit.  It was a rather thin fabric other wise very nice.


Fits just as I expected and the material like a jersey material so it'll stretch.


love the fits, shows off curves really well, great casual summer dress, material is a bit thin, so panty lines definitely shows, great for the price


Second dress I bought of this brand fits perfectly and good material.


Must buy! I bought two so far and love the way it fits!!
