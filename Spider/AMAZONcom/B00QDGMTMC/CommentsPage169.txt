The color is precious!


Great fit and very flattering. I work as a bank teller and it's great for all seasons and appropriate for my job as well.


perfect dress for any occasion!  Fits well.


The fabric is see through.  Not even using a full size slip. The slip details are seen through the fabric.


I saw the comments about the dress, so I ordered a size bigger and it fits me very well.


Bought this dress for a cocktail reception and was complimented on it all evening! Fits so comfortably I will be buying it in more colors!


I loved this dress wore it twice


Absolutely love this dress. Flattering,  comfortable, and always get compliments when I wear it. Bought this in maroon, black and blue!!


This is a lovely, good quality dress. I wish I has gotten it in small instead of xs because it fits a bit too snug, which means I can probably only wear it at night. That's my fault though. Overall I love the dress.


I am 5'8" and 130lbs and I bought a size small/med. The dress fits perfectly slim! I have a slight pouch from having a child so I pulled the dress up a little to make wrinkles at the pelvic area and it looks great!
