I kept this one because it fits great.


Good material. ....satisfied with purchase


I liked it...and it fits well and its not too trashy, but I used a cover up because I'm 5'1, 125lbs very fit, flat abs, but I have D cup boobs, so I HAVE to wear a bra, its not an option.  and the dress shows all undergarments and I think that is tacky when you see the outline of someone's undergarments, so I wore a cardigan so everyone could not see the outline of my bra


Love this dress. Great fit. Comfortable wear and great length.  This is my second dress that I order from the seller.  The shipping  was fast.  Love it


true to  size, fast shipping  and I'm  in love with the  dress.


This dress is everything!!!!!


Why I didn't get the grey dress I order I got a green


Great buy! I wanted a classy hot pink dress to wear with a blazer. It fits comfortably and it feels like a soft stretchy cotton material.


Absolutely love the fit and feel of this dress. It's thin material which I prefer and  hugs my body at all the right places. I'm ordering two more :-)


Worth buying !!
