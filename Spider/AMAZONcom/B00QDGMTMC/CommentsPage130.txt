Ladies...if you do not have the body to wear form fitting dresses DO NOT BUY. I like the material since it is thicker though. Everyone complimented me on the fit, but I did have to have permanent ab-flexing going on behind the scenes. ;)


i gave this product 5 stars. quality was on point and fit to perfection.And above all, it arrived sooner than expected.  two thumbs up. keep up the good work


Dress is lovely for layering scarf and jacket. The material is soft and stretchy. I returned it because it was too tight and went past my knees.


Body hugging but flattering


Fit comfortably and got so many compliments on it.  I love the fabric too!


Perfect midi dress!


As soon as I put it on it became my new favorite dress! Soft, comfy, and the neckline is just right so you can wear any type of bra. Shipping was fast. I am very pleased!!!!


Beautiful dress made with quality material! It shows off my baby bump wonderfully, the material is thick so it is not see through and it is very comfortable! Great price for an awesome product!


Love the fit and cut its not too long or too short. Absolutely getting different colors!!


Dress is very tight I guess if you like that okay plus see thru I'm 5'6 and hourglass figure 38 -24-33 and this dress just revealed too much would return but probably just give to girlfriend or charity will not purchase their products again
