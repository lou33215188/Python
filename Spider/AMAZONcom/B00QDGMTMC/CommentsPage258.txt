I have the black one. It's my favorite black dress. It's very simple but it looks so classy.


runs small. not very good material.


Love this dress


Loved how it fit, but this is a dress that you can not hid anything under.. looks very nice if your curvy in all the right places.


Love it!!


Nice


poor quality


Ladies.... This is not "slim" this dress is TIGHT !!!  There's tight and "tramp" tight! If you have hips thighs and a butt it shows EVERYTHING. I am a size 8/9 Summer weight... 9/10 winter.


its a nice dress..the length makes it look a bit classy but the material isnt my favorite but its still nice


A bit see through so I won't be able to wear it without a bra but very good fit!
