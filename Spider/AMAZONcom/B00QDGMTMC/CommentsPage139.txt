F-ing love this dress.


I love dresses by Tom's Ware. I received so many compliments on how figure fitting it was and how great I looked in it. Will be purchasing more soon.


Perfect material for all types of weather. Perfect alone with out anything else.


This dress is exactly as pictured, and is made of quality material.  I may buy more.


Not as contoured as I expected. (As picture). Minor alterations will make it much better though. Not a total loss.


The quality of the item was not what I expected and the fit was slouchy and too awkward. Product received was totally different than the product on the model.


The PERFECT BBD. Love it will buy it again in other colors.


Perfect


The material is really soft. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly.  I am 5'5" and about 112 lbs.


Nice dress but see through cheap thin material other than that really comfortable
