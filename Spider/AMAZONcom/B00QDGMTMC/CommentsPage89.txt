I love, love, love this dress. The quality is excellent and it fits my boyish figure as beautifully as all other shapes. I ordered the green and it is beautiful. I am definitely ordering other colors.


Great fit. Soft fabric with stretch. More causal than I thought with the jersey-like material, but I could be dressed up.


I ordered the dress as suggested by the size chart however it was still to small.  I actually liked the style and color of the dress however I returned.


It's a little snug for being a medium, but I love the way it hugs my curves and the tee-shirt feel of it!!


I am a true size 8, sometimes size 6, depending on style and/or label.  I ordered two sizes and the M/L was too snug fitting for my taste.  I would gauge Tom's M/L to be a true size 6 or smaller.


A beautiful dress that accentuate ALL your curves. It's not a heavy material but the material is thick enough so your under garments won't show. This is a amazing dress to wear in any occasions.


Check size chart before purchasing because their sizes running differently but keep in mind the dress contains spandex.


fits like a glove.


Love this dress. Love the color. And will be buying other colors.


This dress is a gorgeous color, but the material is very thin making the dress sheer. I really wish it could have worked for me, but I need something a little thicker.


I bought 2 dresses in your lg/Xl and neither one fit me well. Fit more like a medium on my body. Not satisfied at all. Sent them back the same day I recieved them
