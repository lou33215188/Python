SOOOOOOO unflattering


I bought this dress for a costume that I would wear on top of this but when I got it, I realized that I would actually be able to wear this at work. This is a dress that you can wear with a nice blazer at the office but you have to be careful if you wear it alone, it will show every crease or "bulge" that you have such as from your bra or the type of underwear you have on. The length was about knee high which I found very refreshing to have because many dresses are shorter than they say and I am very leery about ordering clothes online because I'm not sure how it'll fit me.  I am definitely thinking about buying this dress  but in black and possibly other colors. I am 5'6 and 160 lbs and I purchased a Large and it was pretty stretchy.  I would recommend this product for purchase.
