I received so many compliments. The dress fits perfect!! You can dress it up with a blazer for work environment or wear the sexy look on date night with your honey!!


I'm 6 months pregnant and wanted to buy a dress that showed off my bump- this was perfect! Fit well, and still hit my knees even with my baby bump in the way (I'm 5'5"). I also love the burgundy color! It's more like a berry/wine color, but it's beautiful. I can't wait to buy more in different colors!


The color does not match the color in the image at all, its a completely washed out version more like a pink/peach color. I was really hoping for a deep maroon color like in the image. The fit is good and the quality of the fabric seems good as well though. I'm just disappointed with the color.


I love this dress. The material is good quality.  The fit is perfect.  I ordered s/m...I wish I would've gone with the xs/s though the fit would've been a bit better. It hugs all the right curves hits right below the knee.  I'm 5'7 128 lbs. I def recommend ladies u won't regret it! I will def keep purchasing frm Tom's.


Nice dress. good quality stretch material. I wear a 10/12 and got the medium/large for a fitted look.I loved it so much, I now own every color. ;)


love it


Had to wear leggings under it. It's a bit see through but with the leggings it was great. Loved the color


Great fit, quality is decent. Definitely "hugs" every curve so if you decide to do any sort of bulking this dress won't exactly be forgiving. Once I'm back to my normal lifting cycle this will go back into my closet rotation.


Perfect fit! Hugs every curve! Very sexy! Somewhat see-through but just wear dark underwear...


Love this dress it's sexy but classy. It is skin fitting so keep that in mind when ordering
