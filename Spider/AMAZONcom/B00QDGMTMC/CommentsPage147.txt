Im 5'9.5 this dress is not a midi on me, it barely reaches my knees


Really comfortable but was not as tight as I thought it was going to be.


This is a very nice dress, you can dress it up or down. I ordered a size up after reading other reviews and I could have went with a size smaller.


Excellent quality. Sits elegantly. Took a vacation. Wore flip-flops. Very happy with purchase.


Looked good, body hugging fit, but major wear/piling after just one wearing.


I absolutely love this dress its fitted to my body I went up a size because I read some reviews saying it fits small and that made it perfect!!


Very thin had a hole in top right corner.Very Unsatisfied


I love the dress


Great dress and price! I plan on buying in other colors.


Gorgeous, fits very well and the fabric is forgiving of any imperfections of jiggles you may have. Loveeee! Cannot say enough good things. Will be buying more in different colors!!
