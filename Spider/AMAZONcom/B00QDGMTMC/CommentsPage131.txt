I bought the XL. It got like a medium and it was sheer. I could see everything. My underwear, bra, and my tattoo. I'm definitely returning this item.


Fits as expected


This dress fits amazing!!!!


It's a snug fit, but it is supposed to be sleek. It's comfortable and fits well. It is great as a stand alone dress or for layering.


Product came early and fit was bigger then I thought it would be. You can never really be sure how clothes you order online are going to fit. Very pleased with the dress.


True to size. Fit perfectly!


Itâ€™s a little smaller than I expected


Love it


great quality!  LOVE Toms Ware! Will order new styles/colors again.


I am an xxsmall so I was a little worried the dresses wouldn't fit...they fit like a glove I bought all the colors
