Material is a bit thin, but overall super comfy and very easy to throw on and go. Cute with flats and a cardigan. Very form fitting.


Great dress to dress up or down very thin but Higgs every curve


Love the dress but it runs small as other reviewers stated. Disappointed I had to return it.


It was a little tight, however, it was very soft.


Great color but not made of cotton jersey as the seller posted.  It is 65 percent polyester and 55 percent rayon. Returning.


It looks and feels good...


LOVE THIS DRESS! 7 months pregnant and fits my curves. It'll be cute post partem too! So soft, so stretchy!


perfect little black dress, very comfortable and can be casual or dressy


I love it. Its comfortable and fit great.


Fit great! Arrived ontime.
