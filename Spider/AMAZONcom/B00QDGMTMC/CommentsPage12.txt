So, a good deal of the negative points mentioned by other reviewers are true- the dress is tight, it's thin, it *really* shows bumps and rolls, etc. That's fine with me- I'm a relatively fit 26 year old with access to spanx. It looks good and transitions to night like a dream (the only thing separating "confident business lady" and "high end hooker" is a good pair of stilettos, tbh). I hate shopping, so I'm buying this in several colors.


Tl;dr- If you already feel relatively good about your body/don't mind wiggling into some spanx, go for it.


I love this dress so much that I have to restrain myself from ordering several more in different colors. I have a few similar dresses in my closet in the other colors I want. But this is the perfect combination of a clingy style that enhances my curves without making me look cheap. The fabric is thin but strong, something that is will be very comfortable in our Louisiana summers with temperatures in the high 90s and 90% humidity. Dress this item up with some interesting jewelry and or heels and a scarf or wear a jacket with it for a more professional look.


I love this dress Iâ€™m 5â€�1 and currently pregnant at 35 weeks 118 lbs I bought size small/medium and it fits comfortably and I simply love it! I love that I can also wear it after my pregnancy. The material is super soft and comfy and itâ€™s very stretchy which is great for my belly right now! I will definitely buy more dresses in different colors!!


Awesome buy


Lovely material, fit and cut. I am 5', 105lb and 32DD. Ordered a small and you can see every ripple and imperfection. It's form fitting but fits perfect and the color is more emerald than dark green. Perfect dress for a fun occasion or shower. Cute and fun color!


The dress was as described. I ordered a size up just to be on the safe side and it worked out perfectly. It had a stretch to it which complemented my figure and the hand made accessories i made. The best part is that this dress is a any type of occasion dress. Will be ordering a different color soon


In LOVE with this dress!!!!!!! It's a little thin and hugs every bump and lump but I LIVE in Spanx so I'm ok with it ğŸ˜„ Im normally a L/XL but wrnt with the xl/xxl just to be safe and its perfection! The material is super soft. Can definitely be dressed up or down. I WILL be ordering more!!!


So, I have mixed feelings about this dress.  The material is similar to a "slub knit" which is super soft, flowy and stretchy with tons of movement.  But the material is super thin which makes it hug all your curves and show all your bulges.  It feels like this would have made a really wonderful loose fitting shirt, but if you have any lady baby bumps around your mid section, it isn't as forgiving... unless you sign up for a day of SPANX action. ;)


Good luck ladies! :)


First impressions review! Just received the dresses yesterday and they fit like a dream. I'm about 5'1and about 130 pounds, biggish bust (36c) and bottom (european size 36 or 38 jeans), ordered 2 dresses: I got the black in xs/s and the khaki in s/m to see which fit best...I think they both look great. The xs/s black is just a tad bit more snug, but I think I  can get away with it since it's a dark color: no panty or bra lines and and any post food tummy volume is pretty camouflaged (black is slimming anyway). The s/m khaki: first of all, the color isn't exactly the greige/light brownish color that's shown in the picture: it's more of a light olive green. I'm actually very happy with the color since I was initially looking for a dress in that kind of shade; but I thought it'd be helpful to let anyone know who's considering the khaki, the color in the picture is slightly misleading but still lovely in person. As far as the fit: not that different from the black one; I'm glad I got the s/m though, because with it being a much lighter color some panty/bra lines are slightly visible, as well as a few little rolls, easily camouflaged by a denim vest or a cardigan. The fabric is super soft and a great thickness, it wasn't see through at all, but still very cool; also thick enough to not get all wrinkly. Feels like pretty good quality, will have to see how it handles the wash, but I think it'll be fine. Will def buy again.


I actually wore this as a maternity dress early in my pregnancy and since it stretches can still wear it now. The only reason Iâ€™m giving it less than 5 stars is because it was pretty thin, so you do have to be mindful of what you wear under it! Especially during the day or if youâ€™re taking pictures with a flash.
