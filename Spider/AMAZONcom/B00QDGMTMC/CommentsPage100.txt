SEXY!! I'm 5'4, it comes to my knees, I got the burgundy one and it fits like a glove, but not so tight where you can't breathe...The material is a little thin, but you can't see through it. You have to go commando or purchase a G-string with flat straps.


I absolutely love this dress!  I just ordered the blue in addition to the black one I just received.  I'm wearing it to work today with a blazer.  A slip is needed, but it is so comfortable and holding it's shape well.  Love it!!


Hugs my little body curves lovely ğŸ˜�


I love this dress I ordered a 2X and it fits to a T! this was a good buy for me.


Good quality for the price. Stretchy.


Nice dress. Don't like how it fits me.


Love. Follows the curves of my body ... And as a tiny girl I don't have many and usually normal lady clothes are too big. This fits perfect!


Fits great, love the fabric its super comfortable can be dressed up or down. My only concern is finding proper under garments that won't show through because the fabric is thin and somewhat see through.


it fit like a small t-shirt? it is alright


Love this dress and color! So comfortable.
