Love This Dress def need more in other colors


Dress is horrible and cheap looking.


Returning it for a full refund.


Love the dress. Slightly small. Undergarmets/shapewear is needed.


I wore this for the first time last night to dinner and it looks amazing on. I have the charcoal color. Incredibly flattering. I just ordered a 2nd one in red today.


It fits perfect. I love the style and color. I bought dark green. I weigh 150 with boobs and a butt it looks great.


Love it! Ordering more colors soon!!


Fits like a glove! This is my third dress.


Great dress. Very comfortable and stretchy.


The dress is very cute and true to size. Highly recommend!
