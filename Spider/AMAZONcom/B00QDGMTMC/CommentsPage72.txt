Lovvvveeeee it to the tee, very comfy material . Wear it every chance I get . Going to get another one.


It is just a bit snug.  I read the warnings, the reviews, and the size charts and I ordered appropriately.


I love this dress, it is actually my favorite warddrobe peice at the moment. it fits great and is good quality. I wear a 14 and purchased th XXlarge.


The material is very sheer but other than that, it's a nice dress, just need to wear a slip under it to feel fully covered up.


Love this dress and very happy I decided to purchase this. I ordered the Black and Gray and planning on ordering more colors. I prefer fitted dresses and went with a XS/S. But compared to Bebe and Venus clothing sizes, this runs a little smaller. I would order a size up next time.  I'm 5'3'' 138lbs. I know I will be wearing these dresses daily for the summer!


Very sexy dress but anyone can see what's underneath. Too thin


Far too small.  Disappointed.  However, this was my first ever return, and it was very easy to do.  Pleased with the return service.  Thank you.


I love this dress!!! I wear my body shaper underneath. I'm 5"5, 149lbs, and the size M fit beautifully.


Beautiful color!  Fits perfectly.  Nice and very stretchy.  Cute with heels or sandals. Absolutely love this dress!!


I love these dresses! I've purchased them in two colors and want them all. Perfect for work with a cardigan. The neckline is modest.
