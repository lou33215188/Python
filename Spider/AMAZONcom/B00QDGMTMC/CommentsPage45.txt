Great product!


Very form fitting and tight but comfortable as i expected. It clung to all my curves nicely but still soft enough that i could move in it. The only thing i didn't like was how thin it was. it wasn't that bad or incredibly see through but i feel like for someone as skinny as me all my bones were showing.


Nice, thick, quality dress, just not really what I'd call khaki - more of an olive. It defintely looks brownish gray on my screen, but be well aware, it's definitely olive green.


This dress is super sexy & it shows all your curves. The material is thin & it's great to wear in the summer or spring. I can put on a blazer & wear it to work or wear it as is for a night on the town. Great dress 4 a great price!


I loved this dress. The sizing guide was spot on. Super comfortable. I got the black color and it wasn't see through at all. I'll definitely be purchasing more!


I want a full refund in this one cause it came with a hole in the back


Love it! Great buy!


Very pretty color but size up 2 sizes! I am 5'4" 125 and usually wear a small. I sized up 1 size and should have sized up 2. However, Its a pretty dress and I'll wear it with shapewear.


This dress is awesome! Fit is true to size and the color really pops!


Nice fit. Nice color as it shows in the picture. I would be even happier if they have it with (rayon/modal/spandex without cotton) which makes it even lighter and more comfortable to wear. Great price.
