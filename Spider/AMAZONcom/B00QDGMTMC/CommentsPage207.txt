It was a nice fit, perfect length. But the material was so light and flimsy I could not wear it outside the house, so unfortunately I returned it.


Great dress. I like it. Definitely would recommend it. I bought the blue in my size, S.


I got an extra large and it was way too small.  I wear it as a shirt and gather it in the middle for fashion


Very sexy. Comfortable
