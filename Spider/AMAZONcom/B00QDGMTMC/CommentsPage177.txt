Although you would have to wear specific under garments with this dress. It is still a great buy and great for curvy ladies (very form fitting).


Different material than I expected.  It is very snug,  tee shirt material.  It does look very nice although  not formal fabric.  Hides bra and underwear ok  in the blue. .


This dress is just perfect, I love it. I'm 5ft1 and it stopped right below my knees. It is just OMG!!!


True size,  loved


I love this dress! They have a beautiful selection of colors and the fit is amazing!


Fit perfectly. Arrived fast! :)


Got this in the purple color for a wedding but had to return. Very tight fitting and material was almost see through.

I love it
