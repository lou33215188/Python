Great dress! Fits like a glove, I'm very skinny and size small so I bought a medium and it's perfect. The fabric is thin but you cannot see through it, I think it's a perfect dress for a date.


Fit is perfect and the fabric has just the right amount of give in it


Nice dress. No the best material. But it's a nice dress.


Not a very flattering design or fabric.


Not at all what it looks in the picture


Perfect fit


Love this skirt. Will probably order a another color. Thick fabric, well made for the price surprisingly.


Fits nice but looks like a washed out kool aid...but was expecting a rich purple like in pic may not buy again


LOVE IT


when I first saw this dress online, I knew I had to have it. After I ordered and received it, I could not have been any more excited. My dress is fabulous and fits perfectly. A very happy customer.
