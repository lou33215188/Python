good


I'm 5'4 & 115 lbs. 34d in the bust with 28" waist. I ordered a large based reviews stating size ran small & it fit perfectly. The material is a little thin but perfect for summer weather and to the office with a cover. I ordered black & grey and love them both.


Same size in description, awesome


Bought several TW dresses and I love them all. Fit's small ish but not terribly small, great fit, comfortable.


Great little dress! Very flattering! Very comfortable!


Fits like a glove! I wear size 5 Jeans.


It fits me perfectly


It's a very tight fitting dress but I love it! Looked great on, I would buy another


This dress is incredible. It fits my body perfect. It's very soft, comfortable, sexy and classy all in one. Highly recommend to all the ladies who like to show of their body while playing concervative.


I am 5'5", 125 pounds with DD boobs and I ordered a medium. It fit perfectly! I love it! I had ordered it for me Halloween costume as a zombie Cruella Deville and planned to destroy it some but now that I tried it on, I can't bring myself to mess it up.
