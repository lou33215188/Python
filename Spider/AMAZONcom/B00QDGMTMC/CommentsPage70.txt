As expected, and I ordered up, but I totally love this dress! Super comfy and of high quality fabric.


Disappointed I love Tom ware clothing this not flattering to my curves. It does not  look good. I  will send it back. It does not look like the picture!


very flattering for curves. got a lot of complements. can be dressed up or dressed down. very soft material. however, i suggest hand washing because this material seems to hold oil based stains easily. i bought two, will buy another!


I'm 5'2" and 110lbs. This size small dress fits nicely without feeling like I'm stretching the material and making it see through. It feels like soft t-shirt material. The length is perfect for me, going down about 3 inches past my knee.


It's a bodycon dress it hugs every curve so wear a spanx :)


OMG WONDERFUL DRESS!! Hugs all my curves. Received many compliments.Obsessed and will be ordering again in different colors


Looks very hot on my tall wife 5"9  34C. 135lbs .but definitely on thin side with the material!


Guys make sure your woman only wears this when you go out together,This dress


attracts a lot of attention.


Very thin.


This dress is amazing, the fabric is so soft. I can't believe how affordable this dress is. I just ordered another one in black. I ordered the M/L, I'm 5'0 and 152 pounds. The dress is a perfect length, I thought it would be too long because of my height but surprisingly it's not.


The fabric is good but the product was stitch bad couldn't wear one side had a bad stitch so it was open but I like it gonna try get it mend
