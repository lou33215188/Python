Love the material . Runs a size small.


Perfect dress


I LOVE this dress! It makes me feel unintentionally sexy.


This dress fits amazingly on my small frame. The color also looks great on me!


The color is great and the style is great, but it was really tiny. I wear a size 0-2, so I ordered the XS/S. It was trashy tight, not sexy tight. Since I'm a teacher, I'll probably go up two sizes. I just hope it isn't too big.


Love it


The material is a little cheaper than I expected it to be and rather long ... But still looks descent on


Great Dress!


Absolutely love this dress!


The sizes run small, but I love the style.
