Very tight around the stomach area but I'll make it work


I absolutely LOVED this dress! It fits all of my curves but allows me to move around. I can't wait to wear this to work. I would love to dress it up or down!


I ordered the Green in a Large (US M) It fit like a glove! The color was rich and vibrant. The material was really comfortable and stretchy. I did wear a full shape wear slip under this dress because the fabric is unforgiving but that was to be expected. It was the perfect midi length. I wore this a fashion show and felt fabulous. If you are a curvy girl like me (5'4", 140 lbs 32, 28, 40) I would recommend getting a size that you will feel comfortable in. If I would have gotten a small it wouldn't have fit and a large would have been too big. The shipping was fast and I will be purchasing more. The length is great you would wear it with a blazer or a sweater and dress it up or down. I was really happy with my purchase. You can wear your regular bra with it and be totally comfortable. This dress is a show stopper for sure! Just know this dress is tight and meant to show off your curves so be mindful when selecting your size. The sizes on the site will show bigger but when you add it to your cart it will show the US size so pay attention to that. Very Happy with the price &some of them are PRIME eligible. LOVE LOVE LOVE my green dress! <3


The fit is a little large. Bit fits better after wash.

My girlfriend wears this dress often. It fits her well and her butt looks great in it.

Worked perfectly for my barbie costume :) and can wear it out. Super comphy and form fitting.


Absolutely love this dress. fits like a glove. careful getting it wet, it turns white in that area. not the best quality coloring, but For the price its worth it. Not very professional in person though.  Im a size 6, 5'5, 125 lbs. 38 in hips, 29 in waist. hope this helps
