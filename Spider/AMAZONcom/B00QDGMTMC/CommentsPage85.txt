This is very comfortable and can be dressed up or down. The color is gorgeous.


I could wear this dress everyday. So comfy and versatile. Be sure to follow the sizing suggestions, I ordered a few sizes up and its perfect.


Love love love.... I normally get small but order a medium now that I'm pregnant and it fit perfectly.


Gorgeous dress! Super soft to the touch, quality material and gorgeous color!


Yes, the dress is curve hugging (you can see my belly button through the dress) so don't wear it if you are going to be self conscious. This is a show stopper dress. Throw on a belt and heels and rock the hell out of it!


I am 5'5" and 170-180 (depends on the day/month)  I have curves and this rocks them!, comes to mid thigh (purchased L/XL)


I got a small/medium  I'm 180, 5'0 feet, double DD, 33 around the hip and it fits perfect.


I originally ordered the midi dress in a pink in a s/m. It was for a pink dress event for breast cancer at a local club. The s/m hit about an 2 inches above my knee. Perfect "club length"! I then ordered it in the burgundy in my true size l/xl in the burgundy color. The dress fit like a true mid and stopped about mid calf. Perfect for the office! Both Time I rated the dress a 5 stars. However when I order the same l/xl dress in blue, I was sent a mismarked s/m. I would not have mind the length so much if I wanted another "club length" dress. I was going to send it back but I think I'll just keep it wear it in the spring. I would also like to note that both the s/m and l/xl dress fit my hourglass figure well. I would not suggest this dress if you are a true xl. The dress is very unforgiving in the mid section area, as it is made on bodycon or form-fitting sheath style. I have had two great experiences with this dress and I plan on ordering it in at least two or three more colors and sizes. I only gave it such a low rating this time because I received an incorrectly marked dress. Other than that I fricken love this dress!

Fabric is so cheap it is basically see through.


It's a comfy dress, but it definitely highlights every bulge. I'm a tall medium but ordered the XL after reading reviews- it's a little snug!!


Very nice fit and comfortable. Pretty color too. I ordered the plum dress and since it's so inexpensive, I may order the red dress also.
