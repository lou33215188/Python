Quality is better than I thought it be. Fits great! Price is great!


I haven't felt this beautiful in years. Perfect dress. Hugged all the right curves and gave me confidence.


Bough it in the color charcoal and will definitely be buying one in coral since it looks and feels fabulous. I have a curvy/athletic build & wear a size 8. The small/medium fit me perfectly!


I love the color!


I loved this dress and so did my husband,he could not take his eyes off of me! I would definitely order from this vendor again!


This dress is super very thin. If you purchase please buy a dark color. I bought a s/m which is a nice fit. Except for it been super thin. Also very see through. Please buy a darker color. Also if you are not to much in shape (not being rude) and you purchase this dress keep in mind its very bery fitted to your body.


This feels amazing!! I love this dress!!! It gives you curves all the right feels. You can totally dress it up or down with the right accessories :)


Curve hugging and cute. The light purple is heathered, so it is a bit casual, but still sexy!


I will buy more colors for sure!


Nice dress just like in picture


This dress feels and wears elegant. The fabric is slightly thick for lycra and it shows. It's a well made product and you can dress it up and down. The material has a slight shine to it which is great doesn't look like a cheap polyester dress.
