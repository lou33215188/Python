Seems shorter and tighter fit than expected


Very cute dress. I love the fit! I plan on ordering the dress in other colors.


Fit perfit


I was elated when i tried it on, its not transparent and fits nicely. would definitely purchase again


bad fit


Thin material, but that was expected considering the cheap price. I am 5' 5, 127 pounds, slim figure. Fits well, light colors may be unflattering! Careful


Cute!


Dress came a week later and fits as expected. Don't expect too much when you're paying less than $20 for a dress.


Absolutely love this dress it hugs all my curves and makes me feel very sexy. Purchased a Large I'm about 5"9 and I'm about 187


Material is thinner than expected and fits smaller  than expected, I would return but can't be bothered


Fits well, but shows everything. I'm a little self junctions to wear it.
