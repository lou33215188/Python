Pretty color but WAY too small.  Also, it is not rayon, as indicated.  It is polyester, which I will not wear.


the dress fits and feels BOMB


I wanted to love this dress it just was not long enough.  Very pretty dress though.  IF you are short and have curves i highly recommend this dress.


I bought green and black in the medium/large size because I always wear a medium. The dress fits well and tight. Both dresses say large on the tag. The black is amazing, and I wore it to my HS reuniuon, and it was super comfy all night. The green obviously shows more lines because it's a lighter color. I'll probably wear the green one in the winter with a jacket or scarf to distract from the crater hole my belly button makes in the dress.


love it. the color is what you see


This dress fit well and the material isn't cheaply made


Very cute and flattering.


Am I missing something here? People love it, but it's pretty much just a tube dress.  No structure. Fits every curve and bump.  I generally wear easily a size 10 but this was small.


Too small


GORGEOUS BUT extreemely body hugging. you can wear underwear without it being seen. bras are pretty obvious too. I suggest you go commando or wear a special made undie so you dont see all the panty marks. Got my mom one in the same color! (wine)
