very pretty.  Had to order Large (I take 8-10) as those stretchy dresses really fit snug.  The large is o.k. but could be just a little roomier.  Very happy with the dress and price.


Easy little dress for everyday. Love it.


I absolutely love the fit.


The material is unforgiving, especially in the midsection. Underwear? Forget it! Unless you have 6 pack abs, I wouldn't get this dress. Beautiful color and great length tho


Great dress fits well


Lovely fit!


Awesome dress.  I love the material and length.  It is form fitting so the undergarments must be seamless.  Great dress to dress up or dress down.  Getting 2 more colors.  Can't wait to post pix


bien!


Exactly what i expected.would definately recommend.
