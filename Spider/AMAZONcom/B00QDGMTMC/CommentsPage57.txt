Love! Material is perfect weight and dress is comfortable!


I ignored the other reviewers who said this dress is sheer.  Well they are right, this is not office appropriate unless you have a long sweater to hide your butt.  Even then every panty and bra line is made super obvious by the fabric.


Love the dress true to size.


Couldn't love this dress any more! Wore it to an evening wedding and it dressed up very nice!


Thicker material than expected for a jersey dress. Great fit ; I wanted it to fit snug (5'1/130 lbs/x-small-small) & it's just what I was hoping for.


I do agree with everyone else in that you will need some decent (smooth) underwear because everything shows.


I should've returned this but I was just too tired. I never wore the dress and it is not the color that is advertised. It's see-thru.


Super thin. Can't wear underwear, unless it's some type of support garment. Shows every single curve, lump and cellulite bump. Very comfortable, prefect for a casual night out.


I bought this dress for my baby shower at 8 months pregnant (normally a size 10, 5'4" 160) and purchased an XXL to have the extra belly room. I received SO many compliments and am excited I can wear this again down the road. It is slim fitting, but I expected it based on this brand, and wore spanx underneath to smooth my lines. Might end up getting this in more colors!


hugs curves , soft material , simple yet chic.


I thought the color would be darker but it is nice.
