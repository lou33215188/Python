It fit perfect! Usually when they say xs itâ€™s always bigger but this fit me perfectly.


I love the way this dress fits....just received my 2nd dress in a different color.


Very nice five stars


This is an OK dress. Its soft but the material is very thin so you see every lump and bump. Other than that it works. Oh and the color is a little more true green than jungle green thats displayed in the picture.. But for $25 not bad.


I absolutely love this dress! I am 6'2 and approx 145 lbs, I ordered a size med/large. The length was perfect! Just an FYI- undergarments will show! Either go commando or wear seamless undies.


This dress is great! It hugs my body well without being so tight that it highlights all my flaws


Super soft and lovely, but extremely long (~6 inches) compared to the gray version in this product listing!


It's ok


Love this dress so much that I purchased in two colors!  The material is nice cotton and looks good for the price.  I would recommend this anyone who is looking to find a versatile dress, good quality at a great price!


Love this dress. Material is thin, but the color is true to picture,  and it is very classy given the price.  Would buy again.
