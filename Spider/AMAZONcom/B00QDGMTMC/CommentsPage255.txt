Beautiful dress! Fits me perfectly and shows off my curves. The fabric is light and soft, Be careful with washing this though


Loved it. Pretty sure Iâ€™m going to order more. ğŸ’š


Love the snug fit look, I'm truly please with this purchase..


for the most part i love it there were some that didn't work for me but others were great


Great dress! Absolutely love it! Fits true to size and is super comfortable and sexy!


I have this dress in black and I love it! It fit perfectly, I didn't have to order a size larger or smaller. Like another reviewer mentioned - it does show an outline of everything under it. That would be the only negative.


totally worth the money and fits like a glove


SUPER soft, i've ordered another in a different color because i love it so much but i am 5 foot 1 and 115lbs and the xs/s is a bit loose and it hits about 4 inches below my knees


This is perfect gift for my girlfriend! It really does emphasize the shape of her body and she looks even more sexier. Perfect for an evening dinner!


I love it
