I ordered this dress due to the fact that it had decent ratings it did not disappoint the dress fits beautifully is not cut too low not cut too tight at the sleeves it is the right length and the material is nice and soft it fit beautifully I will purchase more


The outfit fits well. I got it for work thinking it would feel right. The fabric is soft and stretchy, and kind of clinges to my body. Not convenient for work.


Love the fit


Love this dress! Although the material is pretty thin, it's surprisingly flattering. That is, if you don't eat at least and hour beforehand, squeezed an ab workout in, and wear the right shade and texture of under garments. This dress doesn't hide a thing.


Runs small. Normally a Medium, I ordered an XL. This seems to be the right size. Hugs the curves without being over-streched.


But.


The fabric is really thin. Was hoping for work-wear. Can't do it. every bra and underwear line shows. And plenty more details of my curves than are safe for work. Bummer. If the material was a bit thicker it would be awesome and I would order 5 more. I even tried a slip underneath. Still not safe for work!


Great fit! Great quality, and it reaches by my knees which is awesome! I am 6feet


I sincerely appreciate the dress design, color, texture, and fit. The quality is better than what I was expecting. This dress is very unforgiving of flaws so order your appropriate size.


Great purchase
