Such a simple dress..and fits comfortably and also great fabric. I am able to dress it up for work with a blazer and heels, or just heels for a night out.


HORRRIBBLLLE and cheap. don't waste your time and your money. I gave it one star because it's a requirement to post a review.


Way way way to small


It looks good


Great fit and color, constantly receive compliments.


Love the color runs a little small but overall 5 stars


The dress is horrible, the fabric is a bit transparent and thin. I did not like this dress do not buy it , you will lose your money. =(


Perfect fit.


Fits like a glove! Nice and stretch for curvy girls.


I ordered the dress to wear for my birthday on Friday. It fits like a glove!! The dress is simple and elegant, and I plan to dress it up with gorgeous jewelry and shoes!!!!
