Very flattering fit!


Beautiful dress, fits like a glove. Works well for many body types - I'm on the slender side with curves (not quite as much as the picture, but close) and it accentuated all the right places. Definitely wear seamless panties though, it'll show lines. I wore tights with it for a holiday party and that worked pretty well to smooth out any bumps.


no complaints


This dress is hot! My husband loves it bc it fits and shows off my curves. The color is gorgeous! I will definitely be ordering other colors!


Great dress


Very comfortable, but be warned, will show every curve. Would behoove the wearer to wear a spanx or other undergarment underneath to avoid looking lumpy


I am a size 16 with a lot of curves. I got this dress in a 2x and I love it. I do have to wear a bodyshaper but I wear one with most dresses. Overall I like how it fits.


The fabric was very thin and the dress was at least 2 sizes too small. Returned it for a prompt refund. Good service, but will probably not buy from this brand again.


at third wear the fabric of this dress ripped a slit right above my bosom whilst trying to pull it down from wearing it. so fabric very light and fragile


I love this dress, I have three in different colors. I actually double them to feel more coverage. I have both extra small and small.
