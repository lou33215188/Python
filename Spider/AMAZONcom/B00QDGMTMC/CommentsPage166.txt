Love this dress! You can dress it up or wear casual with sandals.


I had no problem with it , fits as expected I love it perfect for my curves


Great Fit!! Fast Shipping!!


Absolutely love it!


VERY COMFY! I love this! However, it is a tad thinner than expected. No actual complains, though, since the quality is good for the price.


Fits perfect and I love the material


Love love love it


Great length, just past the knee. The only thing is the material has a bit of a shine that you would not have with a cotton garment.


Great


Can't wait to wear this out. The fit is great and it isn't too tight. It fits really good.
