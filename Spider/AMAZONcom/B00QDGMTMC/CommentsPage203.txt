The dress was just as described just a little too big should have gotten a small


I will return this for a larger size; the material is very sheer. I like the length.


Great fit


Material looks cheap, not what I expected


Perfect


Super cute! I'm 5'6, 160 pounds, my measurements are Hips 37 Waist 30 Bust 36 . I am a little curvy and it fits me great!


pretty


I am 5'7 " 165 lbs,,. I ordered this dress in L/XL and it fits perfectly. The material is not too thin.


It reaches right to my knees so it is discreet enough to wear to work but still sexy enough to wear out for a date or dinner whit friends, I bought a red one first, but I liked it so much I bought two more,  blue  and teal.


I highly recommend this comfortable, versatile and classy dress and will be ordering it in more colors soon!


Great product


I love it and so does everyone else
