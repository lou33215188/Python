The dress is nice for the price but I was disappointed with the color. I ordered the green and it showed it to be a deep bluish green in the photo but it is more of a bright kelly green. I really liked the darker color better but didn't have time to order another dress for St. Patty's Day so I just had to wear this one. Oh well.


Absolutely love this dress.  I bought the small/medium and it fit perfectly. I am 5'4" 120lbs and it falls half an inch below my knee.


I bought this produt i'm very happy, verry good quality. Fits as I expected.


As I've stated before on different reviews, I love this brand and their material. Well made dresses and a good brand. Has good stretch. Will get other colors in this. Nice summer dress.


Even for a plus sized girl. The large is perfect. It fits. It's comfortable and the perfect length.


Love the color and it is nice to wear.


Really amazed at this product.  You would never imagine such a garment for this price.  It is so basic a person should have this in many colors.  It is snug and it is stretchy but none of that was a surprise.  Very comfy too.


to tight for me


Very nice color fit great


True to color, good fit, but the material is kind of thin. Compared to his other dresses where the material is thicker which I like because I feel like it hugs my curves better.
