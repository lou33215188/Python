Love this dress!!! It's tight but a good material


Great fit


This was my very first clothing purchase from amazon and I was beyond skeptical.  I can not tell you how many times i would log on read the reviews then log back off without purchasing but I finally did and I have no regrets.  Fits like a glove will be purchasing more colors I bought the royal blue and a green one.  The perfect go to dress for any occasion you can wear you can dress it up with accessories or keep it simple with a jacket for the office.


Too thin material


not


Good quality for the price. I ordered the XL in grey. I'm 5'7 and usually wear a 16/18 in pants. My rear and hips are very full and this dress still comes below my knee. It does ride up a bit (most skirts do) but still not much past the top of my knees. I'm going to order a couple of more.


Love it!
