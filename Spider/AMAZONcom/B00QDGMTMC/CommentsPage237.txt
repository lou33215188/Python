I ordered two sizes up so that the bottom wouldn't ride up as I walked and it worked out well. Still travels north while I walk and requires frequent adjusting. Grey color lets in light through the legs when backlit. Suggest wearing with leggings and boots.


Dress is so cute.. super soft and comfortable. I'm really glad it fits. Im 5'2" and about 180.. Only problem.. the color is way off from the pic color


I sent wrote review on the one dress this is the one that didn't look good on my granddaughter because of her shape. The color and material is great. I need to send this back.
