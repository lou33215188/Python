I'm 5'10" and 165lbs.  The L/XL fit wonderfully!  I bought a full slip, to wear under it, and that took care of any panty/bra line issues.  Love it!


Ordered an Xlarge. I wear a large or 12. Fits perfectly. Loved the color. Would purchase again


Looks and fits well.  Nice material too!


Color is nice, dress is a great length. Not the most flattering fit for me to wear just on its own, but definitely still will wear with a blazer and heels


My sister like it


Bought this for my gf and it fit perfectly. Her but looks AMAZING in this dress, but she is self conscious about it being so tight to her body(mainly stomach). Which is crazy bc her body is ideal for most women. (Especially the stomach)


Plan to order in other colors.


So comfortable! I wear the black for work with a cardigan or blazer over it.


Great dress. A must buy


Great buy for the price, love the color (green). I purchased the xs/s i should have went a size up being I usually wear a size 4 I'm 5'1 134. But I wasn't sure if it would fit too lose. But it still fits great!
