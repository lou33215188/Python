This dress is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!


Great material, great length, great fit, has stretch to it. I liked it so much that I ordered from the site again today.


Tom's dresses are the best


Super sexy. I hugs every curve which means I have to find the tiniest g-string that will not show or nothing at all.


The fit on this dress is good, but the fabric is very thin. It seems more suited for underwear.


Extremely small


Cute dress. Fit is comfortable and easy to wear. You can wear this dress all day and get a lot of confidence n compliments


Perfect fitting dress. I'm 123lbs breast size 34DD, waist 27ins, hips 36ins. The material stretches which works well since I always have a hard time finding clothes to fit since I have a small waist with hips.


Love it, just what I was wanting. At first I thought it was too small but it fits just right.


Dress did not fit as I thought it would and also didn't look like the picture that was shown.
