Nice dress, just have to be careful what you wear under it, shows every single line


Runs a little small but I ordered a size up and it fits well.


Fantastic dress. Fit was great (I got a small, I'm 5'4" and 135lbs) and no undergarments were needed (as I got the Black color). Dress length reached down pass my knees, closer to my ankles. I liked it as I preferred the long look. Will definitely look forward to buying in other colors.


It's not that it fits too small, per se; but rather, glove-like and cheap..  Returned.


This dress is simple and feels great. It's comfortable and can be dressed up or down.


Love the color. It does run really small, and is very form fitting. I am 5'4, 90 lbs, and I ordered medium. I did like how it fit, mostly, but would have gone up a size as I prefer to have a little more breathing room.


This dress is really cute and comfortable, but not true to size. After reading the reviews, I ordered a M/L and it fit like an xs/small. It was so tight that it looked trashy. I'm 5'8 and 125lbs, so a m/l should not be skin tight. Sadly returning this dress.


I'm 5'7" and 145 pounds; I normally wear a size 8/Medium. I ordered the large, which technically fit, but the fabric is really thin and not at all forgiving.  I bought this dress to wear to work, but it shows EVERYTHING. Even shapewear couldn't make this appropriate for an office setting.


Very flattering dress and nice long length but need to order up a size


It is necessary to wear a slip or something under the dress.  If you have to bend down to pick anything up, it is possible to see your underwear through the dress.  Even nude underwear will be visible without a slip.
