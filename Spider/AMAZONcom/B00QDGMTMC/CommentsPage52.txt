I absolutely LOVE you guys!!!!!! My dress hugs me soooooooo perfectly. I ordered a 3x due to the Asian sizing. I'm normally a L/XL and its perfect! Can't wait to wear it!!! I wanted to add photos but i dont know how. If ur questioning ur decision to order with this seller question NO MORE!!! GET THE DRESS!!!!!! plan on ordering again soon.


Absolutely love this dress. Simple, comfortable and classy. Its below the knees so you i don't have to worry about pulling it down all day. And it's not thinned, see through material like some other dresses I've ordered on Amazon. It runs true to size and hugs my curves. I'll definitely be getting 2 more in different colors


Returning 2 dresses due to hem line detail defective. Dress uneven based on the type of material. Unacceptable.


I am very pleased so far with this!!


The wine/burgundy color is beautiful. The issue is with the fit and quality. It's too thin and tight. You can see your Spanx line, etc.


A little tight at first , but beautiful . All though it's hard to see in the picture that there is mesh between the straps, they are still very pretty on.


I love this dress!


Love it


Very form fitting and very, very thin material. You will see every lump and bump, but I like the way it looks on me and so did my boyfriend. I am 5'5" 126 lbs; 32C with about a 26-27" waist. I am fit and toned and you can still see every curve. I bought a small/medium in green and red (colors are great). These are asian sizes so they run small. If i buy again i would probably order the next size up to see if it wasn't soooooo fitted.


very thin, however a slip or body shaper will solve that
