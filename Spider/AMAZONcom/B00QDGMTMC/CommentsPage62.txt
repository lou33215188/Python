Beautiful color! Form flattering, very soft, can be worn casually or dressed up. I love it! Will add a picture later! I recommend!! Going to order more colors.


Pretty clingy material - good color though.


Cute but snug fit.  Thin material that requires undergarments for sure. Not office wear due to the material weight. I was hopeful to be able to wear it with a blazer.


The short sleeved version had thicker material and did not run as small. Still pretty but best with body suit to reduce panty lines Around hips. Was okay today before washing just wearing it with usual undies but once it shrinks a little...


Perfect..hugs every curve. This should be worn with a smoothing undergarment. Control top stockings are great for this type of material...just cut the legs off and keep it moving.


Fits like a glove and the length makes it classy. Love it.


Can't wait to wear it with some sandals or white keds


Love it.  Get compliments in yet another Tom's Ware dress. The black is super sexy and classy. Thin enough to breath in but not cheaply thin.  Great quality.  I'm hooked!


The dress runs a little small and ordered one size up. The style of the dress is beautiful and fits nicely. The fabric is a little cheap and thin. But otherwise it's a cute dress to wear and happy with my purchase


Beautiful dress and beautiful green color. Only complaint is that it's paper thin, therefore shows every little thing
