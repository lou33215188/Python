The dress wasn't as well made as the picture shows. The hemline was actually uneven and I ended up having to get it altered and cut off into a dress that was above the knee.


I know I ordered the largest size available (US 16/UK 18), but I was sent a size 10. No way that was going to fit! The return process was fairly painless and free, so that's why I'm giving it a 3. Just make sure when ordering, check the size before you complete your order!


it fit well and was pure white, exactly as I expected


I didn't like the quality


Absolutely beautiful and length is just right, which almost never happens.


Good dress


This dress was great. I ordered it as a bridesmaid dress and it came a lot sooner than expected which was awesome. It also fit me exactly as I expected it and the color was exactly as what was shown in the picture.


Very nice dress I love it,


fits perfect. the color was what I wanted. Looks great on me


Fits almost perfect. I'm not the bustiest so it was a little large in that area, but was easily taken in by the bride's aunt. I probably could have ordered a size down and it would have worked. I didn't receive the shoulder cap little jewels though.
