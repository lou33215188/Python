I ordered this dress for my niece's wedding last June and I love it.


It fits perfect, size is very accurate. I received many compliments and I was very comfortable wearing it.


I wear between a 14-16, but usually a 14. I ordered a 16 based off other reviews I read and it fit perfectly. It was a little too long for me because I'm 5'6, but with heels it was fine.


The dress was perfect the zipper just wouldn't go up


I went shopping a lot looking for a long dress and this was by far the best value that I found. Came within 4 days. My measurements are 32-26-33 and the 4 fit perfectly. I'm a little over 5'7" and this is *just* long enough, but I wouldn't be able to wear heels with it.


The only complaint I have is that I expected the colors would be brighter, they are kind of opaque and dark. However, it's a beautiful dress! Fits me like a glove.


5"3 and short waisted so had to have the straps altered, but overall a great quality dress, and of course an excellent price!


I think dress was beautiful the material is pretty good just what I was expecting loved it


One arm hole was much bigger than the other!


Arrived on time. And fit me perfect. I’m 5’5 and weigh 190.. but I’m a little big around my shoulders and was worried that it wasn’t gonna look right but after I tried it on, the dress fitted perfect. Love it!


Dress is lovely but runs extra long and small at the waist line.
