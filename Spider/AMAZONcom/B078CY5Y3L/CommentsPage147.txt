very happy for the money.


great dress at a fantastic price cant wait to wear it in my upcoming event


this is a good dress for the price but it runs big. you should go to the next smaller size. pins looks kinda cheap but you can remove and its fine.


This dress is exactly what I was looking for.  Elegant but not to stuffy.  Feels great on.  Would most order from this source again.


The dress is perfect!. Fits great and it is just what in expect. Bought it for a wedding this Christmas, arrived on time and the fit was great. My only problem was the zipper got stuck a couple of times. But nothing a few house tricks didn't fix.


I am so glad I bought this! Great fit, and style....comfortable and very elegant! I would definately recommend this to anyone.


EXCELENTE
