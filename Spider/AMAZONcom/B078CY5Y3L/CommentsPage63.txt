Check the size chart and your measurements, if you do it should fit you well and you may adore it as much as I do.


The dress was beautiful and it fit perfectly.  I was scared at first and thought I wasn't going to fit in it; especially reading to order a size up.  I tried it on and loved the way it looked on me.


I needed a white dress for a wedding, for  an all white affair for Sept 29th, I went to several stores but could not find anything to wear that i liked.


I normally do not place orders on line for clothing afraid tha it will not fit right, and that I may not like the fabric. Well! the dress fits me fine as far as the size both width and length, the fabric although I knew it was  chiffon, it is a little sheerer than I expected. But it will work. I asked My husband and he liked it.


The price was right. So i guess it is safe to say tha i am happy. Thanks!


Pretty dress for the price. Zipper is a little difficult in one place, but it works with no problems. Fit is pretty average for dimensions given, wish they offered an x-small. Very long dress, longer then expected.


Pretty dress.  Material is nice.  Dress is flowy.  The zipper sticks and is not very good quality.  I will take it in for alterations and get a better zipper put in.  But for $24 can't complain.


Beautiful quality I canâ€™t wait to wear it as the maid of honor


Returned this dress as lovely as it was.  Instead I kept the red dress for the Christmas Holiday!!!


loved it
