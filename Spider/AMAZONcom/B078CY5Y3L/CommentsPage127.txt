This dress is very pretty and is very flattering. I'm a small and it fit very well.


I was really hesitant to order a dress online but I was pleasantly suprised when I received my order. It fit perfect, beautiful dress and I got lots of compliments on it . The length was perfect , the fabric soft n flowing.


I was hesitant to buy because of the variety of reviews but I just needed a cheap dress that looked pretty. I bought a size 10 and I normally where an 8. It fit perfectly. The dress was very wrinkled but I was able to iron it out okay. It looks elegant and the color is spot on. I'm very surprised and pleased that it turned out  good for me. I guess I was one of the lucky ones! The length was great too. I am 5'4" and it is about an inch or 2  too long so it was perfect with heels.


I ordered it for my daughter to attend a wedding, it fit her perfectly, the colorwas viabrant, she got so many compliments on it, it such a bargain with a great quality.


So pretty! I can't believe the price! Will prob order same style in a different print for another wedding in the Fall.  Can't wait to wear it!


Great quality for the price, it fit beautifully and it flows nicely too. The colors are exactly like shown in picture.


The straps were a bit long so I had them altered which worked well. The dress it right at my ankles and I'm 5'7".


The dress fit every where else but it wouldn't zip up fully on my back.


Not very flattering fit for a busty woman, but material is quality.


Very comfortable and fit well. Only issue was two other bridesmaids purchased and had different fit experiences.
