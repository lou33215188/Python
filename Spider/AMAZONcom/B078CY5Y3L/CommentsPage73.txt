For the price, this dress is really beautiful. I followed the size chart and it was a tad large, but was surprisingly stunning and the pink color was lovely.


The only thing I am not satisfied about it is its length ... it is more than 1 foot longer for my size.


Perfect fit! Used for bridesmaid dresses. Not cheap.


This dress though really pretty just like the picture didn't work for me, so I returned it. I have a very deep tanned completion and the colours and style just did nothing for me  maybe it would be better on fairer skin and slimmer build just like the model.


Horrible fit and cheaply made and cheap material. It doesn't deserve a star.


Absolutely great for a wedding. Great quality, great fit. I am 5' 9" and the dress is still floor length.


This dress looks great!!! It was well made and my bridesmaids where so happy with the price!!! It looks just like it did in the picture. If you are a bride on a buget this dress is amazing.


Could not wear. 90% see through. Did not like the material either :(


The dress is really pretty and comfortable, I'm too small so I needed to do some adjustments, but is a really nice dress.


Very pretty dress. I wore this for a simple bay side wedding ceremony. I got tons of compliments on it. It was very low cut though and I bought a bralette to go underneath otherwise my boobs would have been falling out. The zipper was a little difficult to zipper because of poor quality. I wore it almost all day though and it was comfortable and was a nice dress for the occasion.
