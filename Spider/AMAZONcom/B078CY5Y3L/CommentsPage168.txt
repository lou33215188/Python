the fabric looks ordinary and cheap, it's okay if you want to wear something ordinary and you don't care. looks better the picture of amazon as a dress of 100 usd but actually looks like a cheap dress of 5.99 usd.


This was the best find. I was a bridesmaid for a wedding that had gray as the color scheme. There are so many hues of gray... I had a dress before this that was a blue gray and when the bride decided to have everyone do a purple tone, I was scrambling. I had another dress in the mail that wasn't going to make it in time. With prime, this dress was perfect. It has the purple undertone I needed and I didn't even need to get it hemmed. Crisis adverted and it happened to be the best cheap priced dress out of the three that I had purchased. The cleavage is pretty deep so I had a friend sew it up about an inch and I still had plenty of cleavage. It fit a little snug for a size 2 but the height was perfect after wearing 3.5-4 inch heels. The zipper isn't the greatest so be careful when zipping it up so it doesn't break. I am 5'1" almost 5'2" and weigh 120. I don't have any full gown photos.. I will see once the bride gets her album, if I can post it.


I was very surprised by the quality of this dress. It is absolutely beautiful! Although, it displays a little too much cleavage for me, so I wore something underneath. I was wearing the mint green-ish color. If your looking for an inexpensive & elegant dress. You'll find it here! Thank you so much!


I ordered the dress off my friend's account because she has prime shipping, but I felt the need to leave a review. The dress is kinda wrinkled when it first arrives but that's an easy fix. The fabric is good quality, along with the dress structure. The only bad part is that the dress is SO LONG. I'm 5'2" and even in my 6" wedges the dress ends up under my feet ğŸ˜­ The pictures I'm posting are of me in my heels. Other than that, I love it. Very sexy neck line and flowy leg space. I'll probably have to hem it and I'm considering putting a split up the side.


Perfect, gorgeous, and delivered in 2 days!


I ordered 5 of these for my bridesmaids & 100% happy with them.


I preferred a size up and it's still a little big. A few alterations and good to go


Got this dress for a black tie event. I made some edit by stitching up the clevage a bit and added pockets. It fit amazing and I got so many compliments. The color is great and it was really comfortable in 80 degree heat. It was a bit long on me at 5â€™7â€� but perfect with a low heel. Would definitely recommend this for any fancy events.


This dress worked out well for me!!  (5'2".  147lbs,  38D bra)  Lovely fabric, a deep green color and well made.  I will be closing the plunging front about 3 inches up and hemming it; easy alterations as there is sufficient fabric.  This might be necessary on someone taller; or if I wasn't wearing it to someone's wedding!  I will definitely consider ordering other of their dresses in the future.


I ordered this for engagement pictures, arrived quickly but not that nice. I don't know why I was expecting more, I should know better. The material was a cheaper polyester not the nice flowy chiffon that I imagined. Overall it fit ok, a little bigger, but you could easily tell the difference between this quality and something you would find at department store. Ended up returning it and just spending more for something else.


I'm 5'7" about 140, more bottom heavy. The top was a little big and the dress was too short (I ordered a 6 based on the size chart), it hit the top of my feet, so I would of had to wear flats. Overall it wasn't very flattering on me, so I returned it.  However, the material was nice, didn't look cheap.


A REALLY pretty dress...nicely made.  Im a true 8 and it was a hair too big on top.  A little big in the bust even with a push up bra...I had a tuck put in under the arms.  Has a very plunging neckline.  Length good.  (I'm 5-5, 135 lbs, 34B). I would definitely get another dress from this company
