Great dress beautiful color, perfect lenght and just fitted like a glove, I did pay additional for faster shipping and it came just in time but dint end up wearing it


Very nice dress. My expectations were met.


The dress was a pleasant surprise. The green is actually a pretty emerald colour. The decals were bright gold and none of the stones were missing.


I was nice but one off the brooch didnt have the pin for it to pin to the dress


Very nice dress, fits perfect and arrived very fast.


True to the size Material very thin and cheap. V-neck area is exposed and loose. Shipped fast!


Great material but larger than expected!


This is a beautiful dress.Very elegant ,I was very worried about the sizing but it turned out to be a perfect fit.


I'm already in love with this dress. It fits perfectly and looks great. The print is perfect for a wedding and will still be comfortable to dance in. I won't give it 5 stars just because I haven't worn it yet  so I don't know how it will stand up.


Beautiful dress, ran big based on my measurements. Ill be having to take it in. Other than that it is very pretty.
