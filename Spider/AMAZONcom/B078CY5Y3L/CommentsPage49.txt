I'm 5'3" and weigh 100lbs so I usually wear a size 2 or 3.  But it's fine because I can make my own adjustments.  It's only around the waist area that needs some adjustments. Overall it's a good dress for the price.


I love this dress. I got them for my bridesmaids in green and they were perfect. They look very fancy for the price and fit as expected. I love the smooth flow too. I love them so much that I finally even got one for myself in another color.


Disappointed


Just as pictured. Not very good packaging but product is nice. Needs to be air fluffed because it came wrinkled but nice product.


This dress would be great for a woman with a big chest and a thin rib circumference. It would also be helpful to be tall, although the dress is such a decent price hemming would not be a problem.


Too big so I had to return it


The quality of this dress material was good, and this dress might work out quite well for some people. For me it was a bit too small and didn't fit quite right - it bulged at the armpits. The zipper also got stuck half way up.


Bought this for a black tie wedding, thinking it wouldn't look fancy enough but not caring. It was pretty impressive and held up well. It was a little too tight on top for my liking but that probably has more to do with my bust size than honesty accuracy of size designation.


Nice material and flattering bottom half but zipper sticks at rouching at empire waist. Rib cage is a bit tight.


I like this a lot. I just wish I could wear it. The color is lovely and so is the skirt. The top is not make for busty women. My boobs fell out and made my husband laugh. Not wearable in public. But the quality otherwise was surprisingly good.
