I would like to get an exchange for a bigger size


Materials okay, fit somewhat odd and definitely runs small; required professional alterations for acceptable fit. but price point made such alterations acceptable option.


Perfect fit and is beautiful for a special event. Just as described. The material of the dress has a perfect fall on the body


I don't really mind buying imitation apparel if it is good quality workmanship and it doesn't try to pass itself off as something else. I had bought this dress for an upcoming event because I believed the reviews about the quality and fit. It just arrived today, and I am so very, very sorely disappointed with everything about it, I am at the verge of tears.


The material is very cheap looking in person. It is so poor quality, and makes the dress look like something one picks up at a flea market as a bathing suit coverup. The midrift "ruching" is poorly done, and instead looks like a ratty oversized t-shirt gathered at the sides and hangs loose around the middle. No amount of ironing this thing will ever make it look right.


I expected better quality construction at least for the pricetag of over $120. This is supposed to be an evening dress, but I wouldn't even wear it to a family BBQ, and now I am stuck without a dress for my event.


NEVER AGAIN.


The quality of this dress is mediocre.  I only say this because it was very inexpensive, so for the price, it's great.  It's nice and flowy, however, seems to generate a lot of static.  Perhaps a good steaming will take care of this?  I'm 5'6" and busty and the length is perfect for wearing flats or kitten heels.


Fits really great except around the bust area, it's too small to get over :(


Nice color!


Looks good


the fabric is kind of transparent, and the color is not like in the picture, but is a pretty dress and for a good price!


Terrible, made very cheap.
