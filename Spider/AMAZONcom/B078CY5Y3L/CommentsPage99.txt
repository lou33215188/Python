the dress was awesome , the issue was not the dress it's me  I am short and my torso is too


Very nice dress, I love the color and the fit, it is just a little small around the bust. I just had to order another size larger.


Love it!


Very pretty dress. Fit as expected, but it's long.


a little snug but looked great


this dress was not flattering on me.I really wanted to love it but the chiffon was so wrinkled, no amount of steam would help.


Do not go by your jean size. Look at the fit size chart. This chart helped me picked the perfect size. The dress fits beautifully. It's a lovely dress. I'm 5'7", and I'll need to wear heels, at least 2-3". It's long. I was hoping to be able to go barefoot, as I will be wearing it to get married on the beach. I may still have it altered so I don't have to wear heels in the sand. But it is perfect... exactly what I wanted. I am very busty, and it is in no way indecent. However, you will need a plunge bra to wear the dress without showing the undergarments.


Nice dress. Too small, can't zip up. Have to return it.cant zip up in back. I normally take size 4 but would probably need at least a 6 to get zipper up


Bought this for bridesmaid dresses looks as expected.  I wear between 4-6 but took this in a 8 as I am a D-cup...this size fits, just a little big which means the 6 would have been small.  The length sweeps the ground for me, I am 5.2' this is OK for a wedding.


I loved this dress, and I bought it to wear at a wedding. But since I'm not from US I kind off messed up ordering a smaller size. I Now know I'm a size 8 and not a 6 as I thoght. Since I couldn't change the dress because I'm at another country, I gave it to my sister and it fits on her like a glove. I highly recomend it, in the right size! :)
