Beautiful color well made


Get your correct size. Good quality for the price.


Great dress for the price. Purchased as a bridesmaid dress. It was just slightly too long.


happy it was cheap because the alterations was 90$ to make it fit correctly. Size up if you have a large chest


I'm 5'8 I ordered a 16 for room, buy it ended up being to short. Good thing it's a Halloween. Costume n I can alter it.


Beautiful dress; my only complaint is the zipper is hard to zip up at times.


Love it! I’m 5’5 120 lbs 34a bra. It fit perfectly! There’s plenty of room for a bigger bust but the ruching makes it work on a small bust too.


Everyone said go bigger, so I did and it fit well with a couple of alterations! I am normally a zero but ordered a 4 since it was the smallest size! Super happy with the material, the fit, the color, and the price!


I had to get it altered (too big) which cost just as much as the dress! Instead of the using the rhinestone pins (which were hideous) I just added a gold necklace. Got a lot of compliments.


Truly a beautiful dress. I would recommend this to anyone. My bridesmaid looks great and it is very flattery on anyone.
