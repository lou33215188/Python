Did not like the fabric. Returned it with no problems.


I received this dress and it is very apparent that someone used the dress and returned it. The dress is covered in either dog or cat hair. I didn't even try on the dress so I don't even know if I would like it. I'm super disappointed.


not exactly as nice in the picture.........


Simple dress you can easily dress up or down depending on the occasion.


I loved this dress it's very simple and elegant however, I'm 5"4 and I had to have about 3 inches removed. I'm a 36 on the top. I ordered a size 12 it was very low and the shoulders were falling off. For the price it was worth paying for some alterations.


Ordered based on the size chart. The dress is so large it is not able to be altered. Very disappointed since it wasn't there and correct when I needed it.


You will NOT believe your eyes, when you steam this dress and put it on! Absolutely Beautiful! The color, the fit, the quality and even the price are amazing! Why spend more? Every one of the bridesmaids in my daughters wedding purchased their gowns gladly and looked stunning. They looked like Goddesses, and the embellishments only made the dress even prettier. Honestly, what you see, truly is what you get. Cross my heart!


It's definitely thin, so you will need a slip or something for formal wear.  I bought it to wear for a beach photo, so it should be perfect.  I love that the 'bling' is removable.  Also, this dress fits to the size you think you are- many times formals seem to run small, but this was just fine for me!


The dress looks just like the picture online however, I ordered one size and they sent another which made it a little too big. If I didn't need it for an event in a week, I would send it back.


The dress is beautiful but it was too large for me and hard to alter, I ended up returning.
