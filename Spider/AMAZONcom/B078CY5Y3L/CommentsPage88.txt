I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  Love it!! Will order form this web site in future.


Well made and beautiful color! Pleasant surprise!


Absolutely Love the fit & quality of material.


Great dress just runs very small.  I'm usually in between a 6/8 and the 8 was way too tight


This is a gorgeous dress. I love Ever Pretty, I am always buying their dresses. I must say if you are busty this is not a dress for you. Otherwise it gives you a beautiful hour glass shape, and looks well made. For the price I can't complaint.


i love it, but it needs to be altered...


I like the dress a lot, it's very pretty and fits as expected.  I wear a Halftee under it because I have a larger chest and I don't like to 'spill out'.  Definitely a dress to wear with heels because it's quite long which adds to it's beauty.


The color is a little bit darker than the picture. It was shipped super fast. The neckline is a little bit low but I'm happy with the dress and will be using it for a party in a couple of weeks.


This dress is super pretty, and such a great price! I was invited to a formal party that was 4 days away, and I realized I didn't have a dress, so the prime shipping was super handy. For sizing- I'm 6' tall, 28 in waist, and 34 in bust. I followed the size chart and got a size 6 and it fit perfectly. It was a bit wrinkled when it arrived, but I hung it in the bathroom while I took a steamy shower, and that seemed to do the trick. Overall, I'm very very happy with this purchase. I was only planning to use this dress once, but it's tea pretty, I think I'll get a lot more use out of it. I want to order more in other colors!


Very good
