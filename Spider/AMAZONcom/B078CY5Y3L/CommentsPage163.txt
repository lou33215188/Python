very very long and the "v" in front is very revealing.... cannot use....have to get it adjusted


Very pretty, order big!!Too small!! ğŸ˜©


It was literally the perfect fit! So happy!


pretty


For the price, it looked and fit great!


The dress is beautiful but not ment for a size 12 girl like me. It looked so bad when I put it on I cried for like 2 hours. If you are bigger than a 9 this dress is not for you.


Love love love. Fast shipment and as described


The dress is very cute and length was perfect !!


I need to send it back


It fit my daughter perfectly
