The dress got there when expected, it was everything I was looking for, I just did not order the correct size.  I will return it but plan to keep on looking with you.


Worked out perfectly, no alterations needed! The deep v-neck required the right undergarments. The flower pattern is very pretty. Loved it!


The color is rich, The fit is perfect. And the price is right. A simple design that looks elegant but not too old. Love it!
