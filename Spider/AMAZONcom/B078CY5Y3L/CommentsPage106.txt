Fits great and runs pretty true to size


Fits too tight from the waist, too large from the breast.


This dress is very well made, the dress fit, but it is rather low cut and really meant for a bustier woman than me.  I was able to wear a topper over it and that fixed that.  But for the price, this is a very good quality dress that had a very nice flow.


I'm on the thin side, I'm 5'4, 114lbs  and the small was way too tight for my waist. I would have sized up but I think it would be too


big for the chest area because the size small was already too loose.  Sad because the material and the color is very pretty.


Loved this dress.  Was a little large for me (bought typical size I wear), but was comfortable and beautiful.


I am 5'4" this dress was way too long for me. I had tore turn it.


The dress was too big all around and looked cheap.  The clips for the shoulders looked out of place and didn't add anythig to this dress. I returned it.


I wore this dress for prom last year and it was the best decision ever. Such a beautiful dress.


I wasn't expecting much for the price but I took a chance & I'm glad I did, it's a very nice dess, well made & comfortable


Way to small.  But it is just like the pictures
