Material was nice and comfy. Would be nice on a hot day. Was not bad for the $25 it cost.


Great dress. I wore it to a ball. Looks amazing as long as you dress it up with some jewelry. I got a lot of complements.


This is such a great dress for the price. I did have to have it hemmed and taken in a bit in the bust area, but all in all- it is fantastic. It cost me around $40.00 for the altercations.


The Fabric is nice but runs  big.  I am M and I ordered a 10.  it is too large ...... is have to adjust it to size 6...... even though I am  a Medium


Gorgeous.. Elegant


Beautiful dress... but it didn't fit my bust, knew it would be close, but I think it runs a bit smaller than the size guide.


Bought the size 16. I really should have gotten the size 14, nothing a seamstress can't alter. Very lovely dress.


Its beautiful, but too small. order 2 sizes up if bought again


Very pretty and well-made, but only certain people can pull it off. It is very deep v, so if you're looking for something to show off your cleavage, this is it. The blue is more like a Tiffany blue. The bust area is not padded, so it is sheer.


I am 5'6 and a true size 4 and this does fit perfectly. It is exactly as advertised. I was also surprised to see that it isn't transparent.
