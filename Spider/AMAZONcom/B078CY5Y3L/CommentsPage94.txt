Too small returned it right away.


My daughter wore it to a wedding and it was perfect. Good quality and construction.


The breast lining was too high and the zipper got jammed half way up. Otherwise it's a beautiful dress


Beautiful dress- runs a little large in the chest area, but other than that is beautiful and I love it. Great material, fits great and is very elegant!


Nice dress for the price, had to make modifications cause it was too long and loose at some parts


The v in front was a lil lower than i thought but it was a perfect dress for my sisters wedding!


The shoulder straps were too long so I had to get them altered but fit well everywhere else.


The dress is beautiful!  After measuring myself, I was deciding between a size 6 and 8. I ordered the 8 and it fits great!


Very surprised with this dress, it exceeded all of my expectations! Would definitely recommend, and the price... I bought 4, for my bridesmaids for the price of one dress at a dress store.


The only thing I have to complain about is, the dress is in Junior Sizes...


I had to order a size larger, as I did not want to risk any tight spots.


As I live overseas, sending back is a pain. The dress is very airy and the fabric is very light. After a few alterations on the waistline and bust, the dress now fits perfectly. I am 5'9" and I can wear flats with this dress without having to alter the hem. :)


Shipping was fast (considering USPS to APO), the dress had no wrinkles whatsoever (due to the fabric) and most important it did not smell chemical when I unpacked it.


Purchased it for fun, but it looks so good, it is easily wearable for prom, wedding or any formal meeting.
