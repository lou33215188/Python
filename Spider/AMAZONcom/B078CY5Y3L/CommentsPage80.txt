Be sure you have an inner tube on to wear this dress. It reveals just too much at cleavage line and sides.


Love this dress! It fit perfectly and was comfortable.


The dress looks EXACTLY as the picture shows. The quality is a lot better than I expected for $24. However, I am rating it 4 stars because there are big time issues with the zipper! Considering many have complained about this issue I feel they should have addressed it by now, they haven't. Other than the zipper, the dress is wonderful. I bought it Saturday evening and it's Monday afternoon and I have it! It reaches the floor which is amazing because I am 5'8". I took a photo of the dress and the hem line to show the quality!!


This dress is very beautiful, some adjustments are needed though as it is very low cut and the straps are to long and slide off your shoulders. I am 5'7 ( the dress was too long) and 172 lbs, I bought a size 12 and it fit well accept above the waist was too large.


The dress is ok but it has these random spots that stick out oddly like around the bust and under the arms.  Other than that the dress is ok and the color is exactly as the picture has it.


I followed previous reviews and ordered up a size- dress was too big. However, I liked the dress and will be reordering in smaller size.


Cut is different and shoulder embellishments are pins that irritate your skin. You have to make sure the pins are even.


The color and style are spot on , it looks just like the picture. Very feminine. I tried it on right out of the package and


the skirt seems a bit poofy. I will steam before wearing it out next weekend.


Dress was exactly as described on the site. It fit perfect.  Only thing I didnâ€™t care for was the packaging it came in.  The plastic bag was not enough to keep the dress from being damage. A box would have been more suited for this.  But over all we loved the dress.


hoping to lose some wieght and maybe will fit better
