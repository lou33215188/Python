i chose the green dress and the color is really beautiful, the problem is that i measured myself and according to the size chart i chose the size 16, but when i tried it on it was practically 2 sizes too big!!!


You get what you pay for but it's not bad good coverage. Thick enough and very NICE FOR A SUNDAY DRESS BUT NOT A PROM. It would have to BLING IT up ALOT.


She loves the dress and it looks grea t! She is going to use it as a bridesmaids dres s?


A lovely dress for the price- but the top will fit women with smaller endowments better.


Fit is good


The dress is beautiful and fits great.


Very cute and pretty


The dress photo views & solid description of style & fabric gave me a good idea of how I should expect it to fit. Thanks again!


This dress looked just as advertised! I originally got a size that was too big for me, but the return was easy and hassle free. The only thing was the measurements. I may be measuring myself wrong, but I thought I was a 30 inch waist, so I got a size ten. Ends up the size six fits perfectly. So this dress may run large, or I'm measuring myself wrong. All in all a great dress!


I wore this dress on my husband's promotion ceremony and i received a lot of compliments..i really love it..thanks ever pretty..
