5'9" 160 lbs, sizing runs small so if you are a size 8 like me than go up a couple of sizes. Well made, extremely comfortable, loved the fit!


Wife bough these for her daughters at our wedding. They looks beautiful on them.


nice dress but too large


Loved the color and style when I ordered it.  I went by manufacturer sizing and it was too large.  In addition, fabric was flimsy and did not look good


Beautiful dress with great quality and good price. I am size xs and the smaller was a bigger for me, but I wanna say it is true to size.


Beautiful dress, it fit my gf like a glove. She was extremely pleased!


This dress cannot be beat for the price you pay. I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear and it fit like a glove. Perfect length, great material!


I always liked ever pretty dresses. I just wish the clothing material would be a little more heavy. Sometimes it tend to look a little cheap, but I still like them. So far I've ordered 4 dresses from ever pretty, and the 5th one is on its way! :)


I really liked the quality of this dress, but it falls way too small. I ordered a size bigger than I am and still couldn't close the zipper. It is not meant for women with bigger breast.


Don't waste your money. The material is really cheap and does not look like the picture
