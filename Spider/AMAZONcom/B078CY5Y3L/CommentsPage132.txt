I decided on getting this dress after being invited to a black tie wedding. I needed something quick and inexpensive. I was skeptical to order from amazon but i wasn't having any luck in stores. I originally bought this dress in a size 8 after reading a lot of reviews. Technically the 8 did fit me but in the rib area it was extremely tight and uncomfortable (of course, everyone's body is different). I am 140 pounds, 5'2 and 34DD. So i returned the 8 and got the 10. It was much more comfortable but I am getting the straps altered by my grandmother because they are a bit loose. It is long on me, but i'm going to wear heels so it doesn't matter to me.


For $30 I cannot complain. This dress is extremely flattering and doesn't feel cheap. The zipper isn't very smooth and is a little hard to work with but I can look past it because of the price.I would buy it again in another color if I had something to wear it to. 10/10.


I always enjoy Ever Pretty clothes they fit me to size.  That dress is beautiful and would like classic for my up coming cruise.


The color is beautiful but the bottom looked cheaply made.


I used the chart and ordered accordingly but was overall too large and I should've went with my true size that was one size smaller.


The fabric is a little loose, the center part is not structured, so it could fit badly.


Looked great on me.


We bought this dress for our daughter to wear as a bridesmaid.  It fit perfectly. We based her size using the measurement chart and it fit better than we thought it would. The price is great too.


Great dress for the price


I used the measurement scale before purchasing this dress and thought if anything it would be on the slightly too tight side. Unfortunately it is miles too big :-(


The dress was great. All aspects of this purchase was on target. Good quality, color and fit.  Kudos
