Affordable option for a long gown! Great for smaller-chested women. I ordered a 14 and had to get it hemmed 1 - 1 1/2", but it was well worth it. The crystal pieces for the shoulders are a little gawdy for my taste, but they are removable, so I plan to wear the dress without them.


Right color, wrong dress. This was for a party in 2 weeks and I can't wear the one that came.


Over all beautiful dress. Had to order a size 16 since 18 isnâ€™t available.


Pick your usual dress size. The size chart is wrong. But the dress is amazing. I had to get it fixed, but the material is wonderful


I really love the dress and the color is exactly what I expected, but I measured myself before I ordered it and it still fits a little strange. It was larger in the waist and chest than in the description. Either way it is a fantastic dress for the price!


I know own this in 2 colors - its a wardrobe must. Seriously, its a timeless dress!


You cant beat the price....quality surprisingly great!


hi. I just ordered the Maxi Dress 09016 but I need to change the size. I ordered size 8 but I want to changed to size 6. Thank you.


The dress fits as expected and is a great bargain!
