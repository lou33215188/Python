I love this dress. I'm wearing it for my son's outdoor summer wedding. It is very low cut but I was able to close that easily. Fits beautifully, beautiful on and comfortable.


Beautiful, fits just right.


The dress is pretty but I'm mad as hell because it won't zip the zipper is defective the dress fits but as soon as I take it off the zipper gets stuck....


This dress is very elegant, it fit perfectly, and it looks beautiful! Great dress especially for the price. Great quality fabric as well.


The dress fit like a glove-- I was almost afraid it was too tight on me, but I just had to have someone zip it up from the back to realize it was perfect. My chest is shapely, so I was able to fill it out without much trouble, though the hem of the top was a little annoying at the cleavage. Perfect for what I needed it for!


I bought this dress for a formal dinner. It was a little long, but perfect if you plan on wearing heels. The material was not cheap either. Very happy with it.


fabric is thin and weird.  extremely low cut!


Runs small!


Was packaged in plastic,. Had a minor funky smell to it that I will be getting it cleaned so that it doesn't continue to smell.  The zipper on the back was a bit difficult at first but after zipping it up and down a few times it went up smoothly.  Great Bargain for the quality of dress.  Loved the clips that go on the shoulders.  Will consider buying another dress from company in the future.


Upper half of dress is made too large for its size
