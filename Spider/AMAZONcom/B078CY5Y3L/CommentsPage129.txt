beautiful dress. I loved it.


I bought it for my sister and she was so happy!


Very happy with this dress arrived on time and perfect fit beautiful material would recommend to anyone


Sizes are pretty accurate but the torso of the dress is short so if you are tall and have a long torso the dress doesn't quite fit right.


Dress is really nice little big in chest but good fit every where else


Too large


Not good quality material.  I would not buy the product again


Love this dress


The dress looks exactly like  in the picture.


I like the quality as well.


Bought it  to wear at my friends wedding.


Very pleased


I ordered up a size to fit my large breast but being 5 feet 2 inches it is a bit too long, I'll need to have it hemmed.
