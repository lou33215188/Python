Fits great will buy another color


I got this dress today and tried it on and I love it. Its better than I exspected. Fits just how I wanted it too, good quailty material. and very clean and sheek......Im ready for Easter.


the material. but the dress look beautiful


I bought this as a bridesmaid gown and was very pleased. The size is exactly as advertised, and the fit is exactly how I pictured it from the images. Fast shipping as well.


I am 34E bust, 33' waist. I ordered the size twelve and the waist was tight but zipped up no problem but the bust area still had tons of room and the straps were too long (I'm short waisted so the straps probably aren't a problem for those with a longer waist. Also, I'm 5'6" and the dress was way too long. I would have had to do some serious alterations to make this work on me. The fabric is not as cheap as I was expecting, although you will definitely have to do some steaming to get all of the wrinkles out. It looks much nicer once the wrinkles are gone.


love this dress!! got many compliments. fit perfectly ordered my regular size


The color and the fit are exactly as expected. I am between sizes at the moment, and it fits when I am feeling fat and when I am feeling skinny.


I didn't know it was plus but Im going to wear it anyway. It does look like the picture. Ihave to wear high heels with it it's so long.


The first one did not fit right as I had not looked at the size chart to find out they run different then I am use to.  But he exchange was easy and the next one fit as expected.


Nice dress,am getting in black too
