I did like it, it fit me just right,the fabric feels ok, very summery.... its ok for the price.would recommended.


This dress is so pretty but I had to return the 4 and go up to a 6.  Once I did that it fit perfectly!


I am petite, but got the smallest size available. Still like it though.


Nice full, flowing skirt of the gown. Fits as expected. Perfect length.


It's a beautiful dress but I don't like that the thread is white and the dress color is aqua blue. It looks ugly.


Excellent


The dress fits a bit smug. But having an issue with the zipper


Cute I love it


No this dress does not fit me perfectly, BUT it only needs minor tweeking to make it look like something you paid 3 times the amount for. It will be the go-to dress for winter and summer for me. Comfy & classic. Reminds me of a black dress Charlotte wore to a wedding in the Sex & the City series. Can't remember whose wedding though. Hers was black and silk . .


very nice a little better than expected
