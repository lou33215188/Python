Great dress just not the right size


Love the fabric and cut of this dress, very beautiful dress but it was too small and long for my petite frame.


Love this dress fits perfect flows so elegant. I am very pleased.


The material is not good. Just use one time is ok.


Lovely and perfect. It really fits exactly if you choose the right size


Fit and length were perfect and arrived super fast.


I am happy with my purchase


Disappointed


Sizes run big.


The dress is see through.


Not a very pretty dress in general.


Make hips look very wide.


Wasn't what I expected. .
