Bought it because I have Lymphadema in one of my legs. And i can only were dresses or  skirts so I chose this one and I love them. Would I buy well I did in all diffrent colors


I really like this dress.  It's light and flowy.  It's very simple, but elegant.  I have a larger rib cage and decided to go up a size, it fits perfect.  Very happy with this purchase


Such a pretty dress! I loved wearing it. I did need to make an alteration at the bustline, and the construction easily allowed for the modification.


This dress is very cute and you can detach the jewels which is a great plus. But the V is so low, it was way too low for me to wear to an upcoming wedding.


beautiful


I took my measurements then picked my size which was very helpful! The dress looks just as it does on the website and it fits great. I am usually a sizze 2 but size 4 fits well. The dress is really affordable too. You can take the gold rhinestone pins off the shoulders or pin them anywhere on the dress.


Looks nice and elegant.


My entire bra showed under my arms! Poor fit, returned immediately. Honestly if you can go no bra it would be ok, still not awesome.


I tried on this dress.  Reasonably good fit.  Pretty much what I expected.  And I like the color.  Good buy for the price.


i am a size 8,, but I bought a size 10 because of the reviews where most people noted that the bust material doesnt cover properly(thats the style of the dress). so as i did not want too much boob action I went for a 10 and believe me it is the best decision ever.


cant wait to wear it for my baby sister's wedding.
