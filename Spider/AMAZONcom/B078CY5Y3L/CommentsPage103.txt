Just remember it runs long.


Beautiful dress and it fit perfectly!


It's pretty but just too small for a size of 34...it looks like size 30....sorry...


Really pretty and nice quality. It needed some adjusting on the top that was kind of low cut and too big.  The waist and length were perfect to size


not the best quality but of fabric but it fits good thank you


The cut is beautiful but the dress was not fancy enough for the black tie affair attending, will save it for another occasion.


This is a really low cut dress and when you hold it up to the light the top is see through meaning there's no lining in the front. Its a little lighter color than the picture but overall it looks cheaply made. Will be sending back.


Great dress and color for the price! Had to order a larger size but I cant wait to wear it for a wedding.


Came wrinkled and not true to size!


I wore this to a wedding and it is perfect!
