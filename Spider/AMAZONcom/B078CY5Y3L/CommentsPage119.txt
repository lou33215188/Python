This dress was exactly what I was looking for. The color is true to the photo (I ordered the dark green.) I'm 5'5", 125 lbs., 34C and I typically wear a size small (or a size 2-4 in dresses/pants.) This dress fit my bust and my height very well–snug but not too tight–and I didn't have to make any adjustments to the hemline.


It's not a radically fancy dress, but it worked well for the formal event I attended. I liked that the shoulder broaches were optional (I chose not to fasten them on the dress.) Overall, it's a good dress for a reasonable price.


It's ok. Not the best quality fabric or sewing but considering the price is ok.


The breast area is small considering I bought a size 10.


Overall is ok for the cost.


Way too small & also fell apart. We had to fix a few of the bridesmaid's dresses before we could even walk down the Ile because they were unraveling at the seams.


Was looking for a simple elgant dress that can be worn for occasions too. This dress was it..it fits perfectly but for a tall girl, I suggest to wear flats instead of heels as it looks somehow short when I got my heels on.. Glad I ordered it :)


A very nice dress for the price. I received many compliments.


This dress was delivered to me in such a small bag from dress maker. This dress is so poorly made and totally ugly.


The dress is gorgeous purchased it for my wedding, quick shipping arrived earlier then expected. Well done.


Quality is great, look is stunning , and color is just as shown!


I really like the color (I chose the coral). However, the material appears to be a little more cheap than I expected. I suppose for the price it is a nice dress but I expected more. Additionally, it is important to know that the plunge of the V is very deep.


The dress looks great !!


The seller meets his offer
