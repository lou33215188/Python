I'm always skeptical on ordering online.  This is a beautiful dress I'm a size 16 and I ordered an 18 which worked great.  I would have liked a 20. But dress was beautiful


This is a beautiful dress, especially in the blue.  It was a little snug so I had to return it.


fit as expected but bit long even with my 4 in heels and I'm 5'2


Beautiful dress


much too large and too long sent it back.  colors were nice


I love the dress! I bought it to use for a bridesmaid dress and it really is a pretty dress! I'm a size 4 normally and the size 4 fit perfectly. The only thing is the dress is really long, so I'm going to have to hem the dress a little, I'm 5'2". But besides that I love it.


Cheaply made. Returned.


Beautiful gown. Wore to a military ball and was perfect. Size up if you have thick chest.


This is a pretty simple evening dress but I really love it. It fit me perfectly and you can't beat the price. The sparkles on the shoulders are removable pins which I feel makes it more versatile.


I ordered the baby pink color of this dress in a size 10. It is a nice color and fits pretty well. The only problem I have is that it is a little large at the top. I wear a 38B, so I'm not large chested. Otherwise the length of the dress is perfect for my 5'7" frame. I will definitely be looking at Ever Pretty dresses for my next purchase.
