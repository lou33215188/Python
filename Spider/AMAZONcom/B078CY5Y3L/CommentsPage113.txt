I ordered the dress by the measurements provided by the seller photo and it fit perfectly. When I first tried it on it had a lot of static cling due to the material and arriving in a plastic bag, but that can be fixed with a dryer sheet.


Horrible dress, not at all alike the picture, I had to improvised at the last minute, a very y cheap fabric, horrendous dress.. never again buying from this seller...


I love my dress, I was a little unsure at the beginning because I wasnt sure if it would fit but the measurements chart is very accurate and it fit me perfectly! The fabric is very nice and the length too.


Thanks


The dress was received in unsatisfactory condition.  The dress had several damaged spots, located all around the dress.  We also did not receive the silver brooches shown with the dress. The dress was received in a timely manner but the condition of the dress was very disappointing.


Very pretty color. Purchased for a June wedding I am attending. Think it will be perfect. This company had a great selection of dresses at amazing prices. Don't like to spend a lot of money on something I won't be able to wear a lot.


I wore this dress in a wedding and i had a lot of compliments. Very happy with this dress. It fits very nice and you cannot beat the price. Thank you


Oh I really wish this would have worked. Decent construction, decent fabric, too many gathers for these hips. :(


The dress is well made and fits true to size.  The floral accented bodice and hem are dark, I was expecting it to be much more vibrant.  The dress is pretty, just not what I expected.


This dress is lovely.
