Excellent!


It didn't fit as it does on the model but that's probably on me. Item arrived on time.


Excellent design. Compliments figure and was wonderful for an all white wedding on the beach in Punta Cana.  All wedding party from bride, groom, attendants  and guests wore white.  Photos were divine.


Im a US SIZE 4, but this dress was too small. I returned and will order a size bigger. WIsh me luck!


Dress fit great and was perfect for the special occasion. Even though it was two layers the dress was thin and required a slip.


Fits great ,nice dress for the value , just the fabric underneath not too good, otherwise beautiful dress. I'd recommended .


Two small wrong color


sent back,but for a one time wear it would have been ok


Very nice


I bought this dress for an outdoor wedding.  It is beautiful dress and well-made.  The front is a little low and revealing, and will require some fabric tape for the event.  Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase!
