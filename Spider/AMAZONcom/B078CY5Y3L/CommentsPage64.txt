Overall it is very good for the price, no complain at all.


This was a wonderful purchase! I bought this dress at the last minute for my daughter's senior pictures. It was as described and was delivered on time. It was perfect for her photos. We will purchase from them again. The reviews and sizing chart helped with sizing.


Beautiful


Love it


For the price it is okay, but didn't love it.


My high school color. No complain.


This dress was very billowy. I wear a size 8 normally so I got a medium and I probably should have ordered one size smaller.  There is a lot of fabric in the skirt so I just felt like it was too pooffy.  The fabric was as pictured and the bright flowers really popped against the black.


I wore this to my brothers summer wedding and it was lovely! I felt comfortable but pretty and I really thought the colors were beautiful! I would only warn that under the arms go pretty low and so some creativity was required with concealing the bra.


It's larger than expected, even when I mesured myself and compare it to the chart. It is like a size bigger than what I expected, I'd recommend you buy your regular size. It is a very nice dress and the fabric is good and light. It's well made and looks nice.


I ended up returning this dress.  I am 5'6, 160 lbs and ordered a size 12.  The straps were too long, causing the chest area to hang much too low, it was also extremely long.
