Okay for $30, I was not expecting a dress as well made as the one I received. But it's made extremely well, fits perfectly, and is exactly what I need for my friend's fall wedding. Plus it's Prime so I received it in 2 days in case I needed to find a different dress! 10/10 would recommend


Fit as expected. Might be a tiny bit smaller but in general it was a great purchase.


It beautiful dress but too big don't look good at all

Beautiful dress. Neck line a little too low for me. I'm 36DDD so it was too revealing for me. Returned dress. Otherwise the dress itself is gorgeous if you like really low necklines.


It looks nothing like the picture. The colors are dull and is not suitable for a formal event at all. The rouching under the bust is poorly done, and the zipper gets stuck. I am not wearing this horrible dress anywhere. If you want to look well put together and fancy this is not the dress for you.


I am pretty busty. The dress itself fits, however my chest doesn't exactly fit in solely the chest area of the dress ğŸ˜�. Great color though.


This was a great dress for the price.  The bust area was too small for me so the dress was returned, but I would order it again if the occasion arises and I am not still breastfeeding!


Cheap cheap material. It's obvious it's manufactured quickly and without final inspection because the seams do not conform around an actual body. If you are looking for a bridesmaid dress or something for special occasion, stay away from this brand!! Should've known for the price.


I ordered the purple in an 8. Let me start by saying the color is lovely. But...I'm normally between a size 6 and 8 depending on the brand so I figured a size up was best. Yeah....no. I'm 5'7 and the length was perfect, barefoot or with low heels. The bust, well mine didn't fit. I'm a 34 dd and the 'cup' of the dress wouldn't fit over my boobs. The waist line bisected my chest instead of fitting underneath it. To me it felt like the straps weren't long enough, course it could have been my boobs are too big for this dress. At any rate, right at my bra is where the zipper refused to continue it's journey to close. I would be affraid to order a 10 because honestly the 8 chest was sooo small I don't think the 10 would fit and I don't want to wear tall heels by ordering a 12. It's really to bad cause it's very pretty.
