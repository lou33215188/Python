Bought this for my mom's wedding and it fit perfectly and the color was just what I needed


Very Impressed with this dress. Paying 30 for a simple dress that I can wear more than once!


I am 5'9" and I ordered a size 8. It was long enough to touch the floor and cover my feet.


This dress is very pretty and fits as expected. The only issue I have with this is that the gold shoulder brooches are too "yellow" and they look slightly different in person than they do on the model.


The dress is great and fits good but it was to long for me as I am a short person.


It it ok, has no stretch and has a very deep V line cut. It works, but is a little plain.


The dress looks elegant and the fit is perfect (make sure you use the sizing from the manufacturer's measurement chart on the left, which is included together with the sample pictures of the dress). The zipper seems a bit flimsy so be careful. Still a great dress, though! WIll buy more from this company.


This dress fits as expected and maybe even a little roomier in the chest area than I wanted. But then again I wanted to cover my belly bulge and it did that perfectly. Comfortable and pretty. I did wear a camisole under this as it was lower cut than I eanted and the armholes looped low.


Great formal dress for the awesome price! I wore this dress as a maternity dress (20 wks).


This dress was perfect and it turned a lot of heads.  It was flown and perfect for a dinner party.  I didn't have to suck in my belly after the big dinner:)


Pretty dress but would've needed to alter it to make it look great and I didn't have the time to do that so I returned it. This would be an economical bridesmaids dress if you have a tailor to make alterations.
