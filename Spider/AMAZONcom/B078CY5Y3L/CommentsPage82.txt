Was looking forward to the lovely sweep of a very full skirt on the dance floor but did not get it.


The color is lovely.  It is easy to wear and flatters the body but will not be the great fun it should be on the dance floor.


Good quality, especially for the price, and arrived quickly. Fit was smaller than expected particularly in the shoulder and chest.


I had ordered the dress not 100% sure on what size to order. I decided to go with the size 8 instead of the size 6 after reading some of the reviews. It did turn out to be somewhat too large, but I sent it back and I had just ordered the size 6. The dress was a good quality especially for the cheap price. The return was easy and free (which was even better). I would definitely recommend this dress.


Beautiful but just didn't fit. I'm a size 16 and the 18 wouldn't zip


I ordered it for our 20 year vow renewal and it fits perfect. I love it.


A little loose but it's very pretty! The material is nice, it has a linen/chiffon texture to it. It's the perfect length for me! I'm 5"7 140 lb, a size 10 was too big for me. I ordered it in white to be the casual wedding dress I'm wearing for my wedding party... I really love it ! It's casual but it doesn't look cheap at all.


The bust seam comes up too high.


Black floral dress is gorgeous. Well made. Very pleased.


Not as fitted as it seems in the picture but for the price I can't really complain all that much


The dress was exactly what I needed and fir true to size.  The only thing for me was the straps were a little long and I had to have them taken in so I wasn't falling out.  I received many complements on this dress.
