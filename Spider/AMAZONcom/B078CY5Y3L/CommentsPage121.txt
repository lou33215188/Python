The gold broaches on the shoulders are removable and that was a pleasant surprise. Everything about it was great. Light, comfortable, and still makes you feel glamorous.


I bought 2 of these dresses, one in green and one in yellow. I got so many complements from the dress. The only thing is that it's a bit big so you might need to have the dress altered if you're not busty.


I was the Matron of Honor in my friend's wedding and bought this dress. I normally wear a 14/16 so I bought both the 14 & 16 and returned both because the bust & shoulders were too big (36 D). I got the 12, which is really wacky, and it fit. You really can't wear a bra with it and it's really low cut. I tried it on again at 1:00 PM the day of the wedding and THE ZIPPER BROKE - the wedding was at 6:00 PM!!!  I had to rush out to David's Bridal and get whatever they had in my size in coral. Total nightmare.


Way too big. The top was too short for my long torso.


It was to large I made a mistake


I loved the dress and wore it for a formal Christmas party. I expected the red to be a little deeper, but I ended up loving the color.


this is a forever dress. if you are going to an outdoor even. this is your dress, very beautiful!! I celebrated my 50th birthday at a beautiful winery. This was dress number #2


Gorgeous! Fits amazing! Perfect for a wedding or just a night out. It's very well made!


We considered it for graduation but it would need a bandeau as the plunge neckline is quite low. Very pretty but a little blousy around the mid-section due to material gathers. We went with a more form fitting dress from the same company in ivory - both well price for the quality.


I love it
