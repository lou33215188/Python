The dress was still too small by about 2" in the bust & tight under the arms for sleeveless. Have to return it.


The dress overall was pretty. The color purple of the was perfect.  The dress fit until it van to the  bust area.


Dress was bought for a bridesmaid dress.... ran a little big but colour was great! was a little long so not really suitable for short persons


Not meant for those who have bigger than average boobs. But I still love it.


Fits beautifully.  Had to shorten it though because of my height.


Size and length are perfect. Not too long nor short. Material is too thin esp. the upper part. But overall, it's okay for me.

Fabric clings horribly. Couldn't even wear it. Looks and feels so cheap not worth the good price for it, buy something else.


Much cheaper fabric than expected


Too small. Design is on the small side.  Color was beautiful. Fabric excellent.  Bodice sits high on breasts, not the right fit for my body type as I am large brasted.
