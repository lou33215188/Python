IIt nice for the price


I brought it for a all white affair.  It was nice for the  occasion


Beautifully flowy and fun; great fit; for the price, you can't beat it!


Love this dress! Fits as expected, long enough and easy to wash. I'm definitely going to be ordering more dresses from Ever Pretty as it's my second one already :)


Great inexpensive dress to wear to my cousin's wedding.  I just wish the inner lining was the same length as the outside of the dress.  I kept having people tell me that I needed to pull down my slip :-(


Beautiful dress just a little to big for me and I couldn't wait for alterations


Just received my dress and my zipper was broke before I even tried it on ğŸ˜� Going to have to replace it before wearing it to a wedding


Gorgeous color. We returned it because the maid of honor did not prefer the cleavage. Use the size chart i. the photos.


love it! Fits perfect


So pretty!  It fits great and is very flattering if you're trying to hide your belly.  It's a bit long though.
