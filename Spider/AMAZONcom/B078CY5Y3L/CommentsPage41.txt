Very nice dress.


This is a very lovely dress. The back is in a "V" and stops mid back. I love the back! The front is nice. I followed their size chart and the fit was nice. But the actual style, i felt, didn't work for me. The skirt starts at the waist and flares out. It very flowy. Unfortunatly, I made my hips look bigger that what they are. I'm 5'6" at 140lbs. The dress just slightly touched the floor. I ordered the dress in Saphire Blue and the color is beautiful!


Pretty, but the straps are way too long- there was so much extra fabric, I had to return.


Great comfortable dress for the price


Not the best quality material nor was it cut well, it doesn't sit right on my shoulders and looks like a cheap dress from overseas.


This dress isn't for someone with a large chest who needs support.  The material is then and there isn't any padding or cups in the top so your nipples would show through.  You also can't wear a bra with the way the dress is cut.  If the manufacturer would just make some adjustments to the top this could be a nice dress.  As it is it seems more like a nightgown


Fit well and hit the ground being 6' tall (couldn't have worn heels, but flats would be fine). I ordered two dresses and liked the other better, so this one I returned.


This dress fit perfectly! I wear a 6 mostly, but in some things an 8, I ordered an 8 and it was perfect. I can't believe I found this good a fit for $40! And it's a beautiful green!


This was very tight in the bust and mine had another piece of fabric sewn in the cleavage area that wasn't in the picture


The dress is beautiful and looks amazing on.. I'm in between sizes.. 5"6 145lbs... 35/36 bust...ordered a size 6 was a little small on the top.. had to return... but beautiful dress:) will be getting a size 8:)
