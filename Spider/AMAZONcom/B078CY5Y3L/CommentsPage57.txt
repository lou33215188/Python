One star off because it is long, otherwise fits and is a decent quality and a great price.


Not true to size. The bodice was way to big and the skirt was knee length when the picture shows a floor length dress.


Awful material...worst dress ever


Works great! but looks cheap.


Loved this dress! I was nervous considering how cheap it was, but it fit perfectly. I will be wearing this to my friend's wedding and am so excited that I found the perfect dress for such a low price!


I love this dress but I had to return it since it wouldn't work for the wedding I'm going to. I wear a 40D in bras and the 14 was perfect. It does come very low but if I would've kept it I was planning on wearing a camisole under it. I will be ordering from Ever Pretty next time I need a nice dress and don't have a ton of money to spend


The dress is very pretty. A little low to wear a bra with. At 5'7" I found it was a bit short before I even put shoes on so I returned it.


Paid for overnight shipping and came when it said it would, which was a blessing because I used this as a bridesmaids dress and the other one I ordered never came! Fit beautifully and was the exact color I needed. Pretty fabric, very comfortable.


Nicely made dress. Worked well as bridesmaid dress. Very low cut, wish it had a built in bra/support. We sewed in a piece of lace for modesty panel. Would describe as lilac


Not as described. Good thing I can sew...
