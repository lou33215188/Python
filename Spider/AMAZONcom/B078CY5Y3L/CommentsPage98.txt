it's a very pretty dress, but a bit too small.  and the medium was too big.


Doesn't fit around my bust and it is big other places.


I fell in love with this dress, but the zipper was poorly made and kept getting caught even when it is not being worn.


It is beautiful but the size is too small.  I hope to get a larger size. Seems to be made well


Beautiful gown... I'm 5'6 and it was very long(which is what I wanted)! Great price!!


Amazing bridesmaid dress!!! Cant beat the price


I love this dress! It was perfect for my friend's wedding!


This dress was adorable but was a bit too large.


My maid if honor looks absolutely gorgeous and the fit is exact. The tailoring is excellent and the dress is sown very well.


Beautiful dress. The fit and fabric were wonderful, BUT it was too short. Sadly had to return it for that reason. I wish I could find it in a longer length! (I'm 5'9")
