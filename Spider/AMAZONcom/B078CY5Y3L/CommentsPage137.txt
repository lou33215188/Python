Very pretty dress BUT the waist falls funny and making my hips big


It was a tad big but nothing a few altercations can't fix.  I think it is really pretty and worth the money


My 15 year old daughter found this dress in Amazon, and I was kind of skeptical about the dress quality as well the sizing and measures.  As soon as the dress arrived, my girl put it on and  I was amazed about how this dress fits and looks.  My girl loves it, as the price is great!


The only con is the length, since I think even for me would be very long.  I will have to tailored it.


Quality was exactly as described, but I expected that at such a price! I did have to sew the neckline up a little, but only because I am on the larger size cleavage wise.


I was okay didn't fit like I wanted it to.  Didn't wear it. had to order something else to wear.


This was a gift for my niece to wear to the prom. She decided to wear a different dress though.


The delivery was fast and it fit perfectly. Happy customer.


Runs small but good evening dress


I like the material


The dresses are beautiful.  The color in the picture is very accurate to what it looks like in person.  I can't believe how inexpensive these dresses are!
