I ordered a size based on the size chart, but when the product got there it was much too large to fit as expected. I returned it.


Was too open in the front for my needs, otherwise was a lovely frock.


The dress is really pretty. I'm 5'1 and it runs a little long, but that is to be expected. As other reviewers have said, it runs on the small side. The fabric is lovely and the cut is flattering. My only issue are the zippers which are awful. For the price, I am pretty satisfied.


it was 2x smaller than the actual sizes


I purchased this for use at an upcoming event that I attend annually (and don't want to wear the same dress every year).  I didn't want to spend tons of money, and the dress looks nice, and will fit the bill.  I am thinking about shortening it to cocktail length after the event to use as my "little black dress".


this dress is not flattering at all it looks so nice on the model but it makes me look like i have no figure


Delivered as promised! Dress arrived a little wrinkled but it was very easy to fix.Great material, very soft and comfortable. Perfect length, true to size. I personally loved the color, received plenty of compliments. I wore it to a dinner Gala Party! I would purchased again from this buyer. thank you!


Returned due to size running large. Also the V neck runs very low, as well as too revealing on the sides of chest.  Perhaps because it was a bit large, but I think even the smaller would still be too revealing for my task.


Nice


For the most part this dress is nice. I haven't had an occasion to wear it yet, but I'm sure I'll find one.


The material is rougher than I expected, I don't know my materials that well to know before hand what it was going to be like.


The top is a little big on me but the waist was the correct size.
