Awesome dress for the price. Material looks cheaper in person than in the picture and needs ironing, but it fits perfectly.


Too big for small size, fabric is not quality. I won't order it any more. You have to change the quality of fabric


I didn't buy this for any particular event, I just like the look of maxi dresses. This is well lined and hangs nicely. Doesn't feel cheap.


love it... great price!


Too long for me (I'm 5'2")


Loooooooved this Dress! i worn it for a wedding last Saturday and it was just stunning!  -- Perfect Length and Color is as shown on image.


Will continue buying from this buyer.


its ok


Dress is beautiful.  Have a little issue with the zipper catching when trying to zip up myself.  Need help getting into it, but other than that, I like the dress


Pretty.


Good
