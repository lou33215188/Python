The dress fit perfectly. Just a little long for my height (5'3"). This was an amazing deal! Just needs to be hemmed and ironed. Would recommend!


this was my daughter's prom dress absolutely beautiful comfortable flatering received many compliments no one had this dress


The dress fits as expected, it's just seems to be made for a taller person, however it served its purpose for the day.


Returning it.  It's nothing like the picture.  Just horrible.


Perfect fit! Not a size larger or smaller was needed. A decent length, once paired with heels. I love the color and the material. A really beautiful dress! I am very happy with my purchase.


Pretty dress, runs small.


The dress fits lovely! It is defiantly true to size by the chart they give!


I dont give it a full 5/5 stars just because of the length of the dress!


I am 5'5 and the dress length fit just about right above my toes. out of all the dresses that are long they are always made for people that are like 5'8. I just wish it was longer so that I could of hemmed it, if its too short I cant make it longer.


everything else is great!


It looked too cheap.


Even though it was a little larger than expected, it could have easily been adjusted with minor alterations. Unfortunately the color I ordered did not arrive as expected - it looked much lighter/brighter on the computer monitor. But it was still a decent quality, nicely fitting dress.


I purchased this dress for a wedding and it exceeded my expectations. Beautifully crafted and I didn't even have to spend an arm and a leg. I ordered it 2 days before the wedding and was at my door the next day. I did end up sewing the front cleavage up about 2 inches cause the cut was very low but you couldn't even notice that I had stitched it. Will wear this dress again. Thank you amazon and everpretty!
