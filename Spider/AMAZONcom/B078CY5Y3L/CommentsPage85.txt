This dress was beautiful and exactly what I was hoping for. Fit perfectly and the material is great. Highly recommend


terrible construction and cheap fabric


The top half is a little weird if you are more well endowed. But overall it worked out and got these for my bridesmaid dresses. I do appreciate the free returns because they do run small, about one dress size.


It would have been a great dress if It was sewn properly in the back


I'm usually a 2-4 and it JUST FITS!! It's a very lovely dress and I'm pleased but there's no wiggle room from the rib cage to the bust. Can't wait for an occasion to wear it. Would order from seller again


I still can't believe this dress was $25 its beautiful !!


Color was fine, just didn't fit well in the bust line.


Wore it for my contemporary backyard bohemian type wedding. Was flattering


The length is too long for me but it fits right.


Cute dress but I am 5'2" and weight 110 and it was a little big and very long even with high heels.
