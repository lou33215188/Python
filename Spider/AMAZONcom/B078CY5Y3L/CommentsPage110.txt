this dress is very plain and simple, if this is what you are looking for then this is perfect.


too revealing.


Lovely color (purple), drapes beautifully past the waist.  I went up a size based on what folks were saying about the bust, and that seemed to work well for the most part, although it's a little gape-y on one side... Nothing a little altering can't fix though, and for the discounted price I got it for, I'd say it was quite a steal!


A little big in the chest but fits according to size.


I loved this dress!! I highly recommended the dress, The dress fit perfectly,except for the top. The top was slightly big but I was able to adjust it with the Brooches. I ordered the dress on a Thursday and received it on a Monday, thank you for the fast delivery!


Beautiful dress. Nice fabric, cheap zipper.


This dress is so beautiful and i like the length and the material. Can be worn for special occasions too.


For the price this is a great steal.  40 dollars for an evening dress is great especially since I had to act fast for a last minute event.  Sizing is smaller.  I'm rather smaller in the chest area, so my size was okay.  If you are a little larger you may want to go up a size for fitting purposes.


they looked really beautiful on they where perfect for my sisters wedding


I love the dress.  However, I purchased a dress from David's Bridal in a size 12 and therefore purchased this one in the same size but it was a little big.  However I am bottom heavy so that plays into the awkward fit up top.  I am 5' 2" and with 4 inch heels it barely touches the floor.
