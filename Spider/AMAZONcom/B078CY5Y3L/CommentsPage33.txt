A pretty, comfortable and very usable dress. The material looks more silk-like in the photo, but it's more of a thin mesh fabric. It's still great and I look forward to wearing it.


This dress is beautiful and amazing quality especially for the price. I purchased this for a formal event and it fit my 6 month belly perfect. I ordered a size 6 (pre pregnancy 2-4) and it was perfect except it is very long. I am 5â€™5â€� and had to shorten it about 2 inches. Despite the length issue for me, i would absolutely recommend this dress.


I ordered this dress for a wedding and let me tell you.....this company had FANTASTIC customer service.  I ordered the dress with standard shipping, then realized it may not arrive in time for the wedding.  I emailed the company, and they upgraded me to expedited shipping FREE of charge.  It was awesome.  As far as the dress itself, I was excited when it arrived.  The colors are exactly like the picture and it's nice quality material.  It did come folded up and tightly packed into a sack, so it was pretty wrinkled.  No problem to let it hang and use wrinkle-releaser.  Only problem - the dress was much to big in the bust area.  I am 5' 7 1/2" tall and weigh 165#...... I ordered a size 12.  It was great length-wise, but with my normal bust size the top of the dress was falling off and it did not fit tightly to my chest.  Therefore I had no support and it was obvious.  I was not able to wear a bra to offer support because it would have been visible with the very low cut V-neck front.  I didn't mind how low cut the front of the dress was, but because it was too big it really looked bad on me.  I have also had 2 children and nursed both of them, so I need a little extra support in the bust area of my dresses now.  I am currently 38B.  If you have large breasts, you might be fine when purchasing this dress.  Otherwise, if I had time, I might have tried to exchange for a size 10 instead to see if the smaller size would fit better.  In my case, I returned for a refund.


I was looking all over for something in this color for a wedding in general I liked the dress I just wish it would have been a little more form fitted on the top half of the dress and where it is supposed to be gathered in the front it didn't lay properly so it was hard to keep from showing my bra and my chest because it was loose material. Other than that I liked the way it flowed at the skirt and I will wear it again but, will have it altered to do that first.


I bought this as a bridesmaid dress for a friends wedding this summer. The shipping was so quick, which was great! The dress fit as expected, I would stick to their sizing chart. The quality is fantastic, and you canâ€™t beat the price! Itâ€™s so flattering, I cannot wait to wear it!


I'm 13 and i wanted a dress for homecoming. The smallest was 4 and i wasn't sure it would fit I thought it would be big. (I'm only 5'1 and 103 pounds). I was so wrong. It was about 4 inches longer than me so it runs quite long.


It's stunning


The quality is so amazing to be only 25 bucks. If you have any questions please leave them for me I'll try my best to answer ğŸ˜Š


Beautiful! Exactly what I what I wanted and for a great price!


Lovely dress! I wore it to a friend's wedding and thought it looked classy. I am 5'8'' and usually weigh about 160 lbs. At the time I had lost some weight (10 lbs.) and so the dress was a little big in the bust, but I am sure it would have fit my usual size well. It was flattering for my tummy and not too revealing.


Dress looks exactly like in picture. Size 6 fits well. I'm 5'8 and 145 pounds. I have a narrow waist and small rib cage and that is where the fit of this dress matters. It flows loose at hips which is good for me as that is where I have curves. The chest panels fit ok, could be a little tighter but not bad. But i do wish the straps were tighter on shoulders. However my back and shoulders are small so this is a common issue for me. Fabric is nice. Length just brushes floor in bare feet so I prob will not choose too high a shoe. Looks lovely on(just on quick "make sure it fits" trial) So I am sure it will get compliments when wearing for the real deal event (wedding)


This dress is incredible, especially for the $35 price tag. I used the size chart provided and read the reviews before ordering. My dress fit perfectly, and I found the material and make of the dress to be of high quality. It does not have a cheap feel, and I see no immediate issues.  Bought this for a friends wedding, and I cannot wait to wear it. Some previous reviews stated issues with the zipper. I have not noticed any issue with this on my dress.
