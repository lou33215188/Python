Very small and see-through. There is a knee-length slip underneath that shows through, which I did not like.


Needed this last minute for a gala. The fit was about as expected except in the bust. Luckily, everything else was wonderful! The fabric was as expected and it look very expensive! I was a hit and it was because of this dress! A Must Buy!


Not even close to my dress size.


This dress ia elegant and has a low v neck without showing too much, its perfect!! The only thing that caught me off gaurd was the color. I chose red, expecting it too be a dark red /maroon like the picture showed but I got a regular red colored dress.  I still love it, but the pictures should be more accurate.


Pretty dress but too big in the bust


The dress was exactly what I wanted and expected...it came promptly and fit perfectly. It was really good for the price. Thank you.


Pretty dress, somewhat smaller that a normal dress this size and the front is WAY too low cut if yo have any kind of bust at all it will need to be pinned or sewn together.


I typically wear a 6, but I ordered the size 8. I would recommend ordering one size larger than you typically wear. It was a beautiful dress


Had them altered for a wedding,  but they were lovely dresses,  not the highest quality,  but they were fine for our occasion, and budget!


This dress fit is sooo lovely and the fit was perfect Only one BAD thing! Its tooooo SHEER! you can see right through it!


Do not buy anything light colored from this line. dark colors are no Problem! thinking about sending it to a Seamstress.
