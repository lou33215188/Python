Its a pretty dress and well made. But they shipped me the wrong size!


I originally ordered a size bigger and it was way too big. the size 10 fits perfectly. beautiful dress. Wore it to an outdoor wedding, felt great. definitely recommend.


Nice dress just not made for a short person


I like this dress.  I think the quality for the price is tremendous. BUT - it gaps funny in the bodice.  I think I'm going to have it sewn closed, a snap, something.


The dress looks pretty and the quality is good. The accessories for the shoulders come separately which is good to prevent any damage on the fabric.I ordered it following the picture measurements like they suggested but it didn't fit. Unfortunately I had to return it.


Bought for my wedding dress.  Fit beautifully, was well made and I got many compliments.


It was pretty if it fitted. The material is light. It is a little cheap feeling


Love it! Looked so beautiful. Got it for my cousin for her engagement photography session. Will post a picture later when I get the photographs. It's true to size!


fit my niece perferct!


One of the pleats in the back wasn't sewn in, so it lays oddly by the zipper.  I think a couple of hand stitches will do the trick. For the price, it is very pretty.
