Bought this dress in white, thinking I'd wear it for my casual wedding. No way! Length and shape are decent, but it is practically transparent! You could see EVERYTHING underneath it. The straps/top are floppy and allow for side and cleavage peeks, too. The pretty gold bits on the shoulders are removable brooches that are quite large and stick out awkwardly no matter how they are pinned on!


If I hadn't found another, similar dress for just a bit more, I could have made this work by shelling out lots of money to alter the bodice and add a full lining, and possibly adding some shoulder details that actually work. Not worth it!


nice dress!


The dress fit great according to the size chart. Still too long for me but evening is.


A little bit too tight for the size. Cheap wrapping. Very wrinkled and will need a lot of ironing. Front and back too low.


Very good


The dress is just as described! Very elegant and flowing. My daughter is wearing to her prom. Beautiful and fits great!


I love it!! It looks great.


Very good fit. I am usually stuck between a 6 and an 8 so I chose to be safe and get the 8 and I am glad I did because it fits well and is not too tight. The material is very nice and does not feel cheap which is perfect because I am using this as a bridesmaids dress! I would order from this company again for sure.


It was hideous. I guess I should've known by the price, but it was totally transparent and looked soooooo cheap.


After ordering a dress from another website for my casual wedding and it arriving looking NOTHING like the picture, I was a lil apprehensive ordering another dress onilne..but I figured its cheap, has glowing reviews and I can return it so why not? So happy I did. Looks like dresses that cost four times as much from a bridal shop.
