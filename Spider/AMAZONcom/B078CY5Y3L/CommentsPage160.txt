Purchased this dress for an event. Tried it on, fit fine. Got dressed for the event, (2 days later) the zipper would not go up, then it eventually broke. Not happy at all.


Perfect for my wedding on the beach


I ordered the white one with black patterns. Absolutely love how it looks and feels- I'm pairing it with bright red accessories for my wedding in the fall. I'm 5'6 145lbs and the medium was a perfect fit!


Pretty dress, not for my body type, gave to my boss who loved it.


this dress looks so pretty in the picture. i was very disappointed when i received it. the bodice straps are so short that the waist band comes way up on my chest.


Beautiful gown. Got it in both the green and purple. Having trouble choosing which color to keep! They are both lovely. I wish the gown were a little higher in the front and the back - I will have to tack it a bit in the front and add a hook or two in the back, above the zipper. I ordered a size 16 - I am not a tiny woman, but I think the gown looks as good on a plus sized person as a slimmer woman.


I got the dress in green (not emerald green but just green) and it was gorgeous!! Ordered size 12 per the measurements on the chart and looked great. Wore it to a gala and got plenty of compliments. It is low cut in the front and back so have a plan for bust support if you are a DD, like me, I spent an entire day trying to find a bra that wouldn't show!


Good quality material


Very pretty


the print, color and cloth is not what i expected as shown in the picture and it's too long even if i'll wear a 4" high heels
