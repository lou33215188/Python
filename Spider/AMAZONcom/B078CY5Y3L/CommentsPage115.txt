I love the color, it fits perfectly.  The fabric is not as soft as I expected, but is still nice.

The bust hangs quite a bit and the neckline is too low for my liking.


Love the look.  Will look even better once steamed.  Need to lose a few pounds....lol..but got til Oct


From the reviews I played it safe and ordered two sizes up and good thing I did. If you're busty do go up two sizes and if not I'd say just go up one size. The quality is superb I can't believe that the dress is only 24.99 with free shipping! I'll have to have the sleeves shortened but aside from that all else is perfect length, color, and fit. Don't hesitate to purchase you definitely won't regret it. I'll add a photo at a later date.


The dress fit perfect to size. The only thing that I had a problem with, was that the zipper was plastic and should have and needed to be metal. And the arm cut was cut way to low. It should have fit closer to the armpit. You can see the bra when you lift up your arms. That's tacky!


This looks like an evening gown in the photo but it's actually a cheap polyester dress. If it was $20 or less it would be worth the money.


Dress was extremely long.


After reading the reviews, I was afraid the chest area would not accommodate my DD's.  No problem, the dress fit great.  I ordered according to the charts.
