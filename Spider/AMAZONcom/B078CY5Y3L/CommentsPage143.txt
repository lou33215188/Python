Sizing is a little large, but it still looks great. Love the way it feels and the colors are beautiful.


looks better than i thought it would for the price, but runs a bit tight at the zipper. decent value, though.


This is a very good fitting dress. I would recommend it to anyone, it's great for the price & it's true to fit.


Great dress for a great price. Shows a lot of cleavage. Not for the modest.


This dress fit as expected. The colours are absolutely radiant! It can be worn at a wedding or dressed down for a nice evening lime.


Product fits perfectly and looks as elegant on as in the picture! It shipped within two weeks and it was worth it!


I got it for my wife. She's 5'7 140 pounds, Size 8 was just perfect. The blue color is a little too bright but still a nice dress for the price,


my halloween costume

This dress is beautiful on.  it fits great too.
