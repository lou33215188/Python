I ordered 2 sizes an 8 and 12 since 10 was out of stock. Size 12 was way too large. Size 8 was a little snugg in the boob area but manageable. The size 10 would have been ideal


Beautiful dress, fits perfectly with good quality.


Love it...I was nervous to order online but it is a great dress.


Color is true.  Easy to wear on all body types.


Very little alteration needed.  Fit chart true to size.


Thank you!


This dress is probably best for women with little to know curves. It was not flattering on me, fitting me tight in some spots and too loose in others. Returned this one and bought another one from the same company which was perfect. Free returns! Which is vital when buying clothing online.


It is a beautiful dress, just slightly too small. The 16 is more of a 14.


its a little long, 5'1 and the dress would needed to be taken up about 4 inches


This dress is beautiful!!!! Great quality and it flows perfectly!


Nice and I get compliments from many people.


Too much gathering in ribs resulting in it making me look wide. Returning
