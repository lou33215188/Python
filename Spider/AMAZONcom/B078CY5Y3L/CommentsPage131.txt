Beautiful color and fit!  Great value for the price! Easy to dress up or down.


Followed the size chart and the dress was to small. The dress it self is beautiful but to small. I would go up a size from the size it recommends.


The front does not ruffle like the back at the waist. I should have ordered a size 14  instead of a 16. I  love the color and the way it flows.


This dress is very elegant. Im a plus size and this model is exactly what I need. No complements! I got it in time, the same as the picture, all OK. Just say thanks for your efficient work.


Ran small


Very Good.


I received the beautiful dress so I gave 4 out of 5 stars because the material is so thin but it looks nice. :) The chart measurement image is accurate as I expected to fit.


The dress was too small in the bust and waist area. Pretty but didn't fit. Love the color and material too!


Beautifully fit


Beautiful dress but runs very small.  Sending back. ğŸ˜•
