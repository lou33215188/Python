Fits true to size. I am 5' 9" and the length is perfect !!


Ordered a size 4 but received a 6 -- thankfully it ended up being okay for my purposes. The chiffon is INCREDIBLY static-y though, and I can't figure out why.


Gift for daughter; she loved it.


It's ok for the price.  I'm tall and found it a little too short with heels. I did get compliments on it and it was nice but not a show stopper dress.


The straps were long, but otherwise the dress fit well. The zipper sticks a bit, and is difficult to close on your own.


I followed the size chart to order my dress.  When I got it, I had to bring it to tailer for resize the chest because it was too big to me.  I wore it in a wedding, and lots of friends commented that I looked so great in the dress.  Even thought I have to go to my tailer to resize the dress, I still like it overall.


the measurements are NOT sized to listing. I measured before ordering and bust area does not fit. only to find out they do not even sell 18!


I made a few alterations made to it. And Everton loved it!!


A bit of an issue in getting the dress, wrong dress was sent at first but when I talked to customer service they were very nice and helpful and I got the correct dress in the mail a day later. Dress is just like the picture an exactly as I expected, fits perfectly (is a bit long for me as I am a 5'2" gal, but that is expected in every item of clothing I buy).


The fabric is thick and doesn't feel too cheap. The zipper feels incredibly cheap and I am afraid it may break when I zip it up. Other than that, this dress met my expectations
