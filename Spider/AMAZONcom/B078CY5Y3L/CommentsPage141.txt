size chart inaccurate


I love it look good on me. Thanks!


The dress was exactly as I expected and therefore perfect!


V IN CLEAVAGE AREA DIP TOO LOW AND IT'S NOT TRUE TO IT'S SIZE.


I ordered a size larger and it was still too small. Time to return.


The color was beautify and the dress was okay. This dress was about six inches too long (I'm short) about four inches longer that a regular length dress. And if you are bigger than a B cup forget it. The lenght and the bust issue are some thing all Ever Pretty dresses seem to have in common.


Beutifull dress


Loved the dress, arrived on time & well packaged. Saw other reviews about the top running small I think it was actually a little big but easily fixed.


My Second Changing Gown Which Is This One Is Beautiful On Me


Perfect for my formal night on cruise. Fits perfectly.
