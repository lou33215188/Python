I usually wear a size 12, and ordered a size 12.  The dress fit as expected in the bust, waist, and hips, but I am 5'9" and the dress was hanging a good 3 inches off the floor which was not a good look.


The  fit was great and accurate to re size chart. I am 5'1, 120 lbs with DDD chest and ordered a medium and it fit perfectly! It is a bit long for me but easy to hem or one could just wear heels. I am wearing this as a brides maids dress in a wedding and would certainly suggest this to anyone, intact I suggested this dress shop to the other brides maids.


didn't fit right


A lovely fit and nice material. It's long on me (I'm 5'3"), but that's normal. I needed a nice dress I could breastfeed in, it will work perfectly for a wedding I'm going to soon.


Does not fit on your body as pictured. don't waste your money.


A lovely dress.....Looks EXPENSIVE...Made me feel like a princess!


I wore this for a wedding and felt like I was going to expose myself. I had to safety pin the front closed. I guess it might work for a woman with a very small chest.


Firs exactly as it should. It's long on me but I am only 5'2" so I expected that. Definitely best for smaller busted women as it is low cut.


For the price, beautiful dress.  Runs small.  I ordered a size up after reading reviews, glad I did!


Very beautiful dress. My niece liked so much, thanks
