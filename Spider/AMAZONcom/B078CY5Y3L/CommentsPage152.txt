The dress is very pretty and elegant for such a low price.  I used the measurements given but it is still a little big.


Dress is cut small and very low cut in the front.


Fits and looks great!


Recommend the dress to turn heads.  Color - dark purple matched description when I opened.  Length of dress great with 3" heels for my 5'3" height.  Beware though if have a large bust.  Dress is made for 36" and smaller figure size.  I recommend not wearing a bra to have more room in the dress.  Back of dress similar to the front and is very sexy low V cut.  Fabric see through, yet has an inner silky lining.  I absolutely love this dress for the chic A type flowing style and dark purple color.


Dress was really pretty and the crystal pins for the shoulder was nice also. Unfortunately I ordered a size too small. The area under the arm pits is exposed so consider that when ordering. Shipping was prompt. Will order from Ever Pretty again.


The dress is nice but I found the embellished pins that attach to the straps a little awkward.  Otherwise it fits well.


Beautiful dress & such a great price!!!!
