This is a GORGEOUS dress!


Fits like the size chart. Very beautiful material and good quality as well.


This is a beautiful dress but doesn't flatter my figure (pear shaped).  I would recommend it for nearly any other body type.


great dress, it was long and had to be hemmed but for the money you can not beat it!


... and no one knew it was a dress I'd bought online, on Amazon for a very good price.  It was perfectly elegant.  It showed off my cleavage and hid my butt.  What more can a woman ask for?


I'm a DD and it was just a bit loose up top.  No padding up top.  True to color.  I got the maroon color.  Shoulders have a neat ring of fabric across strap to dress it up a bit.  I need the padding up top but really like the dress overall.


Wore this dress to a wedding with "formal" dress code and got so many compliments! The fabric is not the highest quality but it is more than adequate especially for the price.  It does not look or feel like a "cheap" dress! The print is gorgeous and you will feel so regal in it.


Dress was a good quality. They do run big. Im usually a size 7 or 9 in (Medium in juniors). And got a size 10 and it fit perfect. Defenetely super long, had to have it hem but overall good.


The dress fit bueatifully... except in the chest area. It appear this dress was made for a slender woman with massive breasts! Now, mine are not small but the chest was so loose that I had to have it altered. Other than that it was a beautiful dress


listen for the price you cant go wrong yeah its a little too low on the vneck but with the pins it comes with thats no biggy its beautiful fits amazing im using it for my wedding ....bought a wedding sash seperatley and together with the dress it lookks like i spend 100 when i really spent only 35$ together give this dress a shot!
