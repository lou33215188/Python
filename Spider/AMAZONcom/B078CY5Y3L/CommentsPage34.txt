I spent enough on my last "event" dress that I decided to order this to have on hand for the next one. It was a great price, and it's a lovely color and flattering fit. It's not amazing, but it will get the job done the next time without having to spend $400+ on a dress + alterations, or forking over $100 or so for a Rent the Runway dress.


Was too much clevage for the wedding event I am going to.  Length was super long, but was wearing to beach wedding with no shoes.  Pretty color


I saw that the dress ran slightly small so I ordered a size bigger and it fit perfectly. I wore it to prom and got so many compliments, I love love love this dress.


This dress is gorgeous! I ordered a 10 and I'm currently wearing a 10/12 and is a little tight in te back area but still love it.


Dress is beautiful. No one can believe the price for how gorgeous it is. A little long for my 5'2 self even in 4 inch heels.


This dress fits perfectly. Stunning. I'm 5'10", weigh 147 lbs. Wear a 36DD, and it fits like a perfect size 10.


For the price, you can't beat it!  It's long but I'm 5'3" and 135lbs and the size 6 fit great.  I did have to have it altered due to being to long but it didn't cost that much.  I highly recommend this dress.


This dress is great except that it's about a size too large on me. If you're debating between getting a bigger or smaller size, get the smaller size. This dress looks better when it's a tighter fit. Other than the size issue, the dress is fine.


This was a great dress! Quality looked good and fit perfect on me - I got a small, 5'6" 125lbs. I received a halter top dress instead of the picture but I loved it more! looks very similar to bridesmaid dresses today but I did have to sew up the neck line a little because it was way tooo low.
