The dress is very pretty and it fits very nicely to. No complaints!


I love love love this dress. the measurements are true to size! Every loved the dress for  the wedding and wished they had the braidsmaids wear it instead of what was picked out.


I am 5'5 and 137lbs and 34B. I found the 8 to be too big on the top and ultimately returned it. It is really nice though and I would've altered it just to keep it if I had time.


This dress is gorgeous and perfect for my son's wedding. I am short so I have to get it hemmed, but everything else fit perfectly.


Purchased for my wedding. A great fit. Just measure as instructed. I did make a tack stitch in the front cause it was pretty low v neck. But I absolutely love this dress.


Fit perfectly


love the fit, cut & length! Perfect, thank you!


Great value, just didn't like it on me.


The dress is beautiful but it runs a little small, better order a size up, as it doesn't stretch at all.


Thank you
