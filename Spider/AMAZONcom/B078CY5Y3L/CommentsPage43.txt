I found the cut of the dress to be not flattering on me...  I am sure it would look better on more full figured or busty women.


It was ok, i just didnt like the way it fit on me so had to return it


Beautiful dresses and lovely color. Just as expected. Better quality fabric and construction than I expected as well. Would highly recommend.


ğŸ‘� good


About 6 inches too long for my daughter, who is 5'3". Getting it hemmed was 3x the price of the dress. Would not recommend for anyone shorter than 5'9".


beautiful dress, chest shows to much had to be altered


Very nice, I love it.


Im 5'5, and bra size is 34D. and I ordered size 6. fits perfectly well. and I love it. length was perfect too.


I am 5'6, about 150 to 160 pounds and I bought a 12. It was too big on top ( i pinned it tight to give it its desired look) and left a lot of space in the waist area. I should have bought a 10, but a quick trip to the tailor will fix it, Beautiful dress!


probably about a size too small. returned
