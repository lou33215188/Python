I really love this dress. Perfec for me


Run a little bit small but good.


Brides maids where beautiful. It was a comfortable dress and fit nicely!


I really liked the dress. it was exactly what was described online. The only thing i found was it was slightly bigger than I wanted, but nothing a seamstress couldn't fix. I highly recommend this dress to anyone looking for a evening dress or a bridesmaid dress!! And for the price, you cant beat it..


Besides running small, the dress is lovely.


I wore this to a black tie event and it was perfect. I am 5' 2 , 120 lbs. I ordered a size 4 and 6 because I wasn't sure. The size 6 fit perfectly and I had no trouble returning the size 4. Highly recommend if you are looking for elegant and sexy.


Exactly as described. LOVE it!


Beautiful dress.  I highly recommend this dress


I needed an affordable gown for upcoming event and purchased this.  Its a little big, I may have it taken in. But it is comfy and the fabric is okay.  Not as long as I would like but that is okay too.  I am happy with the purchase.


Was long, but I had it hemmed and loved it!


Gorgeous dress. Ordered this and another Ever Pretty gown for a spontaneous wedding. I ended up going with the other one, but this dress is beautiful, too!
