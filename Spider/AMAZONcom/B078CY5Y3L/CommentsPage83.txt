I really DON'T like ordering clothes on line since they usually don't fit right.  BUT after reading the reviews for this beautiful dress, which I took their advice by buying a size smaller, I was pleasantly surprised the dress fit PERFECTLY!!!! The material drapes just like in the picture and is true to the color in the picture too.  It will be perfect for my daughters wedding!! THANK YOU!!!


Great value! I'm not sure if I am going to keep this yet but as far as fit goes, fits perfect and a great bang for your buck.


Just love this dress.  This will be my third Ever Pretty Dress.  Fit is nice - its lays right and the flowers on this dress are so bold an beautiful.  Does not look like a low budget dress at all.  LOVE this dress. Be advised for a voluptuous woman on top, it fits decently but is very low cut both in the cleavage and under the arms.  But for the cleavage, nothing a camy or pretty flower matching the existing flowers couldn't fix!


The dress is pretty but way too big. I'm usually size 4 (125 pounds, 5,3") and I order size 8 as per the chart on the left and it was way too big and long.


Nice dress, but I needed to wear it almost immediately, and it was too wrinkled even after shower steam. Would've had to be dry cleaned to wear. Plus, it was slightly too long and made me look like I had a tummy.


You can tell that it's not expensive when looking at the lining, but from any other point of view, it looks really classy. I wish it was a little longer, only because I'm 5'9", but for normal people it should be perfect.


I love the price and quality!!! I definitely recommend this dress.


The dress was nice and fit perfectly. The pins are what I had an issue with. One, I was able to put on but the other pin was hard to close. Pretty dress though. I felt like an empress.


This is wonderful fabric, but a little too voluminous at the waist and so a bit unflattering.


Not even close to the size in the product size chart
