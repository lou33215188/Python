the dress doesn't fit the description .It look like old lady night gown or a housedress. I am actually returning this one .


With the price being fairly cheap, the dress looked really nice! The color and look of the dress matched perfectly with the the displayed picture. The dress was folded nicely in the packaging and arrived 2 days after placing my order. I was definitely pleased, thank you!


I like the dress but is really different from the one in the picture the color is like a thousand shades lighter, and definitely looks amazing on the picture so it sets really high expectations.


beautiful !!!! =) too long but I FIX it!! it was awesome! <3


very pretty dress, just too small i would say order 2 sizes up from your normal size


Looked nice for New Years party.


The breast area is not lined and it would be hard to wear a bra with this dress. Color is like David's bridal coral reef.


good product


Top was bustier than I expected.


With a few alteration this could be a very beautiful dress. A bit long for my 5'2 frame and a bit tight across the empire waist.
