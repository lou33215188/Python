I ordered this for my daughter. I intentionally ordered it too big because I thought it might be smaller than expected (and she's very full busted so I wanted to have room for the girls). It's a nice dress for the price and will be easy to take up in the waist. The length is good(my daughter is 5'4" and will wear heels) but it could easily be shortened.


This product wasn't what I expected in the bust area.  The dress was too low cut and I returned it for that reason.  The other aspects of the dress were fine and portrayed well in the description, but I wasn't comfortable with the top of the dress and didn't' have time to get it altered.


Beautiful dress!  AMAZING price!


Use the size chart for the dress.  Be honest with yourself about your measurements.  I wear 4/6 jeans.  I read the chart.  Ordered size 8 dress.  Fits like a glove!  Perfect!


Purchased to wear to a Gala the size as 12 but it was a bit small. I've experienced in the past that wedding cuts are a little smaller than regular clothing. I bought a size larger and it was very snug. COuld be that I gained weight but I believe the cut of the dress was small. Wore it with spanx and had a ball at the ball. Good deal.


Wore this for my outdoor wedding in Florida. It was gorgeous and comfortable! :)


Looks better in the picture, but not for me.

I ordered a size 6 and fits perfectly!


Absolutely beautiful.  I knew from a previous purchase that it runs small, and i needed to go up one size, but I love the dress and cant wait to wear it!


fit very nicely true to size lots of compliments people didn't believe it was under 30.00


This is for a Halloween costume, so I wasn't expecting high quality.  It fits well, the color is nice and it's cut in a way that would flatter many shapes.  I'm satisfied.
