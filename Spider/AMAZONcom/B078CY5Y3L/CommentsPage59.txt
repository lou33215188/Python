I dont love the dress only because I didn't love how it fit my body ...other than that it was a beautiful dress and I will most likely wear it again if given the opportunity. Will post pictures. Long, comfortable, great style.


Super cheap material.


Wife wore this to a Harlem nights themed party she was so beautiful fit her so nice with her gloves black feather boa and accessories


At least the color was right. Wrong dress and missing buttons.


I love it with 2 weeks until my sisters 16 i was getting frustrusted with nothing to wear i currently wear a size 10 of jeans and got it 2 size up fit like a glove! i will be posting pics when i have them just that i wanted a diffrent color last minute so im going to return it back and just ordered the new one cant wait for the price its a steal!!


Did not have enough time to return. Wore it and got nice compliments but I felt it was too big.


On the brust was too big, took it to tailor for alter.


Came in the mail very quick, nice fabric, and matched the color very well.


After a year she wore that dress again and looks fantastic. Any lady will look prettier in it. Any lady will always look prettier with more flowers on.


Beautiful dress! Received many compliments!
