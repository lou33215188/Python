The only thing I really liked about the dress other than the picture, was the color. I got it in the light purple. I got a size 16 since I am a tad busty. The fit was very awkward, fitting in some places but not others. I looked and felt very square. I like the dress but will have to return it.


Perfect for the g mom of the groom for my wedding


Amazing!


The dress was too large for me to wear. I had to return it. The fabric is nice and soft. The customer service with this company is amazing!


Dress was simple and elegant; however, the description said there were detachable crystals on the shoulders and there were not. The shoulders have no decoration at all. It still works for what I need but the crystals would have made it look nicer.


this was a great dress , just didnt fir , and it was to lavish for the occasion, however i would totally recommend


Very well made and just as expected and better!


Runs very small- ordered 2 sizes bigger and it fit perfect. Its very flattering.


I ordered this dress on a crunch time limit. I had someone measure me so that I would hope to have correct size delivered. Well long story short the dress was huge, I ordered a 12 when I should have ordered a 8. Fortunately I was able to get the dry cleaners to alter dress.. The seamstress did a awesome job!!! I truly looked like a elegant diva...


The dress is super light and comfy. Its classic and beautiful.  Its a real steal for the price and quick shipping. Plus! It was the color the bride was looking for which was the hardest feat. Thanks!
