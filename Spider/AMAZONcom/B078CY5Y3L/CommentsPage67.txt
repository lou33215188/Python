It feels like a more expensive dress than it is. It fits well unaltered, but is cut very low of you're even a little busty. Overall, this was a great buy.


sagged off of me.


Great for the price and used in a wedding. Photographed well.


Not for a girl with bigger breasts.  It didn't fit at all in the bust area.  Sadly, it has to go back.


Bigger around the bust and waist than advertised on the picture chart. Absolutly no padding in the bust. Quality is decent, and the color is true to picture. I might return for a smaller size


Beautiful dress! Go a size up

I'm 5'2" and 115lbs and the 4 fit perfectly. It was not too long and didn't need to be hemmed at all.


I order this dress in black for my mom and she loves it. Was not sure of the size so I got her a size 16. The dress went all the way down to the ground. She is going to look beautiful for my wedding. Would recommend.


The vendor was quick to ship  loved the dress ran small. Was sad it did not fit
