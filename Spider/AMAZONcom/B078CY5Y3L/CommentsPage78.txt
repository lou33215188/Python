Very cheaply made dress however it will work for a one time use sort of thing, like a bridesmaid dress. It’s not awful, but it’s not great either.


Dress was way too big. Next size down was way too small. No packing or return slip with either one so now I'm stuck with 2 dresses that don't fit.


I'm 5'5 and weight 130lbs. I ordered size 6 and it fit me perfectly. The dress came a little bit wrinkled, other than that its a beautiful dress. I am happy with my purchased.


This dress is absolutely beautiful. I will have to hem it at the bottom since I am very short but that is normal for me. The part I wasn't expecting was to have to take it in at the top. I am a D cup and I followed the chart exactly. The dress hangs a little bit loose in the chest area for my taste so I will be modifying the dress to hug and support more in that area. Can't wait to wear it!


Beautiful dress, but def runs small I believe. Perfect for a bridesmaid dress! Reordered a bigger size! Great price for a wedding!


This dress fit perfectly, and I really like the style.  The front is a little low-cut for the "Mother of the Groom" so I purchased a beautiful butterfly brooch/pin to clasp where cleavage should be hidden.


Dress was much nicer than expected. I ordered it for a Halloween costume, and expected it to be much lower quality than it was. With some tailoring, it easily could have been worn to a formal event. Very good for the price.


Fits nice


Fit perfectly. Looked pricier than it was. I will be wearing as maid of honor to my sisters wedding. I got a size 4. I am 34-25-40 5’4” and 135 lbs


Bought this dress for my daughter to attend a formal wedding. It fit her perfectly.
