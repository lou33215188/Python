The color (green) of the dress is very nice and the quality is OK. It's suitable to wear to a wedding or prom. Before wearing it it I needed to make it smaller since it is not true to size.


Dress was a perfect length I'm 5'5 . I purchased it to wear at a beach. Wedding with jazzy flat sandals .  The top was surprisingly small , as so am I so that worked.  Don't see how a bustly woman would be able to wear this dress .


The color and material are great. Just a little to small :(


It fits slightly big in some areas.


EDIT: this dress is very see through. Found out on my wedding day that my bridesmaids undergarments showed. Overall I ended up dissatisfied. Also most of the bridesmaids were uncomfortable with how low cut this dress is.


I purchased this dress in white in a size 14. The bust was a little big but that was expected. The color was a little off and had a light purple hue but not too noticeable.


Great product, good quality dress.


Good quality. Just make sure to wear a bra with it!


Loved it great price.


Pretty but rather light and flimsy


It was also too low cut and tight around my chest


The color was beautiful


Didn't look as elegant when it arrived and was smaller than it should have been by the size chart.  Returned.
