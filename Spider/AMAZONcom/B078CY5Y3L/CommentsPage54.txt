Reading other reviews, I decided to order a 6, generally iâ€™m a 4... and it fitted perfectly!! Really loved it!!


I wore this dress as the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding and it was perfect. Very comfortable and looks more expensive than it is. I got lots of compliments and felt pretty and comfortable all day.


I am 5'1" the dress was very long on me. But great quality.


This dress is heavy and feels like a curtain. Fits big too, sent back


Going to need to get it hemmed, but otherwise fits great!


Really nice dress and fits exactly as it says on the size chart. Used it for a wedding, as a bridesmaid with a difficult color (light gray - not silver) and good value for money!


Im in between sizes with this dress but loved it so much that I decided to go get the straps taken in to fit my upper half. I love the floral print against the black, looks just like the image.


Amazing dress


Looks cheap


Got the green for a mefusa costume but was surprised at the quality! Gorgeous dress, fit perfect for me at 5'9. Ill hold on to it beyond and costume but will work great for weddings.
