Beautiful dress!  Had to adjust length since I am only 5'.  Wore for a summer outdoor wedding ceremony and indoor reception, it was perfect!


This was my prom dress and it was great. I looked amazing. My only disappointment was the underarm was too big. It made my boobs look funny so I had to fix that. It is an amazing dress!


Love it

Beautiful!


If you need a floor-length dress but don't want to spend any money- this dress is perfect!  It's not amazing quality, but I got invited to a black-tie wedding and don't own a floor length dress and realllllly didn't want to spend $100-200 on one.  This fit my needs perfectly!


They come in a little plastic bag. The dress is really great quality. It has beautiful pins attached and has a lovely flow and whimsical. This  color looked so good on all our bridesmaid. Blonde, dark. red headed or auburn they all wore this color beautifully. The waist line runs short. The length is perfect if you are s and 5ft 4 inches m at 5ft 6inches and large or extra large if over 5ft 8 inches. They can be altered fairly easily. We put capped sleeves on ours and modified the low back and low front with lace. The initial cost is so low that it was still affordable. Watch the return by date if you are thinking to try them out on your bridal party. Overall we were really pleased with this sweet full length dresses


Fits me perfectly i am so happy its long but really comfortable this is a size 12 on me


The dress is beautiful. Love the material. However it didn't fit as expected. I'm 5'2 and 130lb. The length was ok as I wanted to wear heels. Ordered a size 8


I got this as a bridesmaid dress. I followed the recommended measurements and it fit. I would say the color looks slightly more emerald than in the photo, which I thinks looks more Kelly green.
