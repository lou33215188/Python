very cute dress, the neckline is a little plunged, it goes approximately to where the imperial cut should be, for me is less than half an inch above the diaphragm hollow, I will have to buy one of those sticky bras since the sides are also low cut and any regular bra will show.


detail that bugged me: some threads from the seam on the shoulders and hem were loose.


detail that loved: the back looks gorgeous tho.


This dress is beautiful, the fabric is soft and silky. It 's fits perfectly according with the size charts. I say buy it now!!!


Im happy with my purchase!!


Lovely


The fabric isn't amazing but I still love it!


Awful.


Built in support is needed for this dress. The neckline was too low for a full figure female, perhaps tape could have worked. The fabric looked cheap.


This dress looks absolutely beautiful on! It also comes with gold and rhinestone clips to put at the shoulders. My daughter normally wears a 2-4, so we purchased the size 4 and it fit exactly. I would go a size larger than normal to be safe.


This dress is so beautiful! I bought it for my bridesmaids and it is such good quality.


Its perfect!


Exactly how it looks - just a bit warm due to the materials used for the inside part.


I ordered the white chiffon V neck dress and was awesome and fit as expected. I used it gor a formal event and it was perfect. Length was good for low heels and higher. Highly recommend.


Really, really, really flattering and forgiving on this mom-body :)


Sexy, sultry, classy.... (the green one anyway)


I bought this one and another one from Ever Pretty and love them both so much, but this one just fits better and has a very forgicing fabric/cut
