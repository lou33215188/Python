This dress makes me happy!, good quality in general, good price.


Very happy with this choice! I would recommended.


Gracias.


Great product for the price! Used in a Bridal party, easily modified to fit the style needed.


Beautiful dress at a great price!


The dress is really nice for the price I wasn't expecting great quality but it is the only issue is that the zipper is cheap and it broke


I love this clothing line. It's feminine, high quality and this dress is a perfect cut. It is simple elegance.


It does not fit in the arm/shoulder.  The arm holes are way too tight and the bust area is way too high.


I loved the dress, but i was not able to zip it all the way up. I was pushed for time for a wedding that weekend, so I had to go with something else.


The quality of material was cheap.


The size wasn't as expected and poor quality, but it's comfortable and the color is the same as the picture.


The dress is an amazingly beautiful dress and fit very well - very elegant.  Nice dress for the price its a steal!
