The dress is colorful but the top is a little large, it falls off the sholders


Not happy ,fits big cheap material


This is a very nice dress for the price. It fit as expected and the pink is really pretty. I really like the fact that I can wear a regular bra with it.


I really like it. It's just a tad snug in the bust.  I usually wear a size 4 and that's what I ordered but I wonder how the 6 might fit. Bought this for a wedding and got so many compliments on it. It's a very beautiful dress.


Super cute!


Very happy with my dress as it was beautiful and well made.


Snug in the upper ribs. I probably could have ordered a size up to be safe but the dress fits well enough as-is. I ordered the darker red color which isn't as dark as the photos.


el vestido es bello, igual a la fotografia, el color y detalles, bien confeccionado. solo que es un poco mas grande que lo que indica las medidas, yo pedi un talla 12 y me hubiera quedado perfecto el talla 10, me deje llevar por las medidas que aparecen ahi.


I bought this dress for my friend wedding and the dress fitted perfectly. It is exactly as shown in the picture. Would recommend for plus size ladies.


This dress is very beautiful and classy. I cant wait to wear it as a bridesmaid in a few weeks. Thanks
