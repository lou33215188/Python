Im gonna wear my new dress to a formal christmas party this weekend i love it. it fits good and looks beautifull


some parts was too small and it was not bright as i expected hope i have better luck next thime


It was a gift.


Fits saggy and it looks cheaply made. will be sending it back


It was a bit too big on the top and would have liked it to be longer, but I still loved it.


Very pretty and a great value for the price.


Loved the dress! It fit exactly how I expected it. I am very happy with this purchase. Two thumbs up !


It was too large it was not fitting perfectly that was the reason because I send it back to amazon..


looked good in the picture, but did not fit correctly. was hoping for it to be my prom dress but went with another ever pretty dress.


I like the quality of the dress but it was too small.I returned it and will order a larger size.
