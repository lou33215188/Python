This dress was AMAZING! i did have to get the straps shortened,  but i don't think it's dress error... just me lol! But that's it! Everything else was true to size, and literally what you see is what you get! This dress was so comfortable, and it definitely showed! I bought the sapphire dress because it's my birthstone.  I normally don't wear this color,  but it was STUNNING ! For the price,  you literally can't go wrong!


Love it just beautiful.  I am 5.7 and 148lbs and if fits like a glove.


I am writing this review on behalf of my wife. I surprised her recently with a vow renewal ceremony in the Dominican Republic on the beach. I ordered this for her knowing that this style of dress fits her extremely well. My wife is normally a size 4, but is also a 36C, so I ordered the 6 knowing that the chest on the 4 was a bit too small for her. Even in the 6, the chest area was just a tiny bit small (would probably fit a 36B perfectly), but the overall fit was great. My wife was able to hide the smaller cut in the chest well by bringing the back up a bit, so ultimately it was not a problem. One thing to note is that the material is not stretchy, so if you are between two sizes, definitely order up. Aside from that, the fit was amazing and I found it to accentuate my wife in all the right places. She looked absolutely beautiful!


Like the other reviews- this dress has issues.


1) It runs small. Order one size up, or two if you're in between sizes or have a bigger rib cage.


2) It's also short for a full length dress. I'm 5'8' and it almost hits the floor with bare feet - no heels with this dress for me.


3) The ruching in the front isn't tacked down, so it's a little baggy.


Overall, it adds weight on me - empires can be hard to wear.


The lavender is pretty. It's lined. I won't use the gold & crystal pins, but it's nice that they include them.


 Despite the issues, it will be pretty for attending my niece's princess party. I'll keep it, but don't know when I'll ever wear it again.


Good quality for the price, the dress is exactly like the pictures. I did not want my girls to spend a lot of money on a bridesmaid dress if they were going to wear it once. I got Lavender and it fits well, all my girls are size 2-3 and a 4 fit well, I posted 3 girls out of my 5 girls wearing it


Entirely different dress than what is pictured. If I were to rate this dress, it was not figure flattering, the built in bra was hard and rigid and looked foolish. Since others have commented that they were shipped the wrong thing, I will not be trying a second time around.


This dress is very flattering. I am 5â€™3â€�, 128 lbs and normally wear a size 4 in dresses. Based on reviews, I ordered a size 6, and it fit perfectly. I actually ordered this in two different colors. Interestingly, the black floral print was only 57â€� long, which was perfect for me with 4 inch heels. The hot pink dress was â€œ59-60â€� and way too long for me; so I am returning it.


This dress was comfortable and gorgeous. I'm a size 8 normally, and this 8 fit exactly as I'd want it to through the bust and waist. The only problem, and the reason I couldn't use it, is that I'm 5'5", and the dress wasn't long enough for me to wear with heels. It actually barely hit the tops of my feet barefoot. If they offered a longer length, this would be the perfect, inexpensive formal dress.


The dress has good quality for the price, I recommend ordering two sizes bigger the dress comes small and the size of long is perfect


The dress is well made like all Ever Pretty stuff but I had a few issues. The under skirt is a mini, and the overlaying skirts are somewhat transparent in the white version so you can see that. The other issue may be an Amazon issue but the size chart is not accurate. I have a 31" waist so I ordered L based on the chart saying it fit a 30.5-32" waist and this thing is at least three inches too big on me. Because it is way too big, it isn't the least bit flattering. If it fit me correctly, it would be very flattering but as it is it hangs off like a bag. You may want to buy two sizes and send the one back that doesn't fit. I should've. Other than that, it's a great dress for the price.
