Very happy with this dress! It's flattering, fits well and the chiffon drapes nicely! It's very low cut, so one may need a low cut bra to wear it with. I think it's an amazing dress for the price.


For the price, the dress will work perfectly for an event where I'll be using it as a costume.  If you want a nice dress that is a great price, definitely recommend.  It fits perfectly too.


This dress was amazing!  I felt like a princess.  I did not use the crystal pins that came with the dress as I thought they were a little 80s for me.


Fantastic dress! Arrived on time as pictured, just what I was looking for! I felt gorgeous in it!!


very beautiful and it looks perfect


Flows with the slightest breeze, good fit all around, I am 5'8" and with 3" heels, this was the perfect length. I did stick up the plunging neckline about 2 inches so that my bra would not show, but many complements on it throughout the night.


Received and will update after wearing but looks suitable for the outing I need it for.


Very good dress for the money, very pretty. All the girls loves this, I bought multiple for the party. I would definitely recommend this dress.


The dress is pretty just like the picture my only complaint is that i ordered the coral but it instead looks more like a dark pink color and i now have change my wedding colors again also there are no rhinestones attached to the sleeves its just plain..


This dress showed up on time and was better than I expected. Ordered it for a bridesmaid dress and was pleasantly surprised - it fit well, was a lovely color, and you can't beat the price!
