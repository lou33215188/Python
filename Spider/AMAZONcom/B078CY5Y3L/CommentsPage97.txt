Perfect!


I would love this if it was larger.  With a low vee on my dress, it doesn't cover enough for the ceremony.


To long , need to have it hem.


It's pretty. It will need some alterations.


We will be returning this one. It fits someone at least three sizes bigger than a sz 16.


I am 5 ft tall and usually wears a size 2 - 4. I bought the size 4 in hot pink. The dress is too long and the top straps are too long for my size. I wish I could fit in it. Despite the cheap materials, the dress is very cute and pretty. The low cut shows off the girls well without being vulgar. The dress also covers the side boob areas well. The zipper is difficult to zip enough when I am not wearing it. At last, I have to return it (with sadness bc I really like this dress) because of the poor fitting and the problem with the zipper. This dress should look amazing on someone with an average height.


The top is too revealing for me unless I join the edges and sew it up at least a couple of inches.


Very pretty, great price


Itâ€™s pretty. But way too big


Just as pictured.
