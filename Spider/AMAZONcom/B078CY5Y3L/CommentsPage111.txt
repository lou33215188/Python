this dress fit perfectly, its soft and very feminine and the price is the icing on the cake. Would recommend it to anyone wanting a night out on the town dress. Simply beautiful and elegant.


I am satisfied with the delivery, it was on time.


The dress is what everyone is sating, very nice.  The bustier is a little tight when zipping up, but I have a wide back due to sports.  Overall, I liked it.


Love it. It fits almost perfectly


The dress has a VERY low cut V.


The dress, although pretty, did not fit as described.


I love this dress so much!


Great dress for the price


Nice fabric and arrived really quick.  Will buy more from the site.


I ordered this dress last-minute for a formal function and loved it the second I took it out of the package. The color was true to the picture (always a plus) and the material was light and airy. A great dress if you're one of those woman who is constantly fidgeting and pulling at dresses that are too fitted or revealing. I was between sizes and ordered the larger size. Just a tad too big, but nothing a seamstress can't fix. The dress was pretty long, but then again, I'm kind of short (5'3") - if I'd had more time I would have had it hemmed.


Note: the crystal details on the shoulders are actually pins that you put on yourself. Really pretty, but the edges are kind of pointy and dug into my neck and shoulders a bit. There is probably a way to fix this or reposition them so it doesn't happen, I just didn't try very hard.


Perfect for my engagement photos! I couldn't decide between a 6 or and 8 so I ordered both sizes and the 6 fit perfectly!
