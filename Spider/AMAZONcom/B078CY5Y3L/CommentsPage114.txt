Beautiful dress but it is cut very low under the arms and low in the back so no bra!


It fits well and is as beautiful as the pictures! Would order again.


Loved it!


it was a little big on me but i had it tailored and looked amazing


Wore this to a wedding! Perfect!


I love this dress, fits very good,and looks beautiful and sexy, love it


Excellent customer service handling these issues. The dress didn't meet the body cut my fiance needed and we regrettably had to return the item. It was gorgeous though, and she admittedly has had difficulty finding a better dress. Something just weren't meant to be!


Cheap and great!


...Then again, she looks hot in anything. The dress came ontime and in good condition. The price was a bargain also. I was slightly too big but it was still a great looking dress.


Great dress for the price
