This dress runs way to small


love the colors


I measured and went according to the size chart but the dress was too big under the arm and breast


good


My wife love it.


the dress looks much smarter in the pic, it does not fit very well and the color is very different


Bust area and straps are not make well, way to big.  I will return.  Nice material but the top is very funkie.


awesome !


perfect for my last minute event. It looked more elegant then a lot of the other dresses at the party.


I ordered this for my sister as a bridesmaid dress, but it was a bit too small. We ordered the "pink", hoping that it would be a little pinker than in the picture, but it's actually almost tan! We sent it back.
