The dress arrived much earlier than expected, so I am satisfied with the seller's delivery service.


Concerning the dress itself. Overall, it's not a bad purchase, yet


1) It came without the removable diamantes decorating the shoulder,


2) The cut under armpits is big, which is not comfortable,


3) Without a bra the front cut doesn't look very supportive.


I am returning it since with the same price it may be possible to find a better dress and the seller kindly offers a full refund option.


It is great for the price you pay. Totally wearable. Would definitely buy from seller again.


Very pretty, fits perfectly, nice fabric


I followed the measurement instructions and the dress fit my sister perfectly! She will be wearing it as a brides maids dress in May. It arrived on time and is excellent condition. I would highly recommend this product and seller :)


This fits exactly the way it should based on the measurements section, which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, the white color is TOO sheer. There is no way to wear this without something like a full-length slip under it--even nude underwear shows through.


Great quality


I likened that it looked very good and fit perfect and came fast. I didnâ€™t like that the zipper gets stuck but does go up after a few tries. Other then then I I loved it.


Waist fit perfectly but bust was wayyyy too big and it's very long. I love how it looks though and I will be taking it to be altered.


This  dress is very pretty,  exact  color I  needed. However,  its very  plain, but with your accessories,  it will be beautiful.  Fit was exact to size, not too long, without  heels it barely touched the floor, with 3 inch heels perfect length,  im 5 '6.


the chest area was smaller than i expected.


I should have bought a size bigger


also the dress was quite long


I am 5'1134lbs34D i bought size 6
