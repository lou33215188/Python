I love it


Just perfect!!!  I love them deep purple color.  My girls are going to look gorgeous in these dresses!


You can't beat the price. I didn't think it was going to be this nice. I was concerned about the sizeso ordered a size up , I actually could of gone with my correct size. But still will work fine. And the pink is very pretty.


Way to small in the bust for the rest of the dress. No way to alter to make it fit properly. The material looks nice, You'll feel like a princess.


Gorgeous dress, my sister wore this for my wedding it was beautiful, cleavage a bit low but we fixed that to make it slightly modest,


Fit ok except for the length. ...I would have to be six feet tall and wear heels to be able to walk in it.


I bought this dress for a wedding . I absolutely loved it .. It fit perfectly.. And i got a ton of compliments :)


Unfortunately this item did not fit my fault totally, the ordering and return process were absolutely fantastic, shipping came quickly item was beautiful it just did not fit to my disappointment, recommend for the price and item and especially for the ease of ordering


I purchase a size 14 and it fit perfect only a little big in the bust. The color was the same as the picture. Love it


Received fast and in good condition, the style and design is nice. It ift a little too big but I was exepecting it that way so I could fix if necessary.
