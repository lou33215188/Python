I'm five to the dress was too long


Loved it but it was too long and I did not have time to alter it.


love


Please use the chart! You won't be sorry! I'm 5'2 and when I wear heels, the length is perfect! It arrived in only 3 days! The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 star rating is the packaging. It came in a small, plastic bag and was very wrinkled! Nothing a quick steaming won't fix. Well worth the price!


the front of the dress needs a shell or bra pads very sheer. This was disappointing. other than that it was a nice dress.


It's a bit tight in the bust line however I did just have a baby.  Other than that I love the dress!


I had to ham it because I'm short but it does fit as expected otherwise. For the price this dress is excellent. I needed in a hurry for a last minute event and it was gorgeous.


Is a nice dress. I get the black floral... But the colors looks more vivid in photos that in person


The fitting was very weird. Even the smallest size was too big for me.


Material looked kinda of cheep was a lil disappointed..
