Perfect fit. Made a little weird though. You get what you pay for, not the best material but worth it for the price. Would definitely recommend this dress!


It fits as expected, but it is very long, I think they should've them shorter.


Smell really bad and color is not the same like a picture ğŸ˜”


Love this dress, perfect fit.I bought this dress to wear in Las Vegas for a nice night out,and the price was great.


a little loose


Definitely exceeded my expectations! Beautiful dress


This dress fit to a T. The fabric makes it so that you could wear it more cashually, but I must say I felt like I met the requirements for a formal wedding. I got so many compliments. The jewels on the shoulders were perfect, but are the reason I gave 4 stars. If I'd seen a close up of the jewels, I might've been more hesitant to purchase this dress because they weren't my style. However, I didn't think twice about it after they were pinned on. Also, I would've give 5 stars except in the bust area, I couldn't get the dress to stay put while dancing. This made my adhesive bra visible. For a nondancing crowd and someone with better posture than me, this probably wouldn't be an issue. :)


I bought this for my friend's wedding. It is a bit big in the chest area and very low cut but over all it is a nice dress. The fabric is lovely quality. There is a deep V cut in the back as well that I wasn't aware of.


This is really very good value but I needed something a little more formal so the style and lightness of the fabric were not quite right. Would make a perfect prom dress.


My daughter is a high school freshman and at the last minute I decided to allow her to go to the military ball.  With the ball nine days away and a limited budget we needed something that would look great, but also not require any alterations.  My daughter is 5'3", 125 lbs, has a 30" waist and a B cup.  We purchased this dress in light purple.


Length:  First I was afraid a full length gown might need to be taken up at the hem.  We were able to purchase shoes with heels high enough to allow the dress to fall perfectly at her toes.


Bust:  Second I was afraid that she would not fill in the top area.  We went to Walmart and purchased strapless adhesive bra petals for the bust area.  IT TURNED OUT PERFECTLY.  She didn't necessarily fill the top area but she did not have to!  It actually looked really elegant the way the material hung loosely around her bust.


Wrinkles:  The dress arrived in small packaging.  The only mishap we had is there were wrinkles from the packaging.  We started trying to steam the middle section which was a total mistake.  It fell flat, started to sag and looked horrible.  We had to gently wet it and lay it flat with a book on top to get the crinkle shape back.  This totally fixed it. The only section of the dress I would recommend steaming is the bust area.


***After I bought the dress my daughter felt pressure from all of her friends to wear something that was only knee length.  I assured her she would make a splash with elegance if she stuck with this.  Sure enough, she did!!!  She said all eyes were on her and received so many compliments.


This dress is a winner.
