Wrong product


This dress arrived fast, fit well, and was perfect for the wedding I attended!


I like the dress however the cut around the arms does not fit me well.


The color of the dress doesn't coincide with the delivered. The delivered one is a much darker pink


Satisfied with shipping. I ordered up to be on the safe side and the dress feels loose so I plan to take it for alterations. Price is def good. Dress is very light which is great but very wrinkly.


Dress is beautiful but size up two sizes. Made very small.


Nice dress!!! Wonderful color, I had a lots of great comments... I got the medium size, fits great in me but if you have a big chest might be a little bit tide for u!!!


Beautiful like the photo. I'm petite so I had to adjust the bustline. Perfect with a two inch heel!!


it is really small and the material almost feels stiff and cheap


beautiful and comfortable dress.


nice fabric really light


received lotttt of comliments
