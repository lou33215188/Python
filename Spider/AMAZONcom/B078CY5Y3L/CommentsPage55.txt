Beautiful dress, but it exposed a lot in the front...more so than it did in the photo.  And the waist areas was too tight for me.  For these 2 reasons I had to return the dress.


Beautiful my daughter went to prom with it


Great bridesmaids dress!  Perfect fit for very different sized and shape women, very flattering and really good quality for the price.  Would recommend!


The quality is great, but I will be returning this dress.  The color isn't a true navy--it's more of a blue.  The top was too baggy on me.


Pretty dress


Was kind of wrinkly but we steamed it out and it worked out just fine. It did arrive balled up in a tiny bag.


The dress fit perfect in size, but the bottom of the dress was unfinished and was ripped in places. I got it for a short-notice wedding and I have to wear it; I will have to pay extra for altering now.


Very pretty


Very small around the rib cage area, sized up and still wouldn't zip, very pretty dress though!


It did zip up but the cut is so low in the front I couldn't wear it in public, especially for a Christmas concert. Just not for me
