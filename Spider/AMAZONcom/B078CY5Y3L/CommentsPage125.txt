I like the dress but it's too small. I am 5'2 and 115 pounds.  I usuallu use size 4 but not for this brand.


I ordered it for my teenage girl,  it fits right and the material id of quality.


Good dress.


I got the product a few nights before my wedding day, and I had to fix it myself with needle and thread. I followed the size guide and it wass till waaay too big.


Perfect.


The dress fit as expected, however, I don't like the quality of the material. I don't think it has the bridesmaid effect I had anticipated. not sure if I will wear for this occasion, a wedding but will wear it to some other function in the future.


My girlfriend ordered this dress and it felt much larger and more bulky than the size chart depicted. The fabric and color of the dress were nice enough but they size made it unwearable


This dress is elegant and comfortable. The color is beautiful and the length perfect with heels. The only thing is that it comes a bit on the bigger size, so I would recommend to look at the sizing chart carefully, I had to make alterations so it would fit right. Other than that, it is a perfect wedding dress day or night!


dress was nice color was off it more of a peach than a pink and the dress ran big in size accourding to the chart


I gave the item 3 stars only because the dress looked previously worn. The material had several snags. Very pretty dress on though. The item was a little bit too large for me. The 4 was too small. Did not have time to send back for another dress.
