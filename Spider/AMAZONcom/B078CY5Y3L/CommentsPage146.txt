I always order from everpretty for my bridesmaid dresses. This was not the exception. However this time, the dress goes by far too short. I'm 158 cm/ 5"2'. I will have to wear flats or something not to high.  Quality is as other everpretty dresses. It's not the best, but I have seen worst dresses. I really like their quality.


Terrible packaging. I should not have to pay to unwrinkle.


unfortunately the dress was way too big. i would have liked it except for that fact.


Cute and great quality!


Length wise a bit too short. These dresses should be longer in order to look more formal


Ordered a size 4 and a size 6 for my sister who was a bridesmaid in my wedding.  The size 6 fit fine.


I was  surprised to see how nice it fit, very beautiful dress. I recommended to all of my friends.I love it.


It is exactly as advertised, lovely material and fits perfectly. i can't wait to wear it!


I did not get the rhinestone part of the dress that was supposed to attach to the shoulder. Can you send this to me.


Beautiful
