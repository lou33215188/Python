Fast shipping! This dress is so much prettier in person. Well made and color is just as expected.


too small and too long but a nice dress


I tried and tried to find a bra that would work, but they all showed.


A little snug but will work. Love the silloute


Beautiful item , exactly as shown in picture . Delivered on time


Super cute, fits well. But you'll need to get it to a tailor of some sort because it needs more lining on the bottom half of the dress! Talk about see through...


This is really pretty!


I could not zip this dress up.  Zipper didn't work smoothly, and bodice was too tight.  So even though the dress is pretty, I had to return it.


Dresses were nice but the fit were somewhat small. Not true to size and also length was short. But great price!


It came with a broken zipper that I had to have replaced.  Overall..pretty dress for the price.
