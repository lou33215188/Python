Stunning dress at an amazing price.  Had to slightly tack / alter the dip at the "V" neckline because a bit too revealing, but no big deal for the price.  STUNNING!


You absolutely cannot beat this dress at this price. It is a nice classic style, it fit well, and the fabric felt nice. There were a couple stray threads but nothing alarming.


Beautiful! My mom wore the blue and bridesmaids wore the coral. It was incredibly flattering on both talk and slender as well as shorter and "rounder" people and everyone's upper halves looked great! :)


Love this dress a whole lot will take to alter, worth the extra. Beautiful and reasonable.


Received this dress today!! Fit perfectly!! I ordered an 8 which is my normal size!! Very nice dress for the price!! Fast delivery too!! I ordered the hot pink very pretty color!!


It is absolutely gorgeous, and I can't wait to wear it in a wedding this summer. I can't believe I found such a high quality dress for this price!


I wish this dress had worked for me, because it was so pretty! It really isn't made for anyone with a small chest, and there is no smaller option.


The size chart was off by a lot.  I wear a US size 12 but decided to go with a 14 just to be safe.  The decorative rutching around the waist droops down beyond my navel.  I look like a little girl playing dress-up


needed it for a wedding wasn't able to wear it since it was to small. I would have gone up a size. I give it 3 stars because it was really pretty and looked great but didn't zip


Bought this for my cousins wedding fro my bridesmaid dress. It fit perfectly and was gorgeous!
