A very cute dress! It would be a little long without heels. I am 5'7" and I wore 2 1/2" heels.


I love the dress, its gorgeous, looks just like the picture. The only thing I didn't like is that the top is a little too big, I usually wear a 12/14 and the sleeves fall off a little & I have to pin the boop area because its loose and I have a large chest so this doesn't happen to me often


The top of the dress, from the shoulder to waistline is very short.  I am a D cup and barely got in it.  The dress is beautiful and fabric has a nice flow.  It is a simple dress that can be easily accessorized up but is a little too low cut to be appropriate for a formal event, for my taste.  It will be a great for a smoking hot dress for a nice date night.  Wasn't a complete disappointment,  just wasn't formal enough for the event I was attending.


I absolutely loved the dress. I purchased it for a wedding shower party. It arrived promptly an the the fit was perfect. Neck line an underarm area was very low,I simply wore a black Cami an it looked fine.  After reading the reviews regarding size , I ordered my current size, it  was perfect. I definitely received complements. Great buy.


Fit as expected. My busty self was just too big for the top. Not the makers fault. Iâ€™m 40DDD and ordered a 14. Loved it just wish my boobs fit.


arrived on time and fits perfect;y. the perfect dress for a summertime affair.


I love this dress. Big hit at the wedding I attended and can't wait to wear again


Very pretty color.  I bought this dress in white for my wedding and was so


happy with it I decided to get this in blue for an upcoming ball.


Can't wait to wear it!


Had to get it hemmed; VERY long, but I'm also short (5'2")


Great Quality, it was just too small. I will have to return
