I love the pattern and fit of this. It is fitted but has stretch. Very form fitting, which I was expecting and like. Also the material is a bit thicker = quality!! Over all bought 2 other and love them as well!!!


Good quality for the price.


Very pretty just wish I went up a size.


Love it! I get compliments everytime I wear it. Flattering. Beautiful colors. True to size.


This specific style did not fit me. It was huge in the waist. I am 5'4", 100 lbs, with a D cup. Though it fit in the chest okay, it was large in the arms. It could have been a bit smaller on the hips..... But the waist was extremely large. ğŸ˜“


Very Pretty.  Buy a size up.


cute dress but it was too small for me, I was 10lbs to much


Beautiful dress, bur a medium is equal to a size 3 which is absurd!


Super cute, but runs small.


Love this dress! True to size and at such an affordable price. Can't wait to buy more.
