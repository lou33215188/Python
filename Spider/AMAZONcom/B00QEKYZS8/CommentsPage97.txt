Its a decent material but the sizing is off. The color was also not what is pictured.


It shows my curves love it I'll be ordering another 1


I absolutely love this dress. Good material, nice stretch. Looks great on me. I'll be ordering more. I did have to order one size up.


I do like this dress but I don't love it. It is very tight and I wish it was a tad more forgiving. I've worn it several times and received complements each time. Great price!


This dress is very pretty, super comfy and fits great!  I am usually a 4 or 6 in jeans, but very busty so I ordered the Large and it was perfect.  The fabric is nice and thick, can't see through it at all.


runs small, will show a belly if you have one. This doesn't camouflage anything.


It is a good material,nice print but the sizing can be a little challenging as I bought a small size,I guess a medium could work better.


maybe I should have order a large because this dress run a lil big to me. I like the length past my knees, but under arm and waist its saggy (big) I waist it and put in dryer and hope it will shrink but that didn't work either oh well I like the colors and style


Great dress!


Got so many compliments wearing this dress. Felt great on, the material is so soft it is like wearing a sexy t-shirt!
