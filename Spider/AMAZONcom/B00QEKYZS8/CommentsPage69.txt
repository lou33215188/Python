I’m 5’6 and 138lbs and bought a medium. Fit perfectly!


Amazing! Think of your favorite t-shirt, just longer - very sexy and curve hugging. And the beautiful flower print is very "in" right now. I bought the peachy-pink color and I felt very feminine wearing it. I also paired it with beige peep-toe heels and a blouse-y open top to give some needed coverage in the back for work. It's that sexy! Love all the different colors. I got the navy one too.


Love the style, it's just they say a size and it's not accurate.


Very cute summer dress.. Toms Ware dresses are very nice. fits very well


Fits like a glove. 5'1" 117# got the small.  Love the material and not see through at all. Great deal.


toms ware never lets me down. not as thick as the last one but fits well. will just wear in different weather


The dress, as made, priced and sold, is fabulous.  It doesn't look inexpensive (the material is more than expected for the price as noted by other purchasers) and when you put it on, you look like a model!  Paired with the right hair, make-up, and accessories, you will look like you stepped off of a runway in this dress.  Based on the reviews, and now my own experience, I've purchased other dresses from Tom's Ware.  Dress came timely and in good packaging so that you could tell it was new.  #satisfiedcustomer  :-)


Love their dresses for casual and business casual attire. Great, flexible and soft material.


I like the print is exactly like the picture. It’s barely long enough for my 5’8” frame though. It comes to just above my knee not to my knee.


The fit was nice but it was unhymned so the bottom just rolls up but the fit is lovely
