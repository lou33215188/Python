I'm only giving this 3 stars because the color was way off. I ordered pink and when the dress got here it was coral. However, the dress fits awesome, tge fabric is thick, and I'm 5'8 and it comes to my knees. I'm honestly just really disappointed in the color bc I got things to match it and now I can't wear them. I'm including a picture of a picture of the dress online and what I received with a light pink tank top next to it so you can see the color difference.


Orginally ordered I'm a large and was too big! Ordered in a Medium and it fit perfectly. I am 5'5, measurements 36-30-40, 145lbs. Great material and pretty color.


CURVES, CURVES, & MORE CURVES FOR DAYS!! yesss!! This dress flatters a curvaceous figure!!!


Love the dress was just a tad bit big but I love the quality and the design of the dress!


Material was nice. think and strechy and cotton feeling.  But size was too large ordered 2XXL so return for L/XL normally I am a size 10/12.


This dress is perfect. I'm 190 lbs and 5'4", I ordered an xl and it's perfect on me. Fits right below the knee


Great price! Great fit! It doesnâ€™t even wrinkle!!


The boyfriend of the girl I sent it to really likes it on her.


Fits well and looks and feels good. Would recommend this, but 100% polyester is not cool enough on hot days.


I ordered a large and recieved an xl. I kept it bc i didn't want it super tight. It's is so comfy and I can dress it up or down. Ordered more.
