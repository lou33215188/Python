it was ok. i thought it would have actually been the xl i bought. was too short the fact that i'm 5'10" its hard to find longer dresses


This dress looks the same as in the picture.  The material is really nice and fits comfortable.  I will recommend the dress to anyone.


Summer black dressğŸ˜�


Cute overall, but I am a 36DD and the bust area was very, very tight in a large.  I sent it back.  Cute colors and overall good quality.


I love this dress and my man REALLY  loves this dress!


Cute dress , but it was way too small... I sent it back!


Way smaller than the size ans the material is ugly.


My favorite day to day dress, so comfortable and fits perfect.  I have them in several colors and patterns.


Absolutely beautiful dress, the length is modest but the fit is sexy. I love to wear it to special occasions, would definitely buy it again!
