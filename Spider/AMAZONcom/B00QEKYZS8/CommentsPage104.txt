Love the dress perfect for work, with a bit of accessories great for dinner & drinks wit friends


Perfect dress! It's thick enough that it's not see-through, and is super flattering. I am 5'6", 135 lbs, I got a size small/medium and it fits great. Goes just to my knees.


The material was thick and nice, but it fit incredibly small. I normally wear a Large, but after reading the reviews I ordered a 2XL. Even going 2 sizes up this dress does not fit and I will be returning ASAP! I'm really disappointed because the colors and fabric are amazing.


Just awful! I actually felt worse about myself after trying this on.


I love this dress! It fits perfectly! Its really pretty and fits like a glove.


Love it so much, will order again...


Love it. Very flattering but still modest coverage. Perfect for Easter.


Bought 2 sizes up a little big but I love


Very pretty and nicer than expected.


I am in LOOOOOOOOVE with this dress! It is constructed beautifully, not flimsy at all. I like that dress isn't see through at all. It super comfy and SO flattering! I have gotten compliments all day! Love it!
