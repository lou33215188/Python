Can You Say Hourglass ? :) I Love This Dress , I Can't Wait To Wear This Dress On My Trip In A Week And A Half <3


Love the dress for the price!!


I purchased a xs/s pink floral and am returning it. For reference, I am 5'2" 107 lb. 32DDD. I was swimming in the dress, except around the buttocks, which is odd because I don't even have a big bottom. By contrast, I am full-chested, and yet, there was still lots of loose material around that area. The worst are the sleeves, which are very wide. So disappointed, as it looked very pretty on some of the other buyers who have posted pictures. Oh, and the dress is not as thick as others have claimed. I was wearing a string and could see the lines through the dress. And lastly, the dress is not made for somebody of my stature. I get that it is a midi and not a mini, but the dress went past mid-calves on me. So sad.
