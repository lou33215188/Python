I love this dress! Got a 2x fits sooo good.


I really like this dress. It's casual and elegant. Great fit.


Beautiful dress! Very good quality!


Too smal (although a "large" one, according to the label)  and tight - rides up while walking.


Was more like a Medium. Did not like the fit.


The dress fits perfect it's one of my favorites right now. The quality is wonder.


Love it!!


My wife loved it.  It is also slimming.


All the comfort of wearing a t-shirt. Very comfortable.


Very cute,  yet classy! Love the fit!
