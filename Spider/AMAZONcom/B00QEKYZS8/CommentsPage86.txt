DRESS FITS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED I GOT AN SIZE BIGGER JUST IN CASE IT WAS A LITTLE SMALL BECAUSE I AM A VERY CURVY WOMAN BUT OTHER THAN THAT ITS PERFECT!


The fit is a little snug, but still love the dress.  I would buy again


Such a great dress, perfect fit and super comfortable material! I would have loved it even more if the sleeves were either a tank top cut or maybe a 3/4 sleeve instead of the t-shirt cut. Beautiful colors and I got so many compliments!


Love the material


Stretchy


Sexy, slimming, fitted dress.  I am size 14/16, busty, and the L/XL was snug in all the right places if you like rocking those curves.  Looks even better with shapewear.  Wore to a wedding and felt very confident. Also purchased in navy.


Feels good and looks great!


Sizes not correct.


I love everything about this dress, the color the fabric and the length. It is my new favorite summer dress.


Thick material! I would order again.
