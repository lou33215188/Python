So gorgeous. Fits so nicely and is incredibly pretty. I bought this in pink, turquoise and navy


Adorable and comfortable dress!


This dress is beautiful and exactly as pictured.  It fits true to size - very snug as it is supposed to be.  I love it!


I absolutely love this dress. I bought it for my baby shower and it will be perfect. The material isn't thin but it's still breathable. I'm 7 1/2 months pregnant, a size l-xl before I got pregnant, I ordered an xl and it fit perfectly.


I'm 5'7", 145lbs and the small/medium fits as expected. It definitely hugs all the curves but doesn't feel too tight. The style looks great. I got it in the black, but I thought the flowers in the pattern would be redder -- they have more of an orange tint to them. I'm returning but only because I decided the pattern doesn't suit me. I wish there were more options in the solid colors!


Very nice thick material. I was looking for a dress that resembled a lularoe Julia without paying the price. This dress did the trick! Super comfy too. I'm 5'5 and 140lbs and the medium fit perfectly.


Very good ! Love it


I love the dress but it is too big, and regretfully I am very late in returning. It has not been worn, tags are still intact. May please return it still for store credit?


This dress is very comfortable and stretchy but I felt ridiculous the moment I put it on. It is skin tight and shows every single curve and/or fat roll. Looked like something a prostitute would wear.


super cute. comfortable material and shows off the curves. LOVE IT!
