I wear between a 2/4/6 in US dress size depending on the brand and this got perfect and cling just right. I'm 5'7" and 138lbs. I wear a 34DD. Hope this helps!


Perfect dress!  Material is not cheap! I'm 5'1,  148 lbs 36DD bra and a large fit perfect.


5'8 normally 145lbs but currently 8months pregnant medium still fit great. Will be able to wear after pregnancy also!


I got a lot of "WOW, you look great!" comments when I wore this for the first time to an office cocktail party.


Love this dress fits well and sexy with out showing too much.


I absolutely love the way this dress fits, and feels. It is so comfortable.


Very cute dress can be worned Casual or for work It fits well I'm 5"1 157lbs and ordered the medium/large just right not to tight not to lose this is probably the best dress ever ordered from Amazon


This dress fits perfectly. I'm 5'4, 157 pounds, small waist with a JLO backside. I ordered an L/XL and it isn't too tight at all. The fabric is light and airy - perfect for the summer and the colors are very vivid. Can't wait for my hubby to see me in it.


I was happy that the fabric was a thicker material. For the price I did expect maybe something less however pleasantly surprised by the quality. Fit was great.


Love it.  Nice.
