Good


This dress is one of my favorites.  It fits real good. I love the simplicity and the elegant design.  You can add accessories and make it your own. I was scare when I ordered.  My body shape is curvy and I usually have problems on the top. I'm 34 D but it fit perfectly.  I love it.


Waaaay too large. Wish I could have had it in a small not medium. I am 5'2" , 134-138lbs. Curvy.


Would be a full 5 stars if it fit a bit better. I weigh about 150 lbs, stand about 5 feet 5 inches tall and I got a small/medium size dress. It was a bit big in the stomach area. But nothing a few runs through the dryer can't help.


Cute bathing suit. However, If you are larger chested, look else where. I'm a 34DD, and because of the suits hard padding and lack of support, it's uncomfortable. I feel like a can of exploded biscuits up top. The bottoms fit well, and are comfortable. Essentially, if you are a big titty committee member, move on.


Very sad, ordered because it says rayon, turns out it's 100% polyester! I don't understand why they would lie on here... Can't wear polyester because of my kids allergies. Threw it away. Both of them....


I have bought a few dresses from this designer because I love the material, the fit, and the patterns/colors.


Bad quality and size is not corect. Very disapointed.


Dress fits great. Good quality. Material of dress feels nice. I received many compliments and plan on wearing this dress for Easter.


Love this dress!! It was so comfortable and I received so many compliments! I plan on buying more in other colors!
