I like it


Fabulously Form Fitting, Fun and Flirty!  It's one of those unexpected pieces that make you walk with confidence. Really nice.


Super cute just fit smaller than I hoped.


I love the fit. Perfect for hourglass figures.


It fits great, but it's to long, and the sleeves fit big too


Love the quality of the dress but I somehow always underestimate my size.  Need a medium. Will be exchanging soon.


Very nice dress.  Purchased it for a cruise and it fits really nice.


Great fit and hugs my curves... Im 5'8" and 160lbs - I purchased a large


Tom's Ware Womens Slim Fit Floral Sweetheart Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Midi


I'm 4'11 and only 135 lbs. I'm very curvy, so I got it in a (large/x-large) size so it wouldn't be to tight like most body con dresses are. Well, it was way to big for me, I tried shrinking it with the washer/dryer method a few times much to no avail. I will be keeping it, but bringing it to seamstress, the quality of the fabric is so good, and I know once taken in, it will fit just nicely around my curves. I'm happy with this purchase, just not with the size I chose.


Fits good
