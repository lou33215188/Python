I'm 5'1 120lbs, I ordered a s/m and although the bottom half fit nice, the top half looked like a loose tshirt. I ordered this size since I usually wear a small but I will return it and try an xs instead. Hopefully that fits better.


Great fit. Thicker but not to thick fabric. Would buy again


Love it. I fall in love with this dress every time I put it on. I wish this dress came in more patterns than just floral! The length, colors and fit are perfect one of the best dresses I've purchased.


Cute dress.


Best dress ever! Really brings out your curves! Would recommend this to anyone especially curvy ladies. It's just amazing!


Lovely dress, material and all. Fits perfect stretchy and the color looks spectacular! Lots of compliments!


Beautiful floral design. It's not cheap fabric that you see thru. Very flattering.


I love this dress already. When I first took it out of the packaging I was disappointed because it looked too big, but then I tried it on and it fit perfectly. I'm 5'3 and it stops right below my knee. The fabric feel almost like a thin terry cloth. I don't remember what I paid, but I know it was inexpensive, and I think it's worth it.


This dress is most definitely for a woman who wants to exude confidence. I love this dress. The knit is soft and comfortable. It fits smaller than I expected. I love the way it fits though. I feel confident in it. The colors are just like they are on the website. Love it~


This dress hugs your body in all the right ways.  Flaws are hidden and curves look great in it! I'm short and fluffy and it makes me feel confident.
