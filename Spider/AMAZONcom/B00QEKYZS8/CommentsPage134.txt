I bought this for my pregnant daughter and she looked adorable!  Love it !


small in size and print seems too obvious like printed on the fabric.


Color is a teal green, picture online appears sky blue. Love the fabric. Got a different color and size. Received lots of compliments.


Nice dress, good material, hugs all the right spots


The dress I received was nice quality, however it was not the correct item.


Fit like a glove. Perfect length.


Ordered a small and received a medium. I'm hoping that it will shrink when washed. Other than that, the material is great!


Did not like the fit or look on me!!


This dress is gorgeous and perfect to dress up or down! I will be ordering more in the different colors!


This is a very cute dress. Soft fabric and vivid colors, and not sheer at all. I'm 5'1" and 100lbs, bought size X-Small for reference.
