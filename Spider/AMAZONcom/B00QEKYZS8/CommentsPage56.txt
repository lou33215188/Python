The dress had a very pretty print. The fabric was not thin as you might think. The fabric and the dress design provides that middle area support and is very forgiving to your body. The dress is well made too. I do recommend sizing up if you don't like the extra snugness.


I so LOVE this dress. The flowers are vibrant the fit is awesome the length is awesome. I am so happy with this purchase.


Haven't worn it yet, but the fit is perfect, love the over the knee fit. Very pretty


This is a cute summer dress.  It fit, but a little too long, and I took in the waist with gathers which made it slimming and sexier.


I freakin love this dress! It feels like thick tshirt material.  I'm 5'10" and 165 and got the large/X large and it hits right above the knees. Perfect, comfortable church dress


This dress is super soft and amazingly comfortable. It is fitted nicely without being too snug. I'm 5'9 180 lbs and it hugs the curves nicely without being tight. I love this dress and plan on wearing it often.


Very fitted but has alot of stretch.I'm a 14/16 and ordered an xxl


It's perfect! I'm 5'9", 32 D 125 lbs. I ordered the Medium. It's form fitting without looking overly sexy. The sleeves are long (not cap sleeves). It looks really nice.


My favorite dress! I am 5'3, 105lbs with an A cup and the size small fits me like a glove. The material is very soft, comfortable and durable . The colors are super vibrant and it doesn't fade. This dress is a total steal for the price.


The dress is very cute and the fabric is thick. It is a great deal. I bought a medium  based on all the reviews. I am 5 feet4 and 135 lbs. The dress was bigger than I need it to be. I would be perfectly fine in a small. I am too lazy to return it so medium it is for me. It is to my knees so it is not too long. I got the dress faster than expected so I will probably buy from them again
