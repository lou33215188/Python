It looks so amazing , loved it


Nice fit! Came early and came with a nice bag to go with it...very cute and would shop again


Very nice I love it


The material is nicer than what I expected... Very good quality dress. Colors are vibrant and not cheap looking at all.


Very pleased with this dress.


Very disappointed in my purchase I ordered a small/medium and the tag says Medium. Fits me too large and the dress is super long, not what I wanted.


Loved it! Such a cute fit


Everything was GREAT! I ordered the dress a size too big, but it's fine I will take it in a little. thx


It's BEAUTIFUL! I love it. It's so soft and fits perfectly. I got the xs/s and I'm 5'5 115 pounds. I even threw on a jean jacket with this and you can wear this anywhere!


I love the dress but one size up (if it had been available) would be more comfortable.


Nice
