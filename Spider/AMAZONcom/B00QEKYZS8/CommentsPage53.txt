If it weren't too small, I would love it.  I'm 5'4" - 150 pounds and ordered a large.  The material hugs every spot.  (Not what I was hoping for.)  :)  Love the color and the fabric.  Will probably try an XL.


I should have read the reviews before purchasing this dress. Other than being uncomfortably tight (I'm 5'2" and 125 lbs.), it's a beautiful color and seems well made. Exchanging this for size small/medium.


Update: I got my size small/medium today. I had no trouble getting this on, but it seems to not work with my body type. It's still too loose for my liking. Too long and it kind of flared out too much at the end. Still a nice dress, just not for me!


thick material, but I prefer more stretchy.


i'm 5', 140lbs- ordered a medium - way too small.


I loved it and the material was so soft and nice . Fits perfect !! Thanks so much . Will order from this vendor again


Perfect dress and amazing quality.  I purchased this dress to wear at my baby shower next week and I am not disappointed.  I do wear a size M/L and ordered a L. It does fit a bit tight, but it also smooths out all my imperfections .


I love this dress. The material is more of a medium weight so it's not too thin like some of the other dresses from Tom's Ware. I'm 5'6" and 120 lbs. and the XS fits me perfectly.


This dress is so comfortable and I received so many compliments!  I was going back and forth with what size to get and I finally decided on the XS/S  (my measurements are 32/24/38).  The sleeves were a little loose, but it wasn't such a big deal.  I might order more in different colors!


In love with this dress!!! I'm 5'2 , 100 lbs and this fits perfect!!


I love the color of the dress but it's very see through and not very flattering. I much preferred the fit of the floral dress.


So comfortable and also flattering. I like that it isn't too revealing but it is still beautiful!
