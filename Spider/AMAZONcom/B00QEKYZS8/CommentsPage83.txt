I'm 5'3", 135 lbs and purchased a M.  Too small for my taste.


I absolutely love this dress. The fabric is nice and thick, the picture looks exactly the same, and it fits sooooo perfectly. I'm 5'3, about 145-150lbs, and the medium fits great-nice and tight if that's the way you like it.


Cute but too big


I always read reviews before I place orders, the good reviews and bad ones too so I am able to make good selections.  This was another great choice.  I wear it to church.  It is figure hugging but decently so.


The dress fits perfectly. I'm a size 10-12 dress but 14-16 pants and the large size fits perfectly. I am always self conscious about my stomach and it 70% hides it, all I need is the girdle to hide the other 30% lol. Overall I LOVEEEEEEE the dress!


Nice dress, comfortable, and colors pretty close to actual dress! It has a great fabric, not thin, not thick, and a great level of stretch. Love it!


I bought this to wear around Easter/Spring.. I loved the quality and the way that it fit.. Stretchy but not too stretchy..


Cute and good price!


I love this dress, the colors were really vibrant. I was afraid they would be faded. It runs small though. Unfortunately I have to return the size medium for an extra large.


Form fitting on a very petitte woman...who looked HOT! in it.
