I ordered a M and I am 5'2" 135# and it was skin tight. It was a nice length but I don't like such a body hugging fit.


Gorgeous color and fit! It is a vavavoom dress. I am 5'10 , 175 lbs and hippy and the medium/large fit perfectly! Be ready to be checked out if you buy this. Just a word of warning, I bought the same dress in black and coral, in the same medium/large size and they both were too big. The sizes seem to vary by color for this product but I am THRILLED with the flower turquoise one I kept!


LOVE IT, IT FITS GREAT HUGS ALL MY CURVES. I WAS CONCERNDED BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE TOO SMALL AND TIGHT. NOPE, IT FITS FINE I AM 5'6 AND WEIGHED 200 AND I ORDERED THE LARGE.


It's very cute and exactly what I expected. I'm glad I bought it just waiting for the summer weather to start.


Get 2 sizes bigger. This dress is way too tight.


Love this dress


This is the most perfect thing that is ever graced my closet. I will now buy all of them!!!


The first one I ordered was to small, ordered the next size and it for perfectly.


I got a medium and it fit perfectly! I am 5'4" and weigh 135 pounds.  I loved the expression on my husbands face when I tried it on.  Definitely a keeper!


LOVED IT!!!! Ordered a size up than I useually wear and its so perfect!
