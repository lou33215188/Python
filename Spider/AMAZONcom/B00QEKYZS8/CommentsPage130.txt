I'm 5'2, 184 & curvy. I bought this exact dress in 5 different colors, size large..love the material, how it fits, & especially how it hugs my curves..worth every penny.


cute dress but was large for the size.


I'm 5'7'' ~145 lbs, generally a 6 in dresses, and ordered the Medium. It fit perfectly!  Love this dress!!


The only con is it's hand wash.


Amazing dress!  Fit like a glove


I am 5'10 and 165. I got this dress to match my girls for Easter. I got the M/L and while it looks great and fits perfect for date night it may be a little sexy for church.


I love this dress! Its beautiful and the fit is perfect!


A gorgeous dress, but not suitable for work because it is quite curve hugging. Even wearing a long business jacket over it does not really help. Save it for a night out or a summer day in the park.


Love the material, beautiful print!


Looked very pretty but too small (small to medium was actually small)  Label said Navy but the dress was black.  Sent it back.


Did not like the look.
