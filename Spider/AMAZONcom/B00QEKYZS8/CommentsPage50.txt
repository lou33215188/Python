Won't last long, began to weather by the lap. After only 3 times being used


Really Really cute!! I'm 5'6 and 128lbs - 32D.  I normally wear a small. Occasionally a medium. The medium is perfect! I got the aqua flowers and it looks so great on. I will for sure be purchasing more.


I am 5ft 6, 160lbs, curvy and ordered a Large. I think it's a gorgeous dress! Fits snug but the materi is thick enough that shapewear isn't noticeable underneath. A thick belt looked nice with it too. Very flattering.


I liked the dress but is was just too snug on my post baby body.  I returned the dress.


I LOVE MY DRESS!!! It fits perfect, good fabric, it accentuates curves without being tacky. Nice dress, got many compliments. ;-)


Although I bought a size too big ( size L/XL is really n extra large, keep that in mind. I gave it to my sister who is truly a size  extra large. Will be ordering every color once in stock. The material is thick enough for all season and thick enough if you have to wear spanks. Some material show the spanks through, this wont. Great buy!


The dress material is thicker so it's not see through which is nice. The neck part runs a little large. But I do like the way the dress looks on me all in all cute dress!


Truly a very nice fitting dress.  I am 114 lbs and purchased the small.


the neckline is pretty wide so it shows more cleavage than you would guess based on the product picture. it's cute though.


Beautiful dress!  Fits great, true to size.  I'm 5'3, 120 lbs, and a S fits great.  Super soft.  One of the few sheath dresses that is comfortable sitting down.
