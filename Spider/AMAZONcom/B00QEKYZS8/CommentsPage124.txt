Tighter than anticipated & very see through. Need some very good undergarments to wear this dress.


Perfect dress for blonds......just a sweetheart of a dress...im doing a fund raiser for rahu the elephant that cried while being rescued.....i am glad i have this dress to be enfront of so many people...its perfect. Runs small so girls order i size bigger... It does not stretch a lot...but is so cute!


Love this dress! I ordered a S/M but it came as a M. That was a little confusing but it fits great! Nice/thick material!


The fabric is very soft and comfortable. I receive many compliments on this dress.


My dress came in today and it fit so prefect. The fabric was great too, not that cheap material people sell online. I am definitely buying more dresses from here. I love the dress


I'm a size 6 and the medium was too small in the thighs. I'm considering exchanging it.


Very sexy fit on my 5ft 7in frame. Ordered the large.


Nice fit , although they sent me an extra large instead of a large but I still fit it just a little more room around the waist . I decided to order a large in the dark navy flower print .


Just got this today and I LOVE IT!! I want one in every color. I was really nervous about the sizing after reading the reviews.  I'm 5'6 130lbs and ordered the small/medium (I typically wear a size 4 dress). The tag says it is medium and the fit is amazing! It is stretchy material and super comfortable!


100% satisfied with my purchase, the quality of the dress  was above satisfactory for this price.
