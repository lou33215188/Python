Beautiful dress! The fabric feels high quality and the price is so much more reasonable than that of LLR! I highly recommend these dresses and will be purchasing many more!


The fabric is snug but not so tight it shows every wrinkle and crease underneath it. I'm 5'3'' and the dress hits just below my knees if it's all the way pulled down. So comfy. And the pattern is very flattering. Highly recommend.


I had to order a double X-large and I'm not even fat! But it's very pretty and comfortable dress once you get the right size.


So cute! Long enough aND flattering to the figure!


it is a beautiful dress but it has little to no stretch at all.


Perfect. Quality material, size appropriate, and didn't shrink or become misshapen after washing/drying. I just ordered a second dress in a different color. I completely recommend this.


I am 5ft 5, 180lbs and i got a XL. Love this outfit, the material  is stretchy and can pull up when you walk but I managed to make it work. Wore it to church with a blazer on top of it. Will def be ordering more colors


This dress is really cute, just the right amount of stretchy.  I ordered a large and they sent a medium - so I could get it on and off, and if I sucked in my gut it looked okay.  I ended up giving the dress to a skinnier friend.


I loved wearing this dress! I'm curvy and it showed in this dressğŸ˜Š


Great fit, looks cute on, thick material that doesn't show all your "lady lumps" but form fitting as you would expect. My fiancÃ© loved it, I wore it on valentines day for our date.
