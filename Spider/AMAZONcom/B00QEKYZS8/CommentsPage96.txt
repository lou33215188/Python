The size is WAY too small.  I ordered the XL and it fit's like a size 8.


Disappointing!


It fit very nicely. My measurements are 35a,30,38 and I'm 5'6" and I weigh 137lbs. I purchased a large.


I thought the floral would be sickening in person, but I actually really like it. The pattern does sort of look like it was made from repurposed curtains or couch upholstery. Kind of like wearing grandmas sexy curtains.


The dress hugs your body perfectly. The material that the dress is made from is thick which I like because I am a full figured woman.


I ordered this dress after reading reviews & get one size up of what I usually wear. It is perfect fit to me and the material is also of a good quality according to its price. I would like to buy it again in different colors. I am 5.7 and this dress is not a midi dress as it says. It is above my knees.


Very pretty,  prefect fit and I get a lot of complements when I wear it. I will order it again with a different print.


The wife loves it :)


Fits great!! The black isn't as dark as in the picture. It's more of an ashy black.. thats why I give 4 stars instead of 5...other than that, it's a great dress!!


I ordered a small and the dress was perfect! I am normally a small in women and medium/large in juniors!


Love the dress! It fits as I hoped it would, (I'm 5'5 and 120 - ordered a s/m) the only thing is that the sleeves are a little big. I thought they would be tight around my arms, but they are pretty loose. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase.
