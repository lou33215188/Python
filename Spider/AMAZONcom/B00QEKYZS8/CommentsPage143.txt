Love the dress, I normally wear a size 8 and I ordered a Medium, when it arrived the tag read medium/large and I thought it might be big on me but it was not, it fit perfectly, it hugs your curves without being too clingy, I would recommend this products for women of any age.


LOVE this dress! Very flattering fit.


Wife looked so good in this


Loved the way it fit and looked. Ordered another in different color. Order a size up. It is snug.


very comfortable


Beautiful dress, quality material. It does run a full size small, though. I am a size 6 and usually wear a M but had to get a L in this dress.


My new favorite dress!! so comfy and sexy


Love this dress. I am 7 months pregnant and it fits perfectly. I bought one size bigger. It looks just like the picture and the material is not too thin. I will be buying one more =)


The dress is cute and a much nicer quality than I've ever seen from discount clothes made in China. Follow the sizing instructions and you should be good. I rounded up to the next size because of my experiences with other sellers. It fit looser than I expected but I could have made it work if it wasn't way too long. I'm 5'8" and this dress hit mid calf on me. I expected it to go a couple inches below my knees, not almost to my ankles. If the color I really wanted wasn't sold out in my size I would have exchanged it instead of returning it.


I love this dress. I have it in multiple colors.
