yes, it fit my girlfriend excellent.


she also loved the color


Wonderful dress, love!! I sized up because of the reviews I read, you really don't need to.


The overall dress was nice but somehow the patterning (black floral print) made me look pregnant, not just a little, a lot pregnant. It was kind of magical how big it made me look. I'm not pregnant, at all. 5'9" and fluctuate between 150-160 so it's not like I have a crazy huge belly. It was mesmerizing. I tried it with spanx as well and I still looked pregnant, it was mind boggling.


I thought the fabric was a really nice weight and had a nice feel to it. The dress hit at a really nice length. I was pretty sad that it didn't work out.


I love the both of them. So I returned them for the next size up.


Excellent buy.


I ordered this dress in black. Just received it today and it has such a strong chemical smell to it.


Beautiful dress but runs 1 size too small so order a size up.  Not much stretch to the dress.  Very flattering and attractive


I'm 6 months pregnant. 160 pound and it fit awesome!!! Ordered a large


great color,  fitted dress, hugs your curves


Pretty but fit like a 12 instead of 16-18 or Extra Large.
