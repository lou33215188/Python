I absolutely loved it! It hugged my entire body the right way and fit like a glove. I ordered a small.


Love it!  So cute and sexy!


My wife likes it and she looks great in it but it hugs the curves for her to wear anywhere but on a date with me( so she says ) she is 5'


6" and 130 lbs


It is OK dress but curve hugging. You have to have wash board abs to wear it. Nice with skirt as a blouse


This dress fit perfectly. I love it!!


Love love


The came just as described amd the print is beautiful!! I am a size 18 and ordered a XL and the fit is great!


Gorgeous dress! Material is a bit thicker than expected but that was a plus! Received sooooo many compliments that I decided to purchase the same dress in another color (so I can wear for the Fall season).


I am 148-150, 34D, 5'5" and I ordered the S/M. Perfect. Perfect.


Dress was ok, but im very petite and the size small was too long on me and not as form fitting as i would have liked. The polyester fabric isnt my favorite.


Great quality dress, I'm in love with the way my wife looks in it ğŸ˜�
