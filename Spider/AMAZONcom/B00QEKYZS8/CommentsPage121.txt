I love love this dress! I am 253 lbs and 33 weeks pregnant and the xl/XXL was perfect. It's body hugging but hides all the unwanted spots. Not to mention it's so comfy. Will be wearing it for my baby shower, can't wait. I got it in black and couldn't be happier.


I am 5'6" and a fit 158 lbs and it fits great. So comfortable and cute. In fact I loved the fit and price I bought 4 more dresses from Toms Ware. I love them.


I’m 5’6” 155-160lbs lol...  and I ordered the Medium. It fit perfectly. I’ll definitely be ordering in a few more colors!


Dress fit great. It's pretty tight, but that's what I expected. Material is thick enough to not be sheer. Shoulders on the dress are a little wide on me, I'm pretty petite though, other people may not have this problem.


This dress is great!  The material is thicker so it conceals a lot.


I loved the dress and style.  Unfortunately its way too tight.  It fits more like a medium than an XL.


Fit perfect, and looked exactly like the picture. Why pay Lularoe prices????


super small!


I love this dress. But it rides up a lot through out the night. Wish it had more stretch and stayed out. But overall good deal and beautiful flower print!


Pretty dress.
