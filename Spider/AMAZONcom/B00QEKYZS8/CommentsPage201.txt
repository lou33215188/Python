Wonderful dress, I ordered a 2x I'm 190 5"2 its knee length, good fit not to clingy but shows curves!


My wife loves the dress and her figure looks great in it. Happy wife happy life


Love it just what i wanted


Cute dress but a little small I got Large/XL and still a little too fitted so I ordered up and will return it


I got a large and it does run small so it was a perfect fit it looks so cute with a white blazer or a jean jacket


I wish I loved this dress as much as I was hoping too.  It just isn't what I expected.


Hella huge!


Got a small and it was outragiously huge


I love my 2 dresses I purchased. I  will continue to shop with Tom's Ware.


fits the body perfect
