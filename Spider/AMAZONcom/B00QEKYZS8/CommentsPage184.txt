Good quality and fits like a glove!  My husband loves it.


Loved the speed of delivery, the fit, the texture, everything


Dress was huge!


Beautiful dresses


It is super cute, can't wait to wear it.


Ummmm the "Coral" color is actually a cotton candy pink. I will be returning this dress. Not what I expected at all. Shipping was terrible.


Cute but wide in the shoulder


Great buy...the material is thick and nice. As soon as my size is available in black I'm getting another one.


It fits perfect and I love it. Never got so many compliments from people I don't even know. Love it.


Color not the same and ordered s/m fits more like a M
