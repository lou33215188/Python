Based on the other reviews I ordered a Medium/Large. I'm 5'9 143 lbs (and a little out of shape right now!) I usually where an American small or medium and 6 or 8. When I got it, I noticed the tag says Large, so I got a little nervous, but it fits great! I just need to wear Spanx with it to smooth out my "our of shapeness" :-)  It is a great length, I will definitely order more!


Cute style and love the pattern, but sizing is way off.


Nice dress. Looks pretty on my wife. Material is heavier than expected.


Such a pretty dress.  I'm  5'10" 174lbs and it fits great.  Thought the material would be thin but it's not.  Such a great price for this.  I might get it in different colors.


Comfy stretchy soft


I love this dress and always get lots of compliments when I wear it! Fits as expected and I'm a size 12/14 with a big booty.


Dress was smaller than expected, still fits but don't think it'd be appropriate for work.


I ordered Xl-XXL expected to get in an Xl yet got a XXL wrong size not sure how they pick the size for you? Lol IT FITTED OK YET THREW OUT THE DAY IT STRECTH TO THE POINT IT BEGING TO LOOK TO BIG. Didn't take a picture didn't like the way it fitted after a few hours of wearing it. So I trashed it Must have for the price In the right size


It's a cute dress but I wish I'd ordered the size up. I am 5'8, weighing 135 and I'm a size 4. It's a bit snug for my taste, I may give it away versus sending it back.


Love the dress! Perfect fit!
