Fits great. Great material. A little big but I can still wear it


This is a great dress. True to sizing. Do not hesitate to buy it.


I ordered it as XS and fitted to big ğŸ˜¡


I really love it


Love it


I am 5 ft and 115 lbs and i ordered a small...fits perfect. Love this dress, great fabric as well


Great fit! Wasn't sure to expect from this type of sizing. Snug and below the knee just what i was looking for.


Not What I Expected To Be


Love the fit and the color.


Not true to size. Runs too big.
