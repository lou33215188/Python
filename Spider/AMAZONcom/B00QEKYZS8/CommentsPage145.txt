I look so cute in this dress. My mother and cousin bought the same and they look equally fantastic and we all have different bod shapes.


Strange fit, but could be nice for price.  It flares slightly at the bottom, which doesn't really go with the style of the rest of the dress.


Cute, cute, Cute!


Very pretty ... Love it!


Very sexy dress


It is a beautitful dress. I love it. If i was more fit it would look better though


This dress made of nice thick fabric. I ordered this dress but it was too, was hoping to just replace it with a bigger size but the only option I got from the seller was to get a refund and that's disappointing.


Cute dress but definitely it is the true xl that I ordered. The only thing that I did not like was instead of the bottom fitting tight it flares a little bit.


Very nice. Good material, form fitting.


i got the 2XL - as it translated to a American XL. I am a size 14-16.  Fit perfectly.  Not too tight, not too loose.  Body hugging, but not so tight it is too revealing.  Very well made, well stitched & cut.  The fabric is amazing.  It's a polyester ponte style knit. It is tightly woven, just the right thickness.  It isn't see thru, or revealing of lumps & bumps or underwear.  The fabric is amazing...the color & pattern even more pretty.  Bright, clear floral.  this is sexy, dress up or dress down.  Great of the office or a date.  I am amazed at the quality & style.
