This dress is beautiful,  but casual weekend wear, not for office work or a party.


This dress was super comfortable and perfect for my baby shower! Would definitely order again. I ordered a large and am 5’5” and weigh 170 lbs (33 weeks pregnant).


This dress fits like a glove. I'm 5' and weigh 155. I ordered a size large. The material is nice and thick. I bought this dress to add to my office wardrobe and just might buy a couple more. Beautiful print.


Love it Love It Love It!!!!!!! This dress is amazing


Really great dress, fits well nice material.  Only wish it was a V-neck


Beautiful color but fits way too small.


I really like this dress but it is a little tight in the bust area. If your chesty you might need to go up a size.


I'm satisfied by my purchase :) the quality of the dress is perfect and I absolutely love the color :) I didn't had to wait to long to get my package all the way in Asia <3


Fit and looks great! I liked it so much I bought one in a different color.


I'm 5'3" and 135lbs, ordered a small/medium and it fits perfectly!
