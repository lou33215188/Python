Fast shipping, Nice fabric, fit body okay with a Medium, however the length was too long for my taste. I am 5'7 and the length came several inches past my knee. Returning, but will look at other styles from Tom's.


Love love love this dress. Great quality material for the price! It can be dressed down with a clean pair of a converse & a denim jacket or dressed up with the right accessories & pumps.


Great fit, love the colors! The image is exactly what you get.


Ordered a size up and it was still too tight. Sizing chart is way off. Will not order from them again. Returning.


Nice dress.!Good fit except for the arms. Arm holes are big


Very pretty dress. Nice quality.


If you're a person who loves to show off your curves but not in a rounchy way then this is the perfect dress for you. Im so in love with this dress. Also good quality material.


Cute cute cute.  A nice casual summer dress I love it.


I'm 5'9 and 125 lbs. I ordered an x-small/small and this dress was way to big for me. The fabric was weird to me and the seam was not uniform.


Iâ€™m in absolute love! Fits perfectly, feels amazing, I feel good in it! May buy 1 in every color!
