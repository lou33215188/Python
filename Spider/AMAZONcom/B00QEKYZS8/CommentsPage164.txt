Very cute, fabric is soft.


Thicker than I thought. It actually is a size smaller than requested


I'm 5'11 and it was just to short for me. And I don't really like the fabric


Love this dress


Fit  perfect and great material


I LOVE this dress, it fits nicely and is very comfortable.

Beautiful dress


Nice dress...Nice fit!!! It's tight, but not too tight. I am 5'4 142 lbs and I ordered M/L because I didn't want it to be too tight. It fits nicely


Great dress but runs about 2 sizes small. I reordered.
