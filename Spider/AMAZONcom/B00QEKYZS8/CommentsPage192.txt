Absolutely loved this dress.....I am ordering it in other colors


I love it so sexy


The material for this dress feels quality and I loved the floral design.  However, it fits me very poorly, which doesn't reflect on the quality, just that it was not a good fit for my body type.  I am a slim 5', with a small bust and wider hips. The shoulder opening was  too wide and the chest and torso area fit was too large.  I ordered a small size.


Beautiful dress! Fits well! I love it!


Fits me well Loveeeee it can't wait to where it out


Nice


I normally wear xl but this is extremely form fitting and didnt seem to have much stretch to get it on. The white when its so tight is see through. I'll be returning and ordering the xxl in green because i do like the dress. Its not as soft as lularoe but its a fraction of the cost.  Hopefully it will work better in the larger size.


Absolutely LOVE this dress!


I ordered this because all the reviews said the sizing is very small. Not at all. The XS is still quite big. Actually bigger than the SX/Small of the other model, with the hood, which instead fits me fine.


Love the dress..fits like a glove


Love the material


Super  sexy


Will order more
