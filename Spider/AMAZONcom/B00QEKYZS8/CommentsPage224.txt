Very pretty print.  Large is still a little tight for a size 12 body.  Will keep, however.  Hits mid to just below knee on my 5'7" frame.


Although the fit was a bit small, I love the dress. I wore it with a linen blazer for business meetings - perfect!


Soft fabric and pretty pattern. Fits my hourglass body without being tight. Comfy and cute, my husband wanted me to wear it for him on date night.


Love this dress and it feels amazing on. Unfortunately it's a bit tight in the hip area.


Love it. Fit and length is perfect. I'm about 5'3 and 150lbs. Very cury and bootyful. Lol. I got size medium.


Runs small.


Nice dress for the money. Can't beat it.


Nice enough, but women's sizes generally vary wayyyy too much.  One 2xl can be as small as another L.


Looks great on me.  Glad I got the M because it's very form fitting.


After the first wash, â€‹it looked like it had been worn a few times.
