My most favorite dress ever! I feel very beautiful and sexy wearing it and it is shows my curves. Received so many complements. Definitely a winner! :)


Nice dress. Was a bit to big


Very tight fit but I love it for my curves!!!!! My boyfriend loves it also :)


What was I thinking?


great basics dress!


Like how it fit the cut and everything


I have a couple Tom's Ware dresses and this one is just poorly made. Too big and the fabric is thick (which is good) but not very stretchy. Disappointed in this one for sure.


Perhaps I just am not brave enough.  This was skin tight, I mean it!  The colors are great, but the dress fit like an exam glove.  My husband told me to take it off and get rid of it.  I'm not fat--or I don't think of myself as such.  I weigh about 130 pounds and am 5'3".  Maybe that is in the overweight range for this dress.


Dress is horrible and cheap looking.


Returning it for a full refund.


great buy
