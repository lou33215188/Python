Love this dress. Goes almost to my knead and I'm 5'8 with curves!! Dress looks great. Soft and I always get compliments


Love it!


I love this dress! It's very flattering. I wore it for date night this weekend and got lots of complements.


It fits nicely into the body a little thin fabric, but looks good


Got this in the mail last night. I ordered the black floral print. I'm 5'2" 122 lbs and the small fit me perfectly! Soft thick fabric with tons of stretch! It looks great on and I can't wait to wear it out!


Love it! Same shape as LLR, stretchier material. Wish sleeves were a bit longer, but still great!


I'm a 38d. 155 pounds and I had to get the x large which fits very nicely


Perfect


Cute


5ft 120 lbs the dress  falls below my knees perfect for work.
