Fits very well and the material is breathable and durable.


Cute dress


I don't really like the pattern in person. Too floral. It fit as expected, though.


I bought this for my daughter who was 8 months pregnant and it for perfect and looked really good on her. Quality waa great.


I love this dress. I have curves and feel like this dress does me justice. It's incredibly comfortable, and has become a go-to date night dress. I also wore it to a friends wedding and got tons of compliments. I'll probably order more in different colors because it fits so well.


Love it


I am si in love with this dress I am a small girl.. only 5" with petite body figure but this dress really fits me good the material really is a good quality and thick. It doesn't shows any panty lines. So comfortable to wear.


Love this dress! It is a little tight but I find the fit to be very flattering. I am 5'6" and 195lbs and the xl fits great and is super comfortable. I've ordered 2 more!


I bought this dress because I thought it was perfect for work and also comes in the size xs, so I ordered it.


However when I received it, its way too big me :( I'm not very pleased with the sizing so make sure you take note of that before ordering.


I had to return due to it being too small.  It wasn't the length I hoping for.  The sleeves were tight as well.  Super cute but not made for plus sized gals.
