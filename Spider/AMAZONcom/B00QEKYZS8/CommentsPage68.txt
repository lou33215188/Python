Sizes run smaller than shown....


I get compliments when wearing this. It is long.  I bought it large enough not to be too form fitting. I use it in layering.  The florals are a bit larger than I like in person but it is a pretty dress.


I am 9 mos pregnant and ordered a large. I could have fit into a medium. I had to keep pulling it down throughout the day. But it is a satisfactory purchase.


I did not like how this dress made my body look at all.


Perhaps I am just too skinny? I am 5'2 and weight 118 pounds so I got a small hoping it would be a tight fitting dress. But it felt like a medium


not for someone with big belly


I like the dress. It is a slim fit, so if you have a stomach like I do it is not flattering. So maybe wear a slimmer underneath


I bought the dress color that's displayed.  This is a nice, comfortable material.  However, the colors on this dress look cheap.  I didn't return this in time.  I'm not sure if I'm going to wear this.


Nice dress, on the 'fitter' side, not much give.....gained weight, lowest was 145...but currently 5'4, between 155-160, but still a little fit, bottom tight size 6, almost refuse to buy bigger....ordered M/L and fits perfectly, even camouflage my little pudge...working on that, lol!!!


My wife was very happy with this dress
