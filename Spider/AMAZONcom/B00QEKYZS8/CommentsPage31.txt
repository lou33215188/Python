Fit as expected for my significant other.  At first I was worried as the dress showed up as a medium, but I ordered S/M, but everything fit fine.  She normally wears a 4-6 in women's dress sizes, and the S/M fit her perfectly.


She says the fabric is quite comfy, and is thick enough so the dress isn't see-through.


All of the reviews that I read prior to buying stated that the dresses ran small, and advice from Tom's customer service directly was to order up. I am a 14-16 and was told to order an XXL. Fits snugly - as one would expect a bodycon dress to - but the cut is otherwise flattering and the quality excellent. Follow the advice and order up to have a successful wearing experience! I definitely wear my spanx to smooth out the bumps on this one, but the dress is SO comfy


This dress is true to size. I ordered a medium which is a little long but I can sew and it's a little big but that's O.K. I gained weight and as soon as I loose this fat I can easily take it in. This is a real pretty dress.


I bought this hoping it would be similar to a Lularoe Julia.  It totally does the trick!  The neckline is a little more scooped than I'd prefer, so I will keep looking, also - but the fit is good and I was pleased that the fabric was a little beefier than your typical ray/span jersey.  Its more like a terry cloth.


I'm 5'11" and 150lbs - I ordered a Large so it wouldn't be skin tight and am pleased with how it fits.


Soooooooooo comfortable and cute. The neckline is cut a bit low if you're busty, but I could see it being a professional cut for someone with a smaller bust. I just wear it as a non-work dress. I would buy one in every color if my closet would fit them.


I bought a s/xs and it fits perfectly. For reference, I'm 5ft3in tall,122 lbs, and have a 26.5in waist. This is my third Tom's Ware dress and they always fit me great.


Nice dress nice material but it's runs big I ordered i size up because of the reviews I read n the dress was to big I suggest a size down if u want a fitted dress if you want it loose order a size up I ordered a 2x n it to Big next time I'm ordering a extra Large I like my clothes fitted


Beautiful dresses..  instead of buying one for now...I took my chances and I bought 12 dresses in different solid color and floral pattern. I purchased the dresses Based on reviews,went with XXLG. they were Too small /tight in chest/belly area,although nice length right below knee...  .very disappointed they did not fit ğŸ˜�. since I do not like returning anything I buy online,I am going to give them away (or attempt to shed some pounds so I can enjoy wearing them myselfğŸ˜ƒ. )  Dresses can be worn during spring and summer, possibly even early fall with shrug or sweater.


I was a bit suspicious of getting this dress because of the low price. I expected low quality. But this dress is stunning! I got it in beige. It's more like an ivory yellow color, but I love yellow so it worked out. I haven't taken it off all day. :)


Llllllllloooooooovvvvvvveeeeeeee. Want one in every color.
