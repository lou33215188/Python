My dress like  this looks like a  big t-shirt, does not look like the dress posted


I received the wrong color, but it was nice, so I kept it.  Fits nicely, lots of compliments.


Material is stretch and fit nice.


I LOVE IT. It's soft, comfortable, lovely.


For some reason, this color just doesn't stretch? I bought two and the other color did stretch a little so it's not tight but this one just doesn't?


I absolutely love this dress. I purchased size L, as I am fairly curvy (busty and hippy). This dress accentuates all my curves and really fits nicely. The material is very good quality. I plan to order more colors.


nice and look good


Dress is so pretty, fits like a glove, material is thick not see through. Can't wait to wear it and look forward in purchasing more dresses. Thanks


I love this dress


I love this dress. Its comfortable and it fits well. Im very curvy. I about 5'3" 200 lbs and i bought a 2x. The dress is a little below my knee. Im thinking about buying it in another color.
