I love the quality of this dress


Don't let the name fool you, this is my boyfriend's account but we share it and I pay for my orders--I just like to keep track of them. To give you a little perspective, I'm picky about dresses, since as a child I was a fierce tomboy and hated anything with a skirt. I live and work on a dairy farm and also work for a dog rescue. So when I'm not covered in sweat, mud, and other unpleasantries, I like to clean up nice and look like a knock out. 9 times outta 10, my boyfriend (who cleans up well, too) would agree with me. He just smiles to himself when we're in public, usually at a gun show,  as I provide competent arm candy.


I ordered this dress a few days ago and am very pleased with the promptness of shipping, just not my local FedEx driver, but that's besides the point.


I am pleased to say that a Medium fits me perfect, snug but still enough room to wiggle and function. I am about 5'5", a 35" bust, 30" waist, and 38" hip. My only disappointment is that the picture for the "Black" dress betrays the cool hues, and I am fonder of warmer color schemes. It's a minor detail and the dress is still beautiful, so I am pleasantly satisfied with this purchase.

I legitimately teared up when I put this on, so. I'm in love with this dress, and I'm actually quite picky about dresses. Thank you so much!


Cute dress that is flattering!


I love it.


my boyfriend gave me this dress for my birthday and i do love it i would have liked it to fit just a bit shorter but other than that is great!
