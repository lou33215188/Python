Bought this dress for Easter while 17 weeks pregnant. It looked great and the material was high quality and had great stretch!


Size is perfect!  Dress is comfy and simple so you can put it with many accessories!  Dress it up or down.


Fit as expected... I love it!!!....ğŸ˜�


Absolutely stunning and fits really well. Material is super soft and very flattering! Love it!


order size up - fits tight but look great


Love it! I'm 218 pounds 42-35-46 measurements. I normally wear a XL but I went a size up (2X) and it fits perfect. I ordered a size up because I was going for a sophisticated look. The material is thick and not see through. I ordered the gray and I love it.


Although I would have liked the material to be a little thinner its a great dress.  I gotten so many compliments and the fit is wonderful.


I'm usually a size 10 and ordered an x-large because I read all reviews. It fits perfect around the chest and hips but wish it was a little tighter around the waist. Overall, the dress fits and looks beautiful.  I received a lot of compliments and I can dress it up or down and it is always comfortable.


But I still love this dress!


I love this dress so mush that I wore mine out last summer and just bought another one of the exact same color combinationğŸ‘�ğŸ�»ğŸ˜‚ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ˜�.
