The mid section is very fitted, while the neck scoops too low.  I probably cannot wear this to work, which is what I got it for.  You can tell it isn't very high quality material.  I am 5'3" and an athletic build- if you are tall and very slender this dress might work better for you.


I'm so in love with this dress.  It's beautiful!  I'm 5'5, size 14.  The Dsl fit great and hits at the knee.  Perfect for a summer wedding.


Got several compliments when I wore this to work.  Nice fit and nice material


The dress is perfectly lovely. I just felt like wall paper in it ;-) so back it went.


Pretty dress, but size is pretty off. I'm a medium and I ordered a large just to be safe. I almost wish I'd ordered an extra large, cause it's pretty body con.


Really good quality material and dress. Print is exactly as seen on here. Stretches well. I usually wear xl and the xl fits perfectly. Really happy with my purchase.


Love these dresses. I bought three of them. Fit amazing.


LOVE this dress! It's so gorgeous! Be warned, though: if you have a bit of a gut and/or muffin top, it's going to show so shapewear is a good idea.


Very nice dress, the material is great, but I should have gotten a Medium/Large. I thought if I got a large it would fit me fine but it's actually big on me and on top of it I received an X-Large. It's not tight on me at all, but I can make it work with a nice belt and shoes.


I love this dress. It is made of good material, and is very flattering. I have used it as a shirt a few times as well. I just folded the bottom half under and wore it with pants.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it. It is very comfortable and a great value for the price.
