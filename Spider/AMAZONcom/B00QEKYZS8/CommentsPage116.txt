Ordered a large to be on the safe side and still way too tight.


Super cute dress - can't beat the price! The material is surprisingly thick. This item definitely runs a bit small, so take that into consideration.


The sizing chart told me to chose small/medium. It fits and I'll wear it but I think I would have preferred the xsmall/small. I'm 5'4 about 127lbs athletic build. Material is great and I got lots of compliments. Overall very happy with it


flimsy material


Love this dress


I really like the color and fit. Although its a tad tight. I paired it with a little cardigan and a narrow belt so it became work appropriate.


I bought this dress in the Large size due to other people saying that the dress fit somewhat small. I found that the large was a bit roomy (I'm more bottom heavy than top heavy and the fabric was bunching up in certain spots). The dress is very comfortable and can easily be worn all day- it's like wearing a t-shirt. The dress also has breathable material so it's good for really hot days but can also be layered with a jacket when it gets colder. It's also a versatile piece- I first wore it with sneakers, then wore it with wedges for brunch and it looked great both times!


I love this dress! I got a large and was 6 months pregnant when I wore for a maternity shoot. So cute.


Very pleased. I have an hourglass figure and this fits like a glove. The material is soft and nice. I'm 5'9 and a small large in size, so this dress hits the top of my knee. I would have given it 5 stars but a was slightly disappointed  because  the dress colors are not as bright as the picture... still beautiful  and a great buy. Thank you Tom's  Ware.


Pattern looked cheap to me in person. And I usually wear a small but it was kind of bunchy with this one, so I returned.
