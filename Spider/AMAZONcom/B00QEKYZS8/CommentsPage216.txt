Super cute.  I'm kinda short so it ran a little long on me. But I love the dress still


if it fit I would love it, runs way too small compared to size I ordered


I love this dress! It is figure fitting and flattering. I ordered a Medium, I usually wear a size 6 and it fits great!


I’m 5’11”, 200 lbs and I got a 2XL. It’s a little baggy in the waist but fits perfectly otherwise. It comes down to just about my knees. This dress is BEAUTIFUL and the print is amazing. Well worth what I paid for it


Way too small! Too expensive to ship back so I'll give it to good will.


I adore this!  I kinda went back and forth between a small and a medium.... I was a bit nervous,  but this fits perfectly and is darling.  I'm a size 4/6, 34d, 25, 35.


Super fast shipping.


This dress is great, hugs curves, and not too sheer.


I ordered 2 dresses same style but different colors. Ordered size Xs/s  was sent one dress in size small and the other in size xs. That was so strange. And the size small is bigger than the size xs. I weigh 108lbs and both are tight. They are pretty dresses. Might wear leggings under them so they look like a tight top instead of a tight dress.


Order up


Wonderful dress!! I ordered an XL because I am 7 months pregnant. It was a little bigger than expected but turned out to be great because  I will be able to wear it as my belly gets bigger. The material is also quite thick and not see through at all! I love it.
