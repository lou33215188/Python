Worn as a maternity dress and fits great. I'm about 5'5" and got a medium


Love it, snug around my chest, but it has plenty of movemeny.


I am 5'3" and 159 lbs and this fit just fine. I returned it because the print was pretty but I just didn't like it on me. The dress was well made though and very nice.


Im 5'3 and 160lbs. I ordered the medium/large and it fit perfectly! Very flattering! A little see through so white undergarments are a must. If you have tattoos they will show through.


I ordered S but is large for me... Maybe my sizes ar the problem not the dress :)


I like the midi style and was hoping for a stunning look. Well it fits very small and the material is very thick and not stretchy so I felt like I can not breath. Returned...


This is By Far the best comfortable even more beautiful dress in person I' got so many complement from Strangers as well as friend and Families the quality exceeds my expectations  (coz the price) .


Yes I already recommended to everyone.


It doesn't fit like i would have hoped aroimd the neck and chest area. A little too loose.


Love this dress so much. Fits perfect. I'm 115 and got a small med. I love it! Many stylings to come


Way too thin and see-through, but fits so well and so comfortable that I kept it anyways and will wear a slip, tights or leggings underneath.
