beautiful dress


I kept it in hopes to fit it before the summer is over


I really love it.. I'm a Mary Kay consultant and It's perfect for my meetings In black


Love the dresses great fit


Without even trying it on I noticed it looked too late in the upper body part.


Luv it!!!


YUK! Horrible fabric. Looks like I put on grandmas drapes. returned it


Does look just like the pic . Quality and material is perfect . Thick enough , soft & comfortable .


In Asian sizes and very thin material


Love!!!
