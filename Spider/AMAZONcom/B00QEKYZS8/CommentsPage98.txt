dont even think about it! im buying them all im 5'0 140lbs and i got medium/large  i love this dress material is good fits great i might just buy larger size so it can be a little more loose around the stomach area other than that it still fits me perfect!!!


I returned it. I have narrow shoulders and fuller hips and thighs. It was too loose on the top and tight on the bottom.


beautiful midi dress. lightweight but holds in and does not show lingerie lines. will buy again. colour does not run when washed


Love this dress!!!!!


Cute pattern and dress, if it fit properly. Not stretchy at all. I ordered a size up because of the reviews, but still couldn't pull it down. Disappointed.


So other reviewers said this is a tight dress and it stretches which it does.  But not in a spandex way.  It will not suck you in at all so if you are going to wear it make sure you have some major spandex power going on.  other than that the dress came to just above my knees and i'm 5'9" and the pattern was the same as the picture


This is my second dress, I also have the blue. I love how it fits


Pretty dress but returned because it was way too tight. Sizing runs small.


Way too Big!! I usually wear a medium and thought maybe I may need a size up,but the Large felt like an X-large!


Arrived as expected
