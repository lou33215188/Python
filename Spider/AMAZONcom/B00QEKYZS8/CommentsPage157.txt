Great thick cotton stretch material. Fits like a glove. I'm 5'11 & 150lbs and ordered a medium.


Super cute! I'm 5'8 and 155. I got a medium and it is snug! Still super cute though. I will probably wear this going out for drinks, but definitely not for work.


Very pretty.  It is tight and you have to pull it off and on.  It is hard to take off.  But it looks great!


Cute but runs very small. I am returning it.


Perfect size. Perfect thickness to not have to worry of you are showing anything. Very good buy and will get in another color.


I LOVE IT BUT AM RETURNING IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO TIGHT ON ME ESPECIALLY AT THE WAIST & HIP AREA. I REQUESTED FOR MY SIZE {39, 36, 44 } IN INCHES TO BE SENT TO ME INSTEAD OF REFUNDING ME. BUT IF IT'S NOT IN STORE, THEN I WILL NEED MY REFUND. THE ABOVE MEASUREMENT IS  { BURST- WAIST- HIP} IN INCHES.


Very cute and sexy


The size chart is incorrect. The dress is way too small and I am unable to wear it. Too bad, because I like the look.


I love it.tThe material is soft but thick.


Got it yesterday, wore it today ordering another right now.
