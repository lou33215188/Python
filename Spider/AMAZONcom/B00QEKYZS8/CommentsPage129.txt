Very pretty and appropriate for work or going out.


Too big . I bought a size small. I had to return it. It fitted like a medium even tho the tag said "S"


My wife absolutely loved the material of the dress. She says it was a perfect fit also. Will be ordering more dresses of this kind for her very very soon!


Runs small so size up. Pretty colors and print.


This dress is made with really good quality. I wear a size 14 and ordered a 2XL, and it is so comfy and a perfect fit!


This dress is adorable!! I love it! I'll definitely be ordering it in a few more colors! It fit great


I'm giving it three stars because the case is beautiful, however the stones come off after 3-4 days of having it


love this dress. bought another one a few days ago in a different color. great fit and awesome quality.


I am 5'8 150lb and bought the medium. Fit great ...the dress is very well made and well worth the money ...I would buy from Tom's Ware again


I love the print and rest is just okay
