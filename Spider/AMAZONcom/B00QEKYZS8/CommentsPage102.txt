Great dress, strong cotton material. Great as a base for work or on the weekend


More heavy weight fabric than expected, not as much stretch as I would have liked.  Good quality it has made it through one wash and faired well.  I wear a size 16 and I ordered a 2x.  Snug body fit, very sexy.


Nice dress. Nice Fabric, only problem is I ordered a size too big. I wear a 12 in dress and could of order a large or even a medium,  very stretch material, but still nice quality


Perfect fit and great quality. I'm 5 months pregnant and was concerned this would be too tight and might be see through, but it stays put (doesn't ride up) and the material is high quality.


I love everything about these dresses. I ordered multiple. Being short and curvy, it's hard to find clothes I LOVE. And I do love these


The material is very thick. I ordered a small, I'm usually a sixe 0-1 and it was too tight! Returned.


Nice


Extremely flattering, thick material


Love this dress! I was worried about the fit, I've bought a dress in this style before and it didn't fit me right, it was too tight in the shoulder/bust area for me. I'm 5'3" and weigh 120. I ended up getting a medium and it fits great!


**UPDATE**


I now weight less and measure smaller: ~115 lbs., 33-28-36, wear Junior's Small and Women's XS. I wore this dress for the first time recently even though I bought it several months ago. This dress is now  slightly baggy on me, especially around the midriff. After walking around in it for a few hours, it started to ride up pretty significantly. Not sure if this is from it being a little baggy, or if it would've done this anyway. It didn't make the dress too short on me, but the bagginess made it look tacky. I predict that the X-Small/Small (their US X-Small/Asia Small) would be a better fit now.


**End Update**


I'm 5'2", ~125 lbs., 34-29-37, and I normally wear a Junior's Medium or a Women's Small. From the drop-down box, I ordered the Small/Medium (on the tag it says US Small/Asia Medium) and it fit me like a body-hugging Women's Small. I also tried on the X-Small/Small (their US X-Small/Asia Small) because their other dress styles fit me in that size, but for this style dress that size was way too uncomfortably tight and I could barely get it on. When I ordered the Small/Medium, the title of the dress in my cart then said US-M, which is wrong- it should have said Asia-M. So once you pick your size from the drop-down, ignore what the dress title is once it's in your cart. I'm not sure how the single sizes in the drop-down box work. My assumption would be that they are indicating the Asian sizes only because that is what the main tag on the dress says (so a drop-down Medium would be a on-the-tag US Small). The dress length falls right to my knees. The material feels like a slightly sturdier cotton fabric. I ordered the Black, Green, and Beige. All three patterns/colors are gorgeous in person and are just like the pictures. I'm not sure about whether panty lines would show through as I have only tried them on with thongs, but the pattern and the thickness of the fabric seem like they may hide some panty lines and the black and green hid my colored underwear. My nude bra showed through the beige one just a little- I think that this is due to my nude bra not being exactly close to my actual skin color. This dress is comfortable yet classy- I think it's a steal!
