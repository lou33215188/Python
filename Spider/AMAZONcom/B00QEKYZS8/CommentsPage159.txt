It fits great, the fabric is thick, so the line of the dress is very forgiving with your body shape. Totally loved it.


terrible way to small I ordered a xl, sizing way off


To large, boxy and I'm not entirely sure even taking it in will help :/ not happy.


I absolutely love this dress. It's comfortable and sexy. It looks great on me (not being conceited lol). I'm a curvy girl and this dress hugs my curves in all the right ways. Btw my boyfriend loves it too ;-)


Awesome dress!!


Ordered for my birthday but I think its is too baggy on me. I am 5'7" 216lbs and I ordered an xl . Still a very nice dress


Love it


Love, love, love this dress!!! I'm a size 14 and ordered a L/XL and it fit just right! Hugs every curve, so spanx is needed to make a smooth fit.


Love it!!!


Got here in perfect timing and fit exactly like I hoped it would
