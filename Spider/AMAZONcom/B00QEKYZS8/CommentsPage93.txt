I can see how some can think it's large, it looks realllly long out of the package. But on a slightly curvy woman...its a perfect fit. If you don't have much shape I would think of going smaller, and if you're a whole lotta woman than go bigger. The pattern hides all your nooks n crannies.


Fits at the knee and perfect for work and a jacket and after hours entertainment. Great quality material for the price.


This brand is a quality brand. It is nice, sturdy fabric and is well made. I would definitely order again.


Not quality. Print is as pictured.  Shape is a little difficult to wear.  Shoulders are big, waist is soooo tight. Would only be able to wear this on a perfectly bloat-less day.


Got a little pully after a few months but was beautiful till then


I love it


fits as described by everyone else, thick enough to hide lines but since its white its see through, be careful of that!


Cute, attractively designed pattern.  Pills quickly, so handwash it.


Nice decent material nice modest dress only thing is the neck line is somewhat loose. I ordered a small and I am 34 27 37


I love these dresses and get lots of compliments about them.
