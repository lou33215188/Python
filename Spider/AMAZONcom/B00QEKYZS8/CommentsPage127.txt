It's a little snug but love the length and the cut of the dress. Got a million compliments on it.


Best internet dress yet.


Small fits perfectly! [5'4", 107lbs] Lovely color and comfortable fit.


I may have to buy another!


Fit very well. 5 ft 7, size 4/6 and bought the m/l. Fitted but not too tight, very comfortable


LOVED IT.


Love the dress love the fit a d oh ya my Mr likes it too.


I like the dress! Not as stretchy as I expected but still has a great shape and length!


It's a cute dress but it was way too big on me


Fits a bit large in the torso, and  waist.  Fit would be better, hug curves more if there were more Lycra in the fabric.  If so I would really have liked it.  Nice fit in the legs style is very  straight line, falls smooth  not pencil style.  I am returning due to the fit.


I ordered one size bigger than I normally would and it fit perfect! Love this dress!


So cute on! I am a size 4-6 and ordered a small, fits perfectly!
