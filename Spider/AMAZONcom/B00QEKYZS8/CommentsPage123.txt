Super cute and good quality/elasticity! Would order more.


Beautiful fits very well


I weigh around 119-121 lbs, height 5'6 so I order a small and the size fits perfectly. It comes a little below my needs which is what I wanted! I love this dress, color and all.


Great for what it is. Fabric is synthetic and not very breathable. Overall it's soft and fine.


Had to wear it with a see-thru jacket.


This dress is very comfortable and made of quality material. I can wear to different occasions and I loved the price.


I tried this on hoping it would fit like the picture looks  but it definetly doesnt! I ordered a small and it swallowed me! Definetly not flattering, returning right away


I have ordered this dress in multiple colors. Very flattering.


I wasn't quite fond of it, but maybe someone else will be.


somewhat smaller than expected
