The fabric isn't too thin and the dress hugs my body accentuating all the right places.


Very happy with the quality. The fabric is thick and strong and the dress fits perfectly. I will certainly recommend this vendor and purchase from them again in the future.


Thick spandex material. True to size.


Good quality. Got a ton of compliments. Very flattering for any body type.


Good Material, And really pretty


Is slightly tight, but since it stretches that is fine.  Otherwise love it. :)


To big for an extra small, sending it back unfortunatly because the quality is nice and the style is very cute.


The length was too long and the fabric was heavier than what it appeared. I will be returning it.


I read all of the reviews, so I took a chance because there were many that were my size that said the XL-XML fit.  My hanging tag had 2X on it, but inside it has US size XL. It was too small and shows every bump!  I am so disappointed because the dress it self is adorable, with nice fabric.  I wish they made it in real plus sizes.  If so I would buy one of each print!


Cute dress
