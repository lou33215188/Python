The color was completely different than what I ordered. The pink is actually a hot pink and not a baby pink at all. I was super annoyed.


I just want to say I love this dress! It firm perfectly and I am a new mom. So when I wear this dress with a Spanx I look really good for having a baby. The dress quality is great and it came so fast !! Love love love


Very cute and very comfortable


Fits like a GLOVE!


sexy and cute - very body con!


Material and print are great! It's actual runs smaller size. Also, although I am 5'9, the lenght is perfect and for the office a little bit over the knees. Bought M size. Like it a lot!


Buy the dress!! Its worth the money, its thick and not see through. I can't wait to wear it out.


Great buy!


WoW!! Need to order more!  I love how it hugs me!


Love the dress and the print,the dress does run small :( I usually wear an XL,ordered a 2XL because of the stretchy fabric and it was still to snug.
