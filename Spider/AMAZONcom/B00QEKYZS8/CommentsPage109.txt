I'm 5'4 132lbs. I ordered a small but should have gone with a medium.  It fits but, I prefer a little more slack.  That's just me.  The dress looks wonderful.  Oh yeah, my "friend" LOVES IT.


Nice dress, tastefully made.


A little long.


Love it so much that several girls at work bought ones in other colors.


Pretty dress but polyester not rayon, as indicated.  Unfortunately. I cannot wear polyester..


6ft 148lbs. Tall (model) woman.  A problem with size nomenclature.  (XL) can be either USA, EU, or ASIA as it was in this case, ASIA, which is (L) in USA sizing.  Shoulders were too narrow for me.


I bought a large  5'6  38-29-40  I sized up cause I didnt want it super tight. i going to exchange for a med cause this is loose on me. Dress it great quality and not see through at all  will buy again from this line


This dress is surprisingly beautiful for the price. I purchased the white floral which is perfect for a Valentine's day dinner date in South Florida.


Loved it. fits perfectly


This dress hits every curve PERFECTLY!  very well made. Usually wear a 1x but reading the reviews i went up to a 2x. Fits like a charm! Not see thru and was a hit for my day time look for my vacation in LA!
