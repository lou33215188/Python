Was really hoping this dress was a little more form fitting, instead it's way too big for me, so I will be returning it. Nothing wrong with the dress, it is good quality. Just doesn't look as great on me as I thought.


Good fit


Thick material, good quality stitching, and the color is exactly as pictured, I love it!


the blue was not as soft and not as comfortable as the pink :-/ so I had to return it


Super cute and comfy. Wearing it today. I'm usually a medium, so I got medium/large (though the tag just says "large") because it matched my measurement. It fit perfectly!


I ordered this dress after reading reviews. Fits just as described. I'm six months pregnant so I ordered a size bigger than usual and it fit perfectly. The print also hides all of our perfect imperfections :)


Amazing dress. Get it if you want it. You won't regret it.


Could not find a size that fit.  It is a body hugger no matter the size.


Buy a size up from your normal size and you'll be happy!! Comfy and pretty.


It is a slim cut dress and after reading reviews, I went up from my normal small to a medium.  I'm glad I did; the dress fits like a glove.  A sexy glove but a glove nonetheless.  Not a dress you'd wear to the office :D
