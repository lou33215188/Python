Love it


Great dress. Very form fitting. I would go a side up unless u want in snug. Quality it great


Really nice quality!  Fabric is actually nicer than popular Lularoe Julia dresses but a little longer and cheaper!  Can't beat that.


I ordered this dress to wear for my birthday while 20 weeks pregnant. It has great stretch to it, but isnâ€™t see-through.


I was worried when it first arrived BC when I pulled it out the bag it looked Huge! I ordered a small. But when I tried it on the material conformed to my body like a glove. And the material is thick so that's great!


I ordered a M-L  but received a large. It was a tad too big and unflattering. (5'8" 133 lbs) it was big in the arms and big in the stomach area. If I turned to the side it didn't hug any curved. I feel like it only hugged to my most unflattering parts of my body- my hips.  I'm hesitant to reorder as it may just not fit my body as well as the other ladies who bought the dress.


As people have said, the dress probably fits a little larger than usual, but that was fine for me seeing as I'm a little larger/taller than what I bought. Probably should buy one size down. Fits nice, love the dress.


I liked the dress and the material is very nice.  The only problem is it's very fitting, I'm returning it.


Love it! Well made and I am going to buy 2 more as it is hard to find quality floral dresses! Recommend highly!


Order a size down. Material is very stretchy Without being tight or restrictive. I wish it was more snug in the calf area. Shipping was faster than expected. Overall I am happy. I will post a picture when I wear it and dress it up. i wouldn't pay $25 if I saw it in person.
