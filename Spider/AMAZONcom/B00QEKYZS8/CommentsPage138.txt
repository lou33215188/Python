The fit is true to size. This is a gorgeous dress! I bought it for the holidays. I love the way it fits and looks!


Adorable!!


I like the dress but runs small because it is slim fit. If you want comfortable then go up 2 sizes ( remember) once you wash it, shrinkage will occur and then it will fit perfect (spandex in the material.


Love this dress, super comfy and fit as expected according to the measurements.


I would give it 5 stars but the sleeves were weird, kinda big and not form fitting so i wore it with a blazer, looks perfect.


dress is great, I get A TON of compliments.
