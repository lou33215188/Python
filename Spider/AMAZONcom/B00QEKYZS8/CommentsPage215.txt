LOVE this dress!! I Definitely did't expect the fabric to be so thick! It's such great thick,stretchy fabric that doesn't stay stretched out! I wash it and then its back to the way i received it when i bought it.Buying a second one!


It is tight but not unflattering.


This dress definitely flatters me while I wear it and hides my stomach fat. Very comfortable and looks pretty on me


The pink small fits perfect but the white red small is way too small and medium is perfect (but still fits differently than the pink small). Weird but either way I love them both! I get lots of compliments and they're both very comfortable! They look great and hug in all the right places.


I haven't worn this yet, but loved it when I tried it on.  I can't wait for warmer weather.


I can't fit gave it to my daughter. material is good.


Very cute dress. Size as expected, colors are bright and fun. Very happy with this purchase.


LOVE Tom's Ware dresses. The material is a bit in a durable side which is perfect so it doesn't fade easily. This is fitted but does not hugged the body tight which is PERFECT!


It runs very small. I normally wear a medium or large and ordered the XL. It's fits..so I would order one size up. It also started piling after 1 wear. Wash it on gentle and hang to dry. Also you might have to take a razor to remove the piling. But for a dress under $20...its worth it.


I get so many compliments.  It fits the size.  I am 34dd, 5'3" and 119lbs.  Will buy in another color.
