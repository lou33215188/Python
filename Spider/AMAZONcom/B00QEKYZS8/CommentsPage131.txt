Love this dress!!!


Great dress for summer


Runs too big, get a size smaller. Fabric is nice and thick.


I liked the quality of the dress and it fit as expected. I'm 5'9" and 125 lbs, and ordered a small.


So beautiful! Fits perfectly! So happy with these dresses!


Usually im a size medium, i chose a size small/medium and the part of the arms were a lil loose. im doing some alterations. the dress is lovely even tho the fabric is not the value of the price. but i cant wait to wear it.. love the colors
