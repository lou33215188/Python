I loved this dress! Fits perfect, super comfortable. Exactly as described!


It was what I wanted!


What a great dress.


More than snug, super tight. Order larger size.


The dress fit great-  the cir was not blush pink... But more of coral. Luckily it looked great anyways!


I am 5'4 190lbs 34DD -36 waist - 44in hips/bum.  I wear a size 12 in pants and large in tops. I wear in 10 in most dresses or a large.  I ordered and US XL/XXL and it fit me too loose all over and even baggy in some (lower back &  waist).  So it seems true to size, I should have gotten a Large.
