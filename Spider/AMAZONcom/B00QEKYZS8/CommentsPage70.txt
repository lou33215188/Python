This is not a small.  It's xxxs!  :(


Cute colors and dress but way too small. I am 5'9 and 150 pounds, I bought a M. Returning.


This is a really nice dress, fits good, it's comfortable and hides my arms which I like.  The material is not too cheap either which was my main concern and I am a 1XL so I was impressed at how nice it looks on me.


Super cute dress.  I get complimented every time I wear it.  Only giving four stars due to sizing issue.  I am 5'3" 160lbs and the Large was suuuuper tight.  I ordered another dress in XL hoping for a more comfortable fit.


Just received my dress and omg I love it the material hugs me great and in all the right places..I am 5 10 yes a tall women it came to my knees like I wanted it to I love everything about it will be ordering more as of now.. Happy customer.. It goes great with the Jessica Simpson  erlene bootsğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


Nice dress


Love it! I'm 5'4" 120lbs. Usually get a small but chose to go up a size. Medium fit perfectly, a bit loose in the arms but more modest fit for work.


was ok could have been a little bit bigger


This dress is longer than I thought but it fit okay, color was nice.


Go by Asian measurements.  I am 5'1 and 117 pounds and this was way too small even though I ordered a medium.  I returned it.
