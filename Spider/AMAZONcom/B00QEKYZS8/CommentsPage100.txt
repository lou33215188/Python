I order a large. I am about 170 and I am 5,3. I'm curvy so You can see when I don't have undergarments under the dress. Fits how I wanted but if you don't want it tight should order up one size.


Gorgeous fits well and every curve. Material is not too thin or too thick. Stretchy fabric. Close to knee length and I'm five feet 7.


I love the length and the thickness of the material; the dress is both feminine and comfortable and the colors are bright and very pretty. I am 5'2" 110 lbs and the S size fits perfectly.


This dress is amazingly soft and comfy!


I'm 5'7 and curvy this fit me perfectly. Not too tight, uncomfortable or too loose. I'll be ordering more colors.


Love it! Fits as expected! I ordered a size M and I wear a size M :)

Love it!  It is a stretchy material but not too thin. Can't wait to get my jean jacket to wear over it. Get it you won't be disappointed! I added a belt I had
