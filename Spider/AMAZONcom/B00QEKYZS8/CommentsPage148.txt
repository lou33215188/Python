This dress is beau-ti-ful, i love it


Great dress for the price.


Casual yet elegant and it fits perfect a little below the knee. Will order in other prints!


OMD I love this dress it fits me lime i had it made just for me. Love it will be back for more.


Great material! Size was a bit big. I am 5'8 140lbs. I usually wear a medium so thats what I ordered. Suprisingly it was a little big. If you ate between sizes, get the smaller size.


Love all the colors on this dress and fits perfectly even over my pregnant belly :)


Fabric is thicker than I anticipated, great quality! It hugs your body perfectly, I'm so glad I purchased it! I weigh 130 and am 5'5 and I got a small/medium and it is perfect!


Great dress. Fast shipping. Fit great. Comfortable.


The color is nothing like on here. I thought i was getting a coral dress but I received a bright pink one. Still nice but I wanted coral. Fits great... I'm 5'9 142lbs and I ordered a M


Love it!


I'm 5'6" size 4-6 and a small was too tight. Will exchange for a medium. Sleeve and dress length fit as expected. Love the lightweight, stretchy fabric.
