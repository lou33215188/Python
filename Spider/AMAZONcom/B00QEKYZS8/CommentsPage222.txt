Far smaller than described. Fabric felt cheap, pattern looked cheap.


Ordered the dress in coral. It came in light pink! So I ordered it again and it still came in the light pink! Not only that but they won't return it because I opened the package to try it on. Ridiculous.


sizes run smaller.....dress is very pretty

Very comfortable to wear and very elegant with a belt


I ordered many of toms ware body on dresses and skirts. Pencil skirt are to big and the material are not good. This dress is too big. I order Xsmall, it can in xm/small and it's really big.  I have to return.. the other midi classic one are good..


Such a cute dress!  I am able to dress it up with heels and a blazer for work or wear it on the weekend running errands.  Comfortable, doesn't ride up.  I get many compliments on it!


Not shaped as pictured, dress cut has no shape and is extremely large, the medium is more like xtra large, this is more like plus size instead of regular size and worse off there is no way to contact the seller...
