Well made dress and fit as expected.


A very nice dress, I havent worn it yet but the material quality is great


Nice dress for the price


Most beautiful dresses I have ever owned. Skirts and gorgeous and I just bought 4 more recently


Lovely dress by Tom Ware.  Very form fitting, perfect for high heels.


Material is thick and stretchy. Love it. Just as pictured


I bought previously a navy color of this and I loved it. Then I got the pink, but I am not so happy. The dark color with the floral desn't show lines, what I though it was because of the thicker fabric. The pink does show panty lines. I am 5.7 and 110lb and the dress fits perfect.


I followed the size chart and still way too small. Unwearable.


Very pretty dress I love it!!


Nice quality material. I'm 5'7 162lbs, ordered a large and it fit well
