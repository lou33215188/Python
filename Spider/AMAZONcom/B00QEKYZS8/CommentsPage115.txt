CUTE ON


great dress..fabric was much better then i expected..fits great..i would buy dresses from tom's again


Good Product


Love this dress- it's a thick high quality material that doesn't wrinkle or shrink when washed. I love to wear it with leggings and a long cardigan.


I usually wear a large, so ordered a large and it was somewhat big tags said XL but dress said large.. love the dress though just didn't fit me snug enough so will b ordering this dress in a different size


the colors are very bright and the size was perfect!! I want to get some of the other colors now.


Nice pretty spring dress


It's pretty and hugs my figure but the sleeves are very large/baggy


Great dress! Love the colors and fit. I am 5'7", 150lbs and size large was perfect.
