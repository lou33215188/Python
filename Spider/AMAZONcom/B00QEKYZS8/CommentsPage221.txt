Beautiful and the material is thick so it hides any imperfections!!!


As suggested by other reviewers, I purchased a patterned print. I love the fit...but not the print. That said, I am purchasing a second dress (solid this time) and have no other complaints besides style!


I just got my dress and love it already. It’s super soft and stretchy. It’s form fitting, but since it’s strechy material, it’s not uncomfortable.


Absolutely beautiful dress, nice thick material. Very well made.


I got this dress in white floral in a size XXL just to be sure it would fit properly, and it fits really well! I could have gone down a size, but it definitely is true to size. The material is slightly thicker and sturdier than T-shirt material, while still be super comfy like a tee. Would definitely buy in more colors, totally cute.


This dress was beautiful!!!  I loved how it felt, and loved the style---but it was just too clingy for me-hence the 1 star.


Loved the dress and quality. It is a bit tight. I used the size chart but it seems to run a bit smaller then indicated.  So consider then when purchasing.


This dress runs very small. I normally wear a medium, I ordered a large and it was way too small. Too bad, because otherwise I really liked the dress.


Dress was stained from the black tag ! I can't even consign it! I don't do returns .. No time or printer ..


Not bad, nice dress. Runs small.
