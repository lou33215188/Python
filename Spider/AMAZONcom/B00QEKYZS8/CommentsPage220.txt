Poor quality  - returned


Cute dress, it is form fitting so if you are bigger go for darker and more patterns


Wife liked this for Valentine's Day!


Amazing. When bough on lightning deal was $10 (I bought 2).  The fabric is high quality and the print very feminine. It falls below the knees. Very classy.


This has been one of my favorite dresses throughout my pregnancy. It is not a maternity dress, but has grown with me perfectly through the full 9 months! I sized up to a Large, I'm 5'5" 125 pre-preg weight and am 174lbs now at 36 weeks preg.


Love the length and how low the sleeves are. Buying more in different colors!


Pretty dress.  Much better quality than expected.  I went a size down based on some of the reviews but had to return because it appears to run true to size after all.  I would purchase again.


This was my first dress order off Amazon and I actually loved it. I was worried it would be cheap see through fabric. To my surprise it was actually thick quality fabric. It fit perfectly, I would definitely buy another soon.


The dress is so comfy, fabric is thicker than expected and so soft.  Love, love it.
