In 5'3  weight 133  I always wear a medium and had to return the dress, then reordered an xl and it was still to small...


It looked nothing like the picture. The color was not the same more soâ€‹ a white background and the flowers were different. it looks like something a senior citizen would wear at home to lounge around.


Fits great and is made of thicker material so it's not see through


Love ! Everything about it is 5stars and its longer than what I expected which is a plus cause most dresses make me feel like my butt is going to fly out or something . 3rd dress getting and wish the other colors had my size.


Got here right on time (I needed it the afternoon it arrived)! Looks exactly like the photo, fit perfectly, and it was comfortable. I can't wait to buy more, once I have my baby :)


One of my less expensive dresses and my all time favorite. Definitely more that what you pay for.


Nice dress.


Buy a size or two bigger, I am 5'8" 130lbs and I usually wear a S/M but I ordered a Large. Fits perfectly. I also ordered a Tomsware in Medium before and it was restrictive


Incredibly flattering. I am very curvy and it hugs my curves without being skin tight or uncomfortable. Hits right Above my knees too so it shows leg without overdoing it


This dress is adorable! I plan on buying more in different prints/colors. High quality fabric also, very comfortable.
