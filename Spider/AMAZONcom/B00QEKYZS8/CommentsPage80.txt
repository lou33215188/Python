Dress was well made but it fit kind of weird.  Fit my bust ok, I am a 36B, but too wide with extra material on my hips.  Liked the colors and material of the dress but it was not right for me, if you have a bigger booty than me it might be just the thing. Returned.


I got an extra large in this dress and it's snug and I'm a size 12. I like it, but I feel it runs a bit small. That's why I'm only giving it three stars.


Great fit, vibrant color, fabric is good quality and doesn't feel cheap or thin. Got lots of compliments on this one!


It was ok.  I thought it would be more fitted and that I could dress it up sexy.  I'll likely be wearing it to work so not a total waste.


Pretty pattern. Nice material. Too loose in the top and way too tight in the tummy...not flattering at all. I normally wear a medium or large dress size. I ordered this dress in an XL to be on the safe side due to the reviews.  It still did not fit well at all. Bummed as the pattern is super cute.


You can literally see every single bump and limp you have in this dress. I wanted to love it but have never worn it in months.


It looks great on. It's comfortable, good material. I have two and I ordered one more


This dress is super comfy. I don't really like the print, however it makes a great dress to hang out at home. I will order more of these dresses, just not in the print. The fabric is a nice weight knit and it fits perfect. I have to admit they are very comfortable and easy to wear and I am excited to order several more in plain colors. Great dress for the price.


I love this. It hugs in all the right places and is good quality


LOVE this dress.  I'm 5'3.5 and 170lbs and it fit perfectly, got the medium/large.
