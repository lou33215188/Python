You get what you pay for. Great fit. Dress it up dress-down.


It was a little bit tighter than I expected but it isn't a big deal. Really great material and it looks great.


Very cute and hugs just right .It was perfect for an outdoor wedding I went to.


TOO Snug. And I'm no longer a fan of the color.


It's nice but a bit long


This dress is beautiful !


Fits perfectly. Many compliments


Was given as a gift.  She loved it so much....5 stars to seller...ty


Very well made. Love it!


Its more of a night shirt type material but it works wonderfully as a cute casual summer dress.
