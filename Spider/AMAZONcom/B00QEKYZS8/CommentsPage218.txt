I bought this when it was on lightening deal for $11. For a cheap dress it’s amazing! But as you can imagine it’s tight— so only purchase if you’re comfortable in your own skin.


I love these. There very form fitting and comfy


I loved the style and the dresses .( I ordered 2 ) but they certainly were not XXL which , according to the size chart , would fit me . WAY to small !! Very disappointed .  :(


Nice dress however size runs a little small.


love it.


Love the pattern and fits great


Great material, long enough for work, and fancy enough for a special event. It would be a perfect maternity dress as it is not tight around the stomach. Only complaint is that the arm holes in a medium are a little too big for me (5'7" 125 lbs).


Fits true to size, does hug the body, i wear an xlarge if i was any bigger i couldn't wear because it is a body con type of dress


I'm 5'4" and 120lbs, and the small wears like it was tailor made for me. The fabric seems quality, not too thin, good stretch. Seriously considering buying in multiple patterns.


Great dress, fits my curves
