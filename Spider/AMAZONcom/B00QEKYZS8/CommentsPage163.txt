A little long for me 5'5- however good value!


This is a beautiful dress that is true to size. I was hesitant first because of the pattern but it turned out to be beautiful and very flattering, Fabric is nice and soft. Love it!!


I ordered the teal & the color of the dress is amazing perfect for spring and it's thick fabric so no lines show I love it! Good quality dress


Super cute! Order up a size

Cute dress. It definitely needs better tailoring.
