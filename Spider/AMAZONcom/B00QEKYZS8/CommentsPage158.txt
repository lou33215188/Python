Ordered bigger size and still too small. Going to return


True to size. I got a large but I have hips and thighs so maybe a xlarge would of been better only because its snug but it's nice either way.


amazing dress for the money!! well made and adorable!


I got XL and its kinda of small


Ordered a size up. It fit. Really nice fabric weight. Looks good on.


Soooo cute! Material is very nice!


Style


I bought this dress in black and I love it! Very cute paired with a clutch and heels... I'm 5ft6 and the hem catches me just under the knee.M/L is a actually a L, so the fit is a little big for me (I'm a U.S. Size 8)


Really cute dress!! Ordered a size M...I am 5' 5" and 140lbs. Fits perfect! LOVE IT!!


Material is good quality fits as expected  I ordered  medium it fits well. I love the length  it's at the knee. I'm 5ft 7 inches 137 lb. It fits great.
