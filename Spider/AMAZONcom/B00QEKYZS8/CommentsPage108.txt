Sizing off, fabric Ok runs small


This dress is definitely something I would recommend.


I turned quite a few heads wearing this and it fits perfectly on me.


I am definitely buying another in a different style. <3


great dress- reviews were helpful in picking out a color!


I ordered this dress per the size chart and it fit in the hips but was too big in the waist and shoulders. I usually wear a size 14 and bought the XL. The dress does have a super cute pattern though-I'm going to try to alter it.


I absolutely love this seller! This is my second time purchasing from them. Both orders I ordered dresses. The material of both dresses were perfect! Not cheap looking at all! I received nothing but compliments! I highly recommend this seller.


Great fit! I am 5'2 & 190lbs I got a size L/XL. I love the way it looks. Only thing is since i'm short the dress longer but it's fine i still love it!


Looks beautiful on! I love it! I'm 5'4 and it's just at knee , slightly above, so not short and not hoochie looking lol! Will be wearing to my daughter's graduation from police academy so want to be semi conservative.


My new favorite. Ordered a medium I am 5'7 145 I love it


Good quality material. Washes well (cold wash/hang dry). Looks classy!


I recommend this dress. I am 5ft 1/128lbs and ordered an XS. It fits snug.


Its a thick material and longest than I thought which isn't bad! II have no complaints.
