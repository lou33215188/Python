Thicker quality material and thus a little warm. Fits long to mid shin (I am 5'4''). I really like it.


Love this dress! Beautiful, fit just right, nice material, hugs nicely in all the right places! Def a keeper!


I'm 5'8" & 200lbs (just had a baby 4 weeks ago) and I ordered an XL. Perfect!


I absolutely love this dress so much that I ordered 2 more in different colors.


I love the dress,but wish I ordered a size smaller.It runs big,and I'm a thick chick.Wide hips and a big behind and the 2xl swolled my shape.I'm returning it.


I'm a size 10-12, 5'5.5", rather curvy, & with a 36 DDD chest, I ordered a large, quite big on me. Great length though, kind of midi length on me, which I love. Hopefully since it seems to be cotton with a bit of spandex for stretch, it'll shrink a tad.


I am about 173lbs and I orederd a large and the dress fits perfectly...I was a bit concerned when I saw that the us tag says medium and the Asia says large...but when I tried it on I had no issues...can't wait to wear this dress for my birthday in two weeks time....I would highly recommend this dress


Transparent though.


Beautiful dress, beautiful fit. Fits true to size.


I found this manufacturer on a web page that stated this dress can be compared to LLR's Julia. I have quite a a few Julia's so I decided to give this dress a shot. This dress is actually software and a little thicker than the Julia. I didn't need to wear a slip under this. It does run a little small, but other than that I really like this dress. I wear a size 10 and ordered a large. It fits, but I didn't want the "glove" fit and that is how it fits.  It comes in fun prints and is super cute.


What a GREAT dress! It fits snug, hugs in all the right places, the fabric is thick but breathable. Oh, no pantylines either! I want one in every color!
