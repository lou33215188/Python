I wear a medium it fit  loose around the middle. Otherwise I love it's vibrant colors perfect for Spring and Summer!


Perfect dress... If u are a medium u should get the S-M not LM


I bought this dress for my wife and I got no complaints from her and I loved how she looked in it!  Although I don't like the looks she got from other men.  I may have set myself up for failure...


Gorgeous floral pattern and perfect fit. I like my dresses right above the knee and this one is perfect.


Fits perfectly and looks great.  Hides imperfections. I received so many compliments


IT WAS A LITTLE TOO SNUG. A MEDIUM SHOULD HAVE FIT ME. I AM 5'8' AND WEIGH 125#. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LARGE.


****I reordered one in a medium and it is a perfect fit. I a very happy and would recommend this seller's merchandise easily. The quality is definitely there. Just know your sizing, ladies!


Pattern dresses fit more snug. Order one size up.


Love this dress! I have larger hips than usual so clothes can be a bit tricky. But this dress hugs in all the right places, and it's not too short, either. I wore it out once and received a lot of compliments!


Love this dress going to buy more. Fits like a glove. My husband told me I looked beautiful in it.


Love this dress!!! I have ordered 6 of these dresses I love the fit so much â˜º.  The one thing I like the most is the length, it sits just below the knee.  It keeps it shape very, very well even after a dozen uses!
