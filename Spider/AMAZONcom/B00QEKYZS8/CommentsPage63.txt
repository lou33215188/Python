I am a 36 DD & a size 14 jeans;i bought an XL this fit perfectly & looked amazing !  I wore it for Easter. I recieved loads of compliments everyone wanted to know where i got it. It is very well made & thick. Not the least bit see through but i always wear a slip. I bought another in black.


I ordered per the size chart.  I received it yesterday and it fits amazing!!!  It is polyester so it isn't tight if you use the size chart.  I love this dress and can't wait to wear it!!!!


Love the fit and style!


Love this dress! I have a difficult time finding dresses with sleeves that also go to the knee. I'm 5'7, 160lbs, and 16 weeks pregnant so I ordered a large. Fit nice and snug without being too tight. It's a forgiving fabric for my growing belly with a nice modest neckline. Fabric is light enough for moderate temperatures but not see through. Hem hits me mid kneecap. Perfect!

This dress is super cute, but I ordered a larger size than I probably needed based on other reviews, but I should've stuck with my original size. I'm going to get it tailored and it should work just fine.


The dress is very pretty. It looks just as it does in the pictures. It does cling to the body very tightly so if you are large or curvy order a size up.


Got so many compliments on this dress, it was a bit tight but no one seemed to care


Really cute, very comfortable wear-to-work dress. Fabric is a nice weight without being too thick.


The pattern on the floral dress is great. Itâ€™s a bit short and is still a little snug even after sizing up. Still, worth the money. I wear spanx and Iâ€™m good to go.
