Absolutely stunning, fits perfectly, great thick material, beautiful colors! Very impressed!


See through...cant really wear it.  Disappointed. Not sure how anyone else's underwear isn't showing through their white dress in the photos


It did meet my expation.itshould have been a large


Was better than I imagined. I wore it too a wedding and had tons of compliments!


super cute and flattering


Cute but if you big chested go up a size


I ordered s/m & a medium came. It's a good fit. Material is a nicer quality, not super thin. I love the pattern & color.


Super cute dress, very comfortable.


Wished I wouldâ€™ve got him a size larger


Fits well. I'm 5ft and around 190 so I got a xl and it fits great!
