I bought this simple dress for work and I love it. not too revealing. Length of the dress is appropriate for work. I received many compliments on this dress.


Adorable dress want another color


I love this dress! I'm 5'2", 140lbs, 32DD, and always wear a body shaper; the medium fit me great. I recommend a belt to break it up a bit. The material is nice and not thin or cheap feeling at all. The dress went to my knees, so if you've got height on you, it might be shorter.


Great fit and love the quality fabric, just ordered another dress!


It looked great when I finally got it on.  However, it was nearly impossible to take off! I felt like a snake slithering out of my skin.  So, I returned it.


Pretty dress, but a bit tight. The material looks like it may shrink after it's washed. Really pretty though.


I just love it !!!! Itâ€™s just perfect


Great material, but way too large. I'm 5'7  and I weight 130 Pound's, I ordered a medium but this was way to large around shoulder area. Not good.
