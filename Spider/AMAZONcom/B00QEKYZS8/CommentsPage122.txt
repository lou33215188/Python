I really enjoy wearing this colored floral print. It adds just the right pizazz.


Beautiful dress I love the material.


Quality material.  Hugs my body the right way complementing my curves.  I am 5'7" and 175 lbs.  I ordered a large.


Surprisingly this dress was thicker material than expected and I got so many compliments on it!  I'm 5.5 mths pregnant and wore it to my shower!


Love the colour. I bought the us L/ Xl and i am about 205 in weight and it fit exact just how I wanted it to. I would suggest if you want a little less loose fitting take one size up


Great dress for spring. Awesome fit. This is my 2nd dress from Tom's Ware. They are both beautiful.


Was surprise with the quality of the material.


Love the dress! True to size. I'm 5'1, 125 lbs, got small and it fit perfectly.


i have worn and washed this dress three time, the color is still as bright and vibrant as the day i got it.


Fits really well and nicely made.
