I ordered an XS and it was still very large, almost a Medium. It was also extremely long so I did have it alerted. I would suggest company makes XXS as well for insurance. However I will say that the dress itself was very nice and the fabric and appearance was true to the picture.


Love the fit


But such tacky color flowers


Bought in beige and the flowers look neon


The fit is great. I bought L for my body 6ft tall and about 180lbs. Big booty.


I bought 2 dresses the purple flowers which fits tight on the body. And pink is also L but is a little not tight and loser on the neck line. Pictures attached...the pink runs large on me and its not as tight fit as the white with purple flowers .pictures attached


This dress was everything!!!! I got compliment after compliment on it. Fits like a glove. I'm 5'2; 185 lbs, Size 12 and I ordered the L/XL in teal/floral -- I have booty and large breasts. The material is very sturdy and not cheap feeling at all, but also not hot. Good stretch without feeling like it is going to tear. And the color is absolutely beautiful!


Dress fit as expected and is true to size , I am 5'5 , 156 pounds with a slight bulging gut, but the material is thick and hides it very well. I will purchase this dress again in different colors. I purchased size Large, if you have an hour glass shape this dress will hug you in all the right places if you buy a size that is true to your size.
