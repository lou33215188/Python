The fitting of these Tom dresses are so good I keep buying them in different prints.


Nice dress


This dress is great!  Fits as great.  The material is good quality, so even though its a tight fit, you don't need to worry about it being see through.


Great fit. Nice colors.


Wow!!!! Beautiful!!!!! Looks much better then expected !


Very nice dress. I am 200 pounds and ordered the XXL it fits so well.I got many compliments at work. I recommend buying.


I got like 30 compliments on this dress the first day I wore it. The boyfriend likes it, guess it's a keeper.


Medium size is just right for me. Not too tight and not too lose. It kinda hid my bulging cesarean tummy. I'm 5'4, 33-28-35. I will definitely buy another one!


My husband loves when i wear this, he says it make sme look like a model, lol
