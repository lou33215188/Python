I'm not sure about this dress!! It fits me fine but the sleeves area is a bit big.  You have to be slim with big arms to fill this dress well.  Keeping it though.


I love this dress!!!! It is asian sized so an xxl is really an xl so its abit snug, but a great product all around!!! warning the color on the computer is much brighter than the one in real life, that works for me cuz im not much of a fan of vibrant colors, but if u are remember its a bit faded.


It's cute but show every flaw. Annnd I'm 5'10" and it feels pretty short.


Sizing of the dress is perfect to their size chart.  Unlike other online retailers who have quality and size issues,  this is NOT one of them.  I will for sure order from them again!


I love this dress. It's really comfortable and for a perfect.


Very surprised as to the quality of the dress. Nice thick material. I am 5'9 and 180 lbs. and ordered an XL. It fits a little loose in the arms, but  conforms my rear very well. Length comes down right above my knees. Possibly a work outfit. Looks great with my Shiney red heels!!!


Very stretchy. Great material. Fabric is not cheap/see-through


Best purchase, buy it now!


Beautiful i love it fit as expected


Great material and pattern, but it is a little long for my height and liking. I'm 5'6 and petite
