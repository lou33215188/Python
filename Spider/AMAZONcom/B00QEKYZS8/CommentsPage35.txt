Ridiculously small...5 sizes off


I bought and returned another black midi dress.  This one was exactly what I was looking for. I am 5'9" usually wear a 10/12 and bought an XL.  Fit well and not too tight.


I will be getting more dresses. It fits like a glove and shows all your curves. Iâ€™m 5ft 2 and weigh 118. I bought the small. I feel beautiful in this.


If you are on the fence about ordering this dress, order it! I have odd measurements/proportions and this is very flattering. Both the length and fit are wonderful! Super comfortable and all around awesome!


I bought this outfit for my sweetheart and she looked soo dammm good in it we almost did not go out again. this dress really ehanced all the best features of her sexxy body. i would give you 10 stars but 5 is the max you cna get.


This dress is comfortable and light weight. The pattern is gorgeous and I was even asked if I was wearing another pricier brand. The length of the sleeves for the arms is great for anyone who is self conscious about their arms too.


I really like this dress.  It is a great prince and a cute dress.  The color in the picture makes it look blue but it came and is actually green.  I wish it were the color in the picture, but the green is really cute.  The dress comes to my knees and I am 5'9 so it's a great length.  Fits as expected.


Got a size medium. I'm 5.5 1/2 135 pounds.  Bust 36D waist 28" hips 39"Form fitting shows off the curves. stretchy material. It falls right below the knee. Great buy ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾


Fits beautifully,  arrived ahead of the expected date. Colors are just as vibrant as the picture. I feel very good in this dress and I may order another in a different color.
