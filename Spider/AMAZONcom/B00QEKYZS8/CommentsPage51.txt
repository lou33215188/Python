I thought the dress was cute but the sleeves were too tight and the scoop was too deep. So I emailed them and they had me return it and gave me a full refund.


Love it ! I read the comments  so I ordered it bigger than my size. Because the commments said it ran smaller and I should have gone with a large not a 2 X. Still keeping it just getting it altered.  I even ordered another one. Quality is great !


This is the most comfortable dress I've ever worn! Fabric feels like a light sweatshirt and breathable .  I've gotten so many compliments on this dress. This was one of my favorite buys on Amazon. I wore this for a baptism. You can dress this up or down


Wonderful! A little surprised it was like cotton jersey (not shiny at all or like spandex/poly), it's very good quality. It does show your stomach if you have flab, so I'll wear it with spanx. I'm 5'7" 140ish lb, got the M/L and it's great, with lots of stretch to spare. It hits around my knees.


Beautiful dress.  Great material -- Not see through.  Only gave a 4 because it was too small ordered a Large which is my size but it runs really small.  Have to reorder as a 2x or even 3x if you do not like fitted clothes.  Otherwise great for the price


This dress is so cute! The only thing I don't like is that the one I bought appeared black in the picture, but when it arrived it was dark blue, but it's still a good dress.


First dress bought from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised. Very soft and stretchy. Looked great on. A cheaper material than expected, but should've realized because of the price.


Waaaayyyyy too small and I wear a size 2p!  Don't waste your time.


I'm stunned by all of the positive reviews on this dress..the material is thick and uncomfortable and the colors..hurt the eyes.


Nice dress for church or just out. 5"6 170  I got a large fits perfect and right to the knee.
