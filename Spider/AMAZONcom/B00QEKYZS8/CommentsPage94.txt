Sizing too small and dress does not look as good in person as it does in the picture. All I can say is that the packaging was good.


I love this dress in me, can't wait to buy more of them!


I love there dresses but sometimes I don't know what size to purchase because at times the XL can be too small or the XXL is way too big. Other than that I have no problems with my items and will continue to order from Tom's.


Love them!!! They both ( [L] solid black & navy blue floral print) fit like a glove, it accentuates my curves extremely well!!!


Great fabric! Pretty floral print. I got the dark navy blue. Fabric is snug and medium thick, great quality. I ordered the small/medium. For reference I'm 5'4, 130 lbs, 32C, and am usually a size 6/8 and medium.


5'5 135 pounds got a medium and it fits well.  This dress is beautiful.


I purchased the xs/s, received small. Fit almost perfectly. The sleeves are a bit too big and it's a little too long (passed my knees), but I'm 5'2. For reference my measurements are 34B-27(1/2)- 38 and I'm 119Lbs. This dress can be dressed up and dressed down and I can't wait to wear it out.


Sexy sexy sexy. One of my favorite dresses and it can be dressed up with heels or down with sandals.


I used the size guide to determine my appropriate size and it turned out to be too big. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and gave the dress to a friend. The material was of good quality and if it wasn't too big for me I would have kept it.


Fits perfectly
