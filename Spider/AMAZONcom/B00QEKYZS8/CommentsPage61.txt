I had to order one size bigger than I normally wear, but it fit great! I ordered the navy/orange and grey. Love them both! So cute!


I love this dress and have bought several in different colors. I they they run small, but that also depends on how you like them to fit. I don't like mine extremely tight so I order 1 size up. They are great quality and look really nice. Very stylish and I always get a lot of compliments on them.


The dress was extremely small, I ordered an XL and I couldn't even get it on.


Loved this dress. Saw it in other pictures and knew it would be perfect for my maternity photos. I got a size large and I couldn't have been happier.


Love this dress! I bought 4 different floral ones. I was a little nervous to buy that many but it was so hard to narrow it down. I'm 5"7 , 130 lbs. 32a.  I bought the small/ med . It fit great. The fabric is thick enough not to need a slip and  it goes to my knee. High quality. I love all the dresses. It's comfortable enough to wear casual or dressy enough to wear out anywhere.


Great dress. Looks great on.


The material is thicker than I expected. A mix of cotton and spandex. Mostly spandex. I just didn't want something so thick and tight.  But the fit was good and the dress is flattering.


Cute dress but sizing is way small. I'm a 6-8 in AE and the size Medium hugged me like Saran Wrap. I'm reordering in a large to see how that fits. Medium is being returned as it's way too small.


I am 5'6, 175lbs, hourglass figure, 38C,and the L/XL fits pretty snug. Doesn't show any bumps and it all looks smooth. I could have probably gone one size up, but I was afraid it was going to be big and look frumpy. I think it is going to stretch a bit anyways. Overall, super cute for casual/beach or with blazer to dress it up.
