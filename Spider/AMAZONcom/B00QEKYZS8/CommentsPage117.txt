Very happy with this purchase besides that it does run small. I had a feeling to go a size up & I am SO glad I did. Other than that, it is absolutely DARLING!!!


Love the dress fits perfect and very comfortable


Can’t wait to wear it for spring/summer happenings! Fits great and I’m on my 3rd baby, 25 weeks. I ordered a large.


Love the fit of this dress! I am 5'3 120 and with curves and I bought a medium! Thicker fabric hides any imperfections! I will be buying more!


Loved the dress! Perfect fit ! Will buy another color soon !


Fit perfect..true to size,beautiful


Love this dress. The material is thicker than you expect and looks well made.


Looks great! I love the color and pattern. Material is nice too. Not cheap looking


I LOVE this dress! Soft material, snug fit that hugs every curve in just the right way, and very flattering! What more could you ask for in a dress? Plan on ordering another in a different color!


Cute but not for anyone with anything but a completely flat stomach! Also says navy but I held up to my black shirt and it's the same! Disappointed bc I needed navy
