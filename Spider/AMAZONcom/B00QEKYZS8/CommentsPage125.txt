I was a bit skeptical about this dress but i love it. The material is a bit different than what I expected as it has a but more spandex to it but it is truly lovely. The length is perfect and it is very comfortable. Shipping was fast.


This is a great dress. Sturdy material and doesn't shrink.


Im 5'10" and about 175 lbs. I wear a size 14. I ordered the extra large and it was skin tight. I got the off white dress with red and green flowers and it was see through.  Returning.  Overall, it just didn't work for me at all.


Great material, great design, so cute! But I'm 134lb and a 34C and the neckline was too wide, and the dress fit too tight.


Love this dress


Its beautiful dress and good quality I return because I order L so I will bought a XL to fit better.


Love love love this dress! I got a M & fit perfectly! I'm 135lbs & 5'5 SUPER CUTE!


Looks and feels likes it costs more than it does. A good investment for my rockabillys out there. The colors are very vibrant and looks very classy.


This dress has gotten so many compliments. The fabric is pretty thick, so it doesn't show a lot of lines. The cut is long enough to wear to work, or a nice event. Great quality for the price.  I've worn and washed a couple times now, and it still looks brand new.


The dress is a lot thicker in material than I expected, but is a good dress to have in your closet
