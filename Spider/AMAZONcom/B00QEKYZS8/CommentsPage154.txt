Nice quality


Loved it


The dress did not represent the sizes shown.


super large! nice for the price


OMG I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS. It came right on time, and it fits me perfectly. Very well made. I'm 5"5 and 135 lbs, 36 DD and the size S/M fits me perfectly.


Perfect. Buy it


Love this item....nice material and color.


great fit. flattering on a curvy frame. material is thick enough for body con while still maintaining the dress's shape. would certainly buy more of this brand


This dress is a great length and is soft and breathable.


I love it !!
