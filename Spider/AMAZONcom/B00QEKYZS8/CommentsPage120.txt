Perfect length and quarter sleeves look lovely. Very happyğŸ™‚


Got a medium and its a little snug.  The material is wonderful and its really pretty floral pattern.


I absolutely love this dress. Normally I wear a large but I decided to order a size up and it was a great ideas.  If your are looking for a perfect fit wear your regular size. If your are looking for something with a little more room order a size up.


Very cute!! Fits well and can be dressed up or down. Will sure buy more if they come with other solid colors!


This dress is absolutely beautiful. I am 5'7, 200lbs no gut but a lot of butt. I didn't want a dress to fit too too tight and this is the one. It hugs you in the right places it feels good against my skin. I will definitely be ordering more next week. Shipping was lighting fast too.


Loveeeee It!!!!!!


Listen these dresses are absolutely everything the reviews stated. The quality of the material is so soft and strong.  The stitching is excellent.  The colours are vibrant and true to image.  I am normally an XL 14-16, I ordered 2XL.  I am very busty, however, the top was a bit full, so if you have a small top and larger bottom you must be aware, I was ordering for the large bosom, but the bottom is fine. it flows very well.  These dresses can dress up or down.  I bought 4 one time based on the reviews and the price.  I love my purchases, Tom's Ware will hear from me again !!!


These dress fits just right and hugs everything I want it to... '''love love love this dress and will be ordering the other colors


True to size and I am a small. The material is way too thin, but I will wear with a sweater or blazer to cover up so to speak. Plain black dress can not go wrong except for the thin material.
