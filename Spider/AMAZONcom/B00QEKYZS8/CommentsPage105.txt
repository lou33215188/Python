I usually wear a medium but after reading the reviews I ordered a large and the large seemed a little tight


Fits perfectly. Looks good on me.


love it


I hesitate to give fewer than 4 stars because the dress seemed to be well-made, even though I can't speak to the quality of the fit. In the black color, the fabric was thick and reasonably stretchy, while providing some structure as well. Unfortunately, I am 5'9 and 120lb (usually wear XS or size 0-2) but even the X-small/Small was massive on me. I have a particularly slim upper body, so the shoulders and waist were very floppy and I had to return it.


I have this dress in so many colors. My favorites so far are the grey and black.


Great fit - just wish it was a little shorter, since I'm petite. Awesome dress!


cute runs a little small


Loved this dress! Fit perfectly and got lots of compliments. It showed off my figure without being too tight or too short.  I also loved that it had a little sleeve so it can be worn more places.


Love this!  It is beautifully form fitting!  The material is very soft and of quality so you can't see through it!  All around great item to add to my wardrobe


I love the dresses they fit better than expected. I got two xlarge/ xxlarge and 1 large/xlarge the xlarge/xxlarge fit loose but still show curves and the large/xlarge fit perfect for me. I usually wear a 14-16 in pants 44dd 230 so I hope this helps.
