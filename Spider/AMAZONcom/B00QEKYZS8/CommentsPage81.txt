Really good quality. Material is comfy and stretchy. Dress length is perfect, below the knee. Hugs curves perfectly. Will be purchasing more from the seller in the future. Very happy!


lop-sided in the hip area and the arms were sewn incorrectly(backwards). Also the material is cheap (cracks) and customer service was incompetent and possibly in India.


LOVE IT


I love this dress and got lots of compliments. I did sew in the sleeves a little because the dress was so fitting it was weird the arms were loose.


Absolutely love love love this dress!! Bought it to wear for my 20th birthday (july 16th) which is obviously tomorrow but i did try it on and i loooove the material and i love how it hugs my  curves but its not too tight to show my rolls teehe! Will buy other dresses from this distributer!


This dress goes down to my knees and I love it for casual outings. Its super comfy, but the neckline is just a little bit wider than I expected.


Beautiful print and good, thick fabric. Kind of holds you in in certain places.  Very comfortable.


Love it!


Great dress for the price
