Fabric is decently soft - not plasticy spandex like other fitted dresses I've purchased. I'm 5'3" and a curvy 125lbs, I ordered a medium and it fit perfect. Very comfortable. Great deal.


I love this dress! I get so many compliments. It is very comfortable and feels like quality material. I will definitely be buying again!


I love it! It's ecxacly what I wan. Nice price too


I actually had about 6 compliments on this dress yesterday - one lady yelled from across the parking lot. It fits like a glove and I love it.


My husband bought this for me and I hadn't realized you can see thru the dress. This  dress should have a liner attached underneath.  Otherwise it was very comfortable and fit nicely.


Love love love! Such great quality and great price point, I'm really impressed. Ordered a small -- typically I'm a size 2. I'm 5'6".


Bought this one for my daughter and a different size for me, and bought each of them a size up for a little extra room.  They run very small.  Disappointed.


Beautiful print..looks great on. I would purchase one size bigger if I was ordering again. It fits a little snugger than I expected. Nice material and stitching.


This dress is awesome! The material is thicker so it hides imperfections. It is super soft! I usually wear a medium or sometimes large dress if it fits tight or a bit small... I ordered a large and it fit perfectly ! I am 5'8" and 165lbs athletic build. Would definitely order again!


This is a beautiful dress. Loved the fit. It had a small spot in the front. That was all you saw. I ordered it on Prime day and would re order it but its now more.
