I love this dress!! Its definitely a must have for nights out and date nights, its stunningly beautiful! Got lots of compliments when I wore it. I'm happy with my purchase!


was a bit large in the back


It's gorgeous ^_^


I LOVE this dress! Amazing quality, perfect fit! Was perfect for Easter!


I was sad that is dress was too small.  It is a great pattern and fabric thickness, it just was too tight to look good on me.


Fabric is lil thick and best to hold , runs small so returned and ordeing again


Size and design..


i just buy for my freind


I can see this working for some body types, but on me it wasn't flattering. I'll also note that the white color is kind of see through, so watch out for that.


I absolutely love the dress...could be more to the actual size...does run a little small. Great material, not made with cheap material. I'm just a little worried that it may shrink even more when I wash it since it already runs a little small.
