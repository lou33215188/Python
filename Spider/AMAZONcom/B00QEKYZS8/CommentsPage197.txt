I love this dress, its form fitting but its great with a shaper. I bought a cpl ğŸ˜³ğŸ˜�


This dress arrived promptly and was wonderfully packaged! It fits as expected and the colors are SO pretty! It's a one of a kind dress that I have got so many compliments on. Length goes to the knees and sleeves are the perfect length. I love my navy dress!!


Very WARM Fits perfect. I'm 5'10", 38-28-42, You can dress it up or down. I bought a Large


Use a statement necklace around the collar. Dress it up with a belt or a cashmere wrap sweater.


This is my first Toms Wear purchase. The dress is a nice fabric with a bit of stretch. Not clingy. I normally wear a size Medium/8. I ordered the medium and it fits perfectly. Dress it up or down.


Love love love love love this dress!


Loved the dress, fits perfect. Im 5'2" 180lbs, I got the xl.  Wish they had more design choices don't love the design


My hubby loves me in this dress. My only issue is if you have big breast it is very snug at the top. Colors pop and hugs every curve.


I ordered a Black and a Navy of this dress and they arrived fairly quickly.  At first glance, I thought they sent me 2 Black ones, but under sunlight, I realized they did send a Black and a Navy (in plastic bags, they looked almost identically black).  The colors and look of these dresses are terrific.  HOWEVER (a big HOWEVER), I ordered an XL but the dresses fit more like a tight-fitting MEDIUM.  If your bust is 40" or over, you will feel like a stuffed sausage in the XL.  I have returned the dresses and the return process is easy as pie and you don't have to pay for return postage.  You simply follow the return process, print the return labels, stick them where instructed, and drop the package off in a UPS drop box or go to a UPS customer service center and they'll even print a receipt there for you.  If this dress ever comes in a genuine American Size 12 or 14 without having to stretch the fabric, I would definitely order it again.


great quality
