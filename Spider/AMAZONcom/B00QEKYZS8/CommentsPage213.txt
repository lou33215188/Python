There was no stretch in this dress.  It didn't fit as expected.  It was not forgiving at all.  I love the print.


I bought the whitered, navy, and green dresses and they are all really cute! I'm 5'4 and 105 lbs so I bought the small. Overall, they fit as expected; however the navy dress was a tad big in the shoulder and bust area but not so much that it looks bad or that I would need to return to it.  These will be perfect for the spring and summer with flip flops or wedges.


This dress is gorgeous. I'm 5'9" 185 and I got an xl. It fits perfect. It has a little stretch to it and hugs all your curves.


Its a cute dress however it is skin tight so I am working up the "courage" to wear it.


I got a size medium and it fits just like it should. This is not meant to be a flowy dress so it should be expected that it will be a bit tighter, but its not uncomfortably tight by any means. I got the classic black with colored flowers and it always gets compliments at work, a very office friendly dress!


So stretchy so please stick to your size.it hugs my curves am so sexy in them


I'm returning this... the top is meant for a line backer.  The bottom fit me perfect but the top was huge.  Even if I was well endowed It would not work. The shoulders were so wide apart.


I didn't really like the material of this dress.  It looks and feels like a really big t-shirt.  Definitely not what I expected.


Beautiful dress, good workmanship, decent fabric, but it was simply too small for me.  I usually wear a 14/16 in dresses and the XL was too snug.  Had to return it.


Waaaay to tight.. you may want to order a size up. I’m going to give this to one of my skinner nieces.. it’s really cute.
