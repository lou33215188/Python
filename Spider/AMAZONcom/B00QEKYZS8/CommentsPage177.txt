Great quality and fit. Material was not see thru or cheap.


Love it, I have already ordered more in different colors.


Looks exactly like the pic, but I guess I expected it to be tighter and for it to be shorter (it's below the knees).


Awesome. Bought this for my baby shower and it accommodated my 7 month bump perfectly.  Good quality. Fabric was a good weight.


LOVE THIS DRESS! This dress fits exactly to the measurement specifications it comes with.


love it !!!!


This dress fit perfectly! Looks just like the picture. I am 5 foot 1 and it came just below my knees. Love this dress!


Read the reviews and ordered medium/large and I love it!


Adorable . nice material


Almost too tight, but it's very wearable. I love the length.
