The dress fits fine and feels soft. Being polyester  will save it for cooler temps.


Fit well around but was a little long for a short person, I'm 5'. But nice material and the dress is lovely.


Purchased as a birthday gift for my best friend and she loved it


Love it! Perfect for my baby shower dress, 5'3, 28 weeks pregnant, usually wear a small pre pregnancy and this small still fit great. everyone says my belly is small but I think it's average. Material is nice so that I get to wear and underwear. Color is just as picture


Exactly what everyone says. Pretty, inexpensive, feels good on, fits well.


Big.  Does not look like pic at all. Material is nice though displayed pic total oppositec of what I received.


Cute, thicker fabric than I was anticipating and I like the pattern, but it's a little too short.


love this dress


Great material and great fit!  Wore with a denim shirt and some great heels and it looked PERFECT!


I really did think it was black, it's navy,I'll get shoes
