This dress is so pretty. It fits perfectly and is real fun and flirty.


This dress is way to small


same as the picture. And I like s lot thank you.


Loved everything about this dress!


I really wanted to like these dresses, but they just fit really weird on me. I ordered a size Small and it was a bit snug on the bottom, but a bit loose on the top. End result being a frumpy kind of look. I'm 5'2" and 105 lbs but have absolutely NO curves. I think that this dress looks best on ladies with some nice hips and a good bust. Other than that, they were super soft, great quality, and the perfect length. Just not for my body type.


Nice drees very fast delivery


Actula color of dress more yellow than in picture
