I purchased this in an XXL because I am a 16/18.  It fit, but not in a way that made me comfortable to sit down without calling attention to my rolls.


Other than my rolls being an issue, it is a lovely dress.  It would look amazing on someone more suited to Asian sizing.


One day!


Beautiful!


The dress is very cute but I can't get used to Asian sizes.  I'm a USA medium but I ordered this in Medium and it fix like an extra small.  I did reorder in a large hoping this fits.  If not - I'll try again in an extra large.


Comfy loungy work dress. Nice to have one in the closet for days where I have to look good and I'm not feeling my best. The floral print looks even better in person.


Loved the style, color is exactly as shown on the picture. My boyfriend loved it!! It fit really nicely, I am curvy (5'6", 168lbs) and got a size L. The material is thick enough to cover any imperfections. As the for the length, I wish it was a bit longer, it went down to about the knees on me. I recommend this dress!


obsessed with this dress. it fit snugly as it's supposed to and looked amazingly. i could wear this all day since it's so comfortable. it's thick enough to feel secure in but not too thick.


Beautiful dress only was too small


I'm pretty petit, and normally wear a large. I ordered the coral solid colored dress in an XL, and the neck hole ended up being far too large. I felt like it was made for a football player with very broad shoulders. The rest fit fairly well, but I couldn't get past the gaping neckline.


My husband bought me this dress. It looks incredible. it fits like a glove. I am 5'10, 190# and it is very flattering to my hourglass shape.  The fabric is nice and thick so that it is not see through, but not hot to wear even in the summer. I highly recommend this dress.


Love this dress, fits true to size
