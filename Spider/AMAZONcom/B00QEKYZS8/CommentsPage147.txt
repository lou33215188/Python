It fits perfectly!  Good quality material...the only thing is that I was expecting it to be a floral print on white, but it's more like a lemon ivory.  Glad I waited until I got the dress to order shoes to go with it.


Don't like the fit. Donated these


Beautiful and comfy,I like the material. I usually buy large so I got the L/XL which actually comes with a tag that says XL. It still fits nicely.


Great dress! It hits to my knees! I LOVE THAT! It looks so classy and sweet, great find on amazon!


Bad purchase


For my daughter it was extremly small


Nice dress, had to send back because style and fabric weight for a younger figure.  If the fabric were thicker, I would have kept.


Good fit.  It was cute!


Perfect fit and length!


Even though it was a little tighter than expected the pattern is so beautiful. I wore it with a cute little cardigan and it was great!
