I love this turquoise dress and the different colors in the flower prints give so much freedom to find all kinds of colorful accessories. I have found my favorite summer dress!


I order tis dress on Thursday and Saturday morning it was at my door..very fast shipping, the dress is super nice I got a xL cuz I'm 5 4 and about 180.. With 40dd and the dress fit perfact show off your shape, its a very nice well fitting dress in fact one of the best dresses I ever order form amazon...I will be getting more.. From the same company..


Sooooo many compliments on this piece of apparel.  After reading the previous reviews, I had nothing to lose as it could be returned if unsatisfactory.  Fit like a glove and is comfy too.


The dress met my expectations it looks just like the picture. Material is good and stretches. It ran a little bit big. Overall I was satisfied.


Love the color, love the style and love the fit!  I'm 5'7 and weigh 145, 36B cup and ordered a medium.  Fits like a glove and the fabric is so comfortable and not see through.  Not much more to say, other than, you won't be disappointed.


I usually wear a medium but have a belly.  this dress was too small overall.  I ended up upsizing.  Still slightly tight in stomach area but it will work.  Top part of new size is perfect.  Dress seems to run small.


Very nice. I will buy another one


This is a great dress, the material felt different than I expected but still a great dress. I bought this for my birthday dinner for this weekend with some great heels, but this dress can be played UP or Down.


This dress is beautiful but when I put it on it was skin tight. Having to return it for the next size up.


This dress is amazing!! It's flattering, the colors are vibrant, and it's true to size. I am 5"5, 125 lbs, and wear a 32B. The only problem in that the shoulders are a little high so I have to pull in down in the back pretty regularly.
