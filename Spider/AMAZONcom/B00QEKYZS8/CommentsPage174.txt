I loved the way this fit but I was not happy with the color. I bought the coral but it was more like a bubble gum pink color.


So pretty! Love the stretchy, soft fabric. Gorgeous!


Cute dress but it's on the smaller side.


I love this dress! The fit is perfect and it's beautiful. Very comfortable.

I LOVE this dress.! Very comfortable.!!! I want to buy it in all the colors.!!!


I bought this dress for my 10 yr high school reunion this weekend. Just got the dress in the mail and I am SO excited to wear it! I am 5'7 and 158 lbs, I bought the M/L and it fits perfect. I like a more fitted fit. I am definitely going to buy the black dress...and maybe more lol.

Perfect length, hits right on my knee (5'6 145lbs), shows off my curves, and is a thick material
