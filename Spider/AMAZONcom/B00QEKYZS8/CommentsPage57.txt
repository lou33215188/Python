Nice look, good fit, uncomfortable fabric.


Couldn't get it even over my head. Was so small there was so way to fit into it. Sad, cause the color was very pretty and the form of it look gorgeous. This item need a better measurements guide.


LIKE A LOT -- IT RISES A LOT WHEN YOU SIT OR WALK (BUT THAT'S BECAUSE i NEED TO LOSE STOMACH)


I love this dress! I'm 5.5 and weigh 135 pounds. I usually wear a medium depending on style. We'll, the medium was so tight , it was unflattering. So I ordered X-large and it fit me perfectly. I was not going for the skin tight show your every curve look. I wanted a beautiful dress I could feel pretty in, not like I was trying make a statement.


Looks great with probably any body type. Material is not see through. I have not washed it yet.


Amazing! I didn't have high hopes for this, particularly since it arrived in the same package as another cheap dress from Amazon that fit awkwardly. This one is great: form fitting without any darting for a weird pouching effect. I'm 5'11 and weigh 120 pounds, so I usually have to have the chest and hips taken in even on smaller sizes. A small fit me great and was a modest enough length for work.


Love these dresses.... Very slimming.. Shows curves.


My husband loves them.


Cute dress. I am 5'5" and weigh about 105. I typically wear a 00 at Express. The dress is fitted but is not skin tight so I can wear it to work. I will be buying more of these in different colors. Really cute!


Very classy dress, falls below the knee for a very nice look.  I also went up to a size xl...it fit great.  I wear a size 12-14.  Best to go up a size or two for a perfect fit !


Comfy and lots of compliments!
