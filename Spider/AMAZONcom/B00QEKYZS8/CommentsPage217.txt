Got on a lightening deal and am happy I found this seller.  I will be a long time buy I believe.


Purchase at least two sizes larger than what you think you need.


One of my go to dresses.


I will be returning it.  It's a super soft dress but the white color is see through.


I love this dress it hugs my curves perfectly


It is stretchy in all the right places! And it is so soft!


I bought two of these dresses and returned the tan version due to it being see through. The black version is beautiful on and fits true to size. I am 5'10 and it is nearly impossible to find a dress that isn't too short. I bought a size small. Perfect color, fits like a glove.


Too small.....and watch out for the 30% restocking fee when you return it!


Love the fit. I hope it washes well. I did order another one.


12/14 5'4 198 pounds. A size large fit perfectly. The fabric is of great quality. I will be ordering additional colors for work!


I checked the size chart,read the reviwes and decided to buy one size up.So,the one I got is confortable.Kind of a little loose because of the size up I orderer but is fine,better this way.I think if I had ordered my size it would be small.
