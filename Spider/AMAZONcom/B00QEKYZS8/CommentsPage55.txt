one of my favorite dresses to wear! its  so comfortable and pretty


This dress looked amazing on me I got so many compliments on it a party this weekend. The material was just as many have commented on, it's thick made from cotton and very comfortable to wear and the colors ars so bold and beautiful. I'm going to order another one soon I'm just waiting for the white one to become available again in my size. I am 195lbs. and bought the xl- xxl and it fit perfect.


I bought the black one back in June. Wore it to a trip to vegas. I'm 5'3 162 kinda pear/hourglass shape. I got the s/m when it came the tag said medium. It fit perfectly. The dress is easy to dress up or down. It hugs my curves nicely and the material is thick and comfy. It hides panty lines well cause of the design and material. I recommend it.


This style is going to make every woman feel beautiful, no matter what her shape.  If you are wondering, BUY THIS DRESS!


Perfect dress! Very tight fitting all the way from the chest down. The sleeves in the arms were a little big, which I prefer because I hate too tight arms. Gives you unattractive arm fat buldge! It's true to its' size as well. Be sure to go off the size chart. I wouldn't order a size smaller if you want the dress to be tight. I promise it is tight!


I love it!


Toms Ware is my new favorite brand for casual dresses! Material and color is amazing, fit is classic and flattering.


Love this dress, the fit is great! I'm 5'4 and about 116 lbs and the small fits me perfectly without being too tight.


The dress is nice and the material good, but it is FAR too small. The seizes are probably Asian.  I am normally L size, but this one is too small in XL size.  It is also much shorter than I would like.  I think the measurements offered in the description are completely off.


Absolutely love this dress! Fits perfect. Nice material. Plan to order more
