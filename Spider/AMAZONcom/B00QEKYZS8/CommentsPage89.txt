I’m 5’2, weigh 147, wear a 36DD. I ordered a size medium. This dress fit absolutely perfect. The material is thick and it is a bit stretchy. I could have sized down, but I like a little room in my dresses. Definitely buying more.


I love this dress. The fit is as expected and the material is thick and not see thru! Can be worn casually or dressed up with a chunky necklace. I bought both the black and the teal/floral.


I am 5'7' and have a curvy figure.  Typically I wear a size 12.  This dress is fitted but it is flattering.  I purchased it as an Easter dress but decided it was a bit too fitted for me to feel comfortable at church.  The material is nice quality and it is a lovely dress for other occassions


Fit was good and as expected.


It looked good on my wife.


Definitely a beautiful, well made dress that's worth the price. If you have the body type for this, it runs pretty true to size. If you carry your weight in your stomach and don't like a visible belly outline, then you might not like it.


Very nice. Not see through giant plus. I got a Medium for 5'5" 130lbs I'm usually small but factored in some shrinkage and wanted to avoid pulling the fabric to a point of it becoming see through it fits perfect.


Luv it.


Pretty


Nice and stretchy for growing moms


Great little dress. I ordered size s/m, but the actual dress has a medium tag. I'm have a larger bottom, but this dress hugs it nicely. Fabric is thicker than I thought it would be. Love the print! I'm 5'1 about 36-27-40 135lbs and the dress comes slightly below my knees.
