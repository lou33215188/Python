Did not like the fit, not flattering at all, too tight


Great dressğŸ‘�ğŸ�¾!!! I got a lot of compliments!


I knew it would be tight but it is a 2nd skin.


Great value


extremely tight


Tooooooo small. If u normally wear a small get an xl


Poor quality


Not flattering


Beautiful dress, hugs every curve! I was worried but fit perfectly.


Love it!!!!
