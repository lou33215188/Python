Very nice dress


Hmmm..dress is ok . I will wear it for a night out. But the material was cheap not stretchy enough to me. It's a nice dress to wear on a summer night out


Love it! Better quality material than expected - nice and thick!


Very cute dress


This dress is huge! The material is towel like which makes it thick and bulky. I returned this dress the same day.


Beautiful dress .


Love!


I had to return this dress. I am 5'2'' and about 145. This dress Size MEDIUM was wayyyyyy to big for me.
