I ordered not thinking it was true size, so it was a little big... the good thing is that the material is of good quality


The dress was supposed to be XS/S but it fit more like a medium/large.


A beautiful dress. A great addition to my wardrobe, was complimented many times. Especially by my boyfriend (which is the most important).


Beautiful!


Fits a little roomy but I like


Love it and fits perfectly


Excellent


I get so many compliments.  Simple cheap comfy and you look cute!


I ordered a small, and once I received it.. It said one size.  False advertisement.


too big
