I'm in love of this dress. Im 5'2" tall and weight 180 lbs, and the L/XL fit perfect. I'm going to order more in different colors.


My new favorite dress, good fabric, stretches well, not see through at all, snug. The neckline is a bit wider than I expected but it still hides my bra strap.


Was very disappointed when I go this dress.  Overall it is very large and I am 5'7" and it hits my leg mid shin.


So cute haven't worn it yet but I love it!


Super comfy. I'm 5'10" 155lbs. Medium is great. Tried a small too, too tight for me.


Exactly how shown in the picture, arrived sooner and its a very confortable dress, got many compliments,  will be ordering a second one soon.


This dress fits nothing as it should. it literally looks like a night gown,but it is comfy :) I'm short so I knew it would be long, but it just didn't suit me


It's a little snug, but I really like it!  Nice fabric and cute colors.


I love this dress! It is a nice heavy material and it fit perfectly. It comes down to my knees and it has very vibrant colors ( the picture is pretty accurate ). I want one in every style!


I get lots of compliments on this dress.
