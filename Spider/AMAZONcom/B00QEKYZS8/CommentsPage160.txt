Nice dress. Well made, form-flattering and appears durable. Quality is okay for the price. I would recommend it.


I expected the color to gradually fade from light to dark like the photo. I was disappointed that it was one solid color. It was a little bit snug for me, but still cute.


Love it. Now I need the perfect shoes.  I'm 5'4 and 170lbs I got a M. I wouldn't change anything about it. U do have to have a nice shape cause it shows ur figure


Nice Light-weight summery dress. Mine fits a little big.  If you're a less busty medium, I would go for the small/medium size instead.


Bought navy slim fit dress and i love it! Definitely buying again!!! Ordered with 2 day shipping and it arrived in 4 days.. still acceptable I guess since the dress is fabbbbbbb!!!!


This dress is somewhat long.  Im 5'4 and it goes to my calves.  I do like this dress and I bought it in a medium.  Perfect fit hugs my curves nicely.


Love these dresses! The blue with the flower pattern is so vibrant as is the black. The beige one is vey pretty but a bit sheer. I ordered These for My wife she is normally a size 6 and 8 in dresses and I ordered a Large. Fits perfectly.


Looks scary big but fits like a glove!!


Supper soft and comfy!


I look super hot in this dress, form fitting but looks super cute!
