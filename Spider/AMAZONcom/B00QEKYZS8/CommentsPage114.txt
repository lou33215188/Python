Perfect fit. Good fabric and it did do ride up while I walked. Great service.


Comfortable and looks great


Love this dress thick stretchy comfortable material doesn't ride up perfect live the patterns now I want one in every color and pattern I look forward to buying a few more


Wrong size. Claimed size S, but on the dress inner label is indicated as Asia:S, US:XS, EU:XS.


Nice dress though.


It was super thin and felt like paper. Not great quality


I am 5'5 and with 41 inches hips.. and the size large fit comfortable...NICE colors... but wish it was cheaper...


Giving this dress 1 star because it runs so small.  Ordered a size up because I read it ran a bit small...but it's still extremely tight.  Very nice material tho.


Amazing dress, It is very flattering on. I can't wait to by more.


I'm pretty small 5'1 108lbs. I ordered a small hoping that it would fit. I ended up giving it to my mom and told her its motivation since she's trying to loose weight. The dress makes me look like a toothpick. 2 stars because it was just like it was pictured. Very pretty dress.


I'm 5'3 123 lbs and I bought a size small. It fits but is a little snug on me.  It  hugs against my curves, figure flattering. It's a cute dress, I like it.
