Dress has a lot of stretch which is great but since my waist is quite small I would have to have it altered. Nice thick material though. good length. This is my third floral Toms dress bought so far.


Color looks different than what pictured.


nice dress, good fabric, it is not see through at all. The only thing was the length, for My specific taste it was a bit too long but i had it shortened and it looks great. no complaints.


I liked this but definitely slim fit. Very pretty but I had to send back


This dress is beautiful . Good fabric . Doest look cheap . Nice fit if you re super skinny . Otherwise it will reveal your flaws even if you wear a shaper . Wanted to keep the dress but will return because of the fit .


great fit


I love the dress and it fit as expected. I normally wear a size 12 so I ordered an Xl


Ordered size L being 157 pounds, 5'7" and 38 d bust. Fitted well. Good purchase


Really nice dress


I got a 2xl and fit amazing loved it
