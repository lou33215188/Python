A little more snug then I was hoping and I normally wear an xs/s but the dress is adorable. Seems flattering but I have not worn it yet only tried it on. Love the colors


Super thin fabric. Shows every single line, bulge, crease, and whatever else on your body. And the length is very long, way below my knee. I am 5'3


couldn't wait to get it.  Very disappointed when I did.  Tiny and see-through.


Definitely size up


I was really skeptical at first, but let me tell you... This dress looks sooo good on me! It fit perfectly. I would definitely order from this seller again!


didnt like it i returned it


I love this dress!! Received plenty of compliments.


I think that if I ordered a medium it would be too big and not fit fitted like this dress should be worn. I do love it still I just can't put on any weight or I'll be out of a dress. The material is not as stretchy as I thought it would be. No room to give but is fitted.


Cute but fits tight. I'm am glad I have curves with a flat stomach. This dress squeezes. I coupled it with a Jean jacket. I like it.


It fit perfectly hugging the right curves and the print detracts from any bumps you don't want to accentuate. This is the second Tom's Ware dress I've bought so I must be a fan! I see a few more in my near future
