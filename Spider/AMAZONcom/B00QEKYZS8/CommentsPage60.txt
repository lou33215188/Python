I bought the dress for my teenage daughter. The dress arrived quickly, and the material is great! It's true to size and looks really awesome on our girl. Covers everything well, and isn't at all see through. Excellent fabric, and excellent price!! Highly recommend!!


Love this dress so much I bought it in two other colors! Fabric is awesome, fits like a glove and perfect style/class for work!!!


I'm 5'6" and 128 pounds. I have very broad shoulders and a cant hide butt. The fit was great the length to my knees and no lingerie lines. I ordered a medium even though I usually wear a small. I didn't want it skin tight. Wearing it to a wedding with tall red strappy sandals.


i love this dress. The material is a thick and the design is beautiful I got the package this week and I am wearing it at work today! i like it so much that I have been looking at other dress by the same people


I love these Tom dresses. This is the perfect fit for me and it is the second dress I purchase from them. My fianc√© loves the way it fits; great material for the price! Highly recommend! I got a M and I am 5'3 weighing approximately 140 pounds.


Love it, have like 3 of them very comfortable and soft


This is a super comfortable and flattering dress. I have it in 2 colors. I get compliments on it every time I wear them.


I bought a very similar dress by hot touch I thought I was buying it in a different color....when I got this I was disappointed as the fabric is kind of thick and much cheaper. I dont really like it.


Dress fits as expected. It's not as stretchy as I thought it would be. Thicker material than I thought. I am 120lb 5'7 , 34C and got a small. If my chest was bigger it would have been too tight. I wish the material was lighter weight... but it is cute on!


I'm 5'1" and the dress fit nicely everywhere the only thing is it reaches below my calf. Still like it !
