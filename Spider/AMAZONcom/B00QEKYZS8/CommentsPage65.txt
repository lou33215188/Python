I love this dress it is so pretty and definitely an eye catcher


I just received this dress in the mail today, and I had to write a review right away because I love it that much! I am 5'7" and 135 lbs. Normally I wear a size 4 or small, but I have had three kids and all the changes that happen to the body as a result of that. I still fit into my size 4 pants but things just aren't as comfortable as they used to be. I am more self-conscious of my figure now that I have been stretched and torn. For that reason I bought this dress in a medium because I didn't want it to be TOO form fitting and show all my mom lumps. It is just right. It is snug and sexy but does not cling to me and for that reason it is just right. It falls just at the top of my knee cap. The material is not thin at all so there is no worry about it being sheer. The fabric is stretchy so that I can move freely even though it is form fitting. I just love the vibrant and feminine colors in  the Floral Sweetheart dress. I opted for the floral instead of the solid color because I was hoping the flower pattern would help disguise my love handles and I couldn't be happier. This dress is beautiful, flattering, sexy.... I haven't washed it yet so I can't say if it will shrink or not or pill.


Dress arrived timely and ready to wear for the evening.  The dress is colorful which i like abd flatters your curves


Very comfortable


I ordered this dress for a family photo shoot for my engagement. It is longer than I thought, but I am only 5'1'. The sleeves are a bit loose but I have a feeling it will shrink when I wash it. Overall a cute dress and I will order other colors.


Very good quality for the price. It is more green than teal (photo is misleading). Would like a length measurement- it was shorter than expected. Definitely more of a "small" fit. Ordered a small/medium and it fits my daughter who is 5-9, 125 lbs. without being tight. Hoping it would fit me (5-11 and 147 lbs). She loves this dress!


Fast shipping.  Fits great  looks great


Tom's Ware is a great place to find high end,  good quality dresses!  I love the feel and fit!  Thanks! ğŸŒ·


I love this dress! The material is thick, and the fit is perfect. I actually purchased it when I was 2 months pregnant, and it was form fitting, and I've been able to wear it throughout my entire pregnancy! Really great dress :)


I rated this 4 stars because the picture makes the dress look like its a coral color or some dark pink but its actually baby pink but the fit is flattering . I ordered a small and I weigh 112lbs and its pretty tight but in a good way. And it came fast!
