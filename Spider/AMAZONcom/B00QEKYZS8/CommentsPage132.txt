I love these dresses! I HAVE SEVERAL


Where has this dress been all my life?! Curve hugging in all the right places. I'll be buying more from this brand in the near future.


The sleves on the dress are very squares weird fit on, also fit too long I'm 5 ft just not happy with the overall fit.


Super Cute, good quality. This is my 2nd purchase from this company. The material is not thin.  The print is like the photo.


I normally wear a small but sized up based on other reviews.  I really should have sized up two sizes.  Not a flattering dress.


Great dress at a great price. I am 5'4 and it hits right above the knee. Nice thick material so it's not see through but not so thick so it won't be hot. I bought the long sleeve version today.


The size is not accurate...3XL actually fits as if it was a size 12


Great quality! Fabric thicker than I expected but still lightweight. Speedy shipping so I'll wear today.


I absolutely love this dress!! I got so many compliments!!


Material is very soft. Does not feel cheap at all. But it's a little bigger than I expected. I'm 5'1 weigh 112 lbs and got a small.
