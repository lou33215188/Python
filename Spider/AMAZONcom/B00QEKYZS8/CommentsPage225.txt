The dress was made for large top/shoulders and small hips. The fabric and quality was nice.


Ordered it one size larger because of previous review, it fits nicely.


The style an fabric was perfect fitted just right but it was too long from height


Very pretty dress and soft material. It fit well and very flattering. I received several compliments!


The dress size ran very small


Love love love this dress!  Bought one size up just to be safe and it fits amazing!


Love it just recieved mine! I tried it on I got a xl and I'm chunky!


Too tight!!!


Read the reviews! It fits snug as was said and you need to buy it a size bigger, but I love the way this dress hugs my curves!!


Nice material
