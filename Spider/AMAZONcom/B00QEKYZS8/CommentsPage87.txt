I ordered by measurement, not my usual size and it fits great- not to tight, but body-grazing. Today is the first day I've worn it and have already had a lot of compliments.


Love how it fits. I ordered a XXL,  and its stretchy but fits awesome. I'm curvy and weight about 230 lbs and I'm 5'6 I was surprised how good it looks. I ordered another Toms wear dress seeing such positive reviews from this company ğŸ˜Š


I cant tell u how much i love this dress!!


It hugs my curves perfectly.


Im 5'7 and 200 lbs i got the xl which looks amazing.


My husband loves it because you can wear it day and to a nice cocktail hour too!!


I want the other colors!!


I'm 140 lbs (big bottom, thin waist), 5'5' . I usually wear a small but ordered a medium based on the recommendations of other reviews.


Too small


A little too form fitting for my liking, I thought it would have more stretch to it. The colors are amazing though which is why I went with four stars.


Great dress. Very comfortable.


Great material will defiantly buy more !


I am 5'7 155lbs . Bust 38C, hip 30.  Bought a size Medium <<< just to help women find the right size.


the dress fit to my body perfectly. I wear these to the office with a cute pair of heels.


I got one for my wife a couple months ago and I had to get another one. She looks hella sexy in them! They complement her curves and hug her body but yet they are still really comfortable and soft.


I'm not the type of person to buy clothes for myself online but I am very happy I took a chance on this dress! I'm pretty curvy (5'3" ~170 lbs) and it fit like a glove. Super easy to wash too.
