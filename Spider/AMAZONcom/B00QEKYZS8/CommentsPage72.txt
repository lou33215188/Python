Nice quality and beautiful print. This is a very form fitting dress and Iâ€™m looking forward to losing those last few stubborn pounds. Really like the dress and it fits true to size.


I love this dress! I did buy a size bigger than normal because I was worried about it being too tight. And it fits perfectly! Get compliments everytime  I wear it.


Wayyyyyy too small.  The color was beautiful but it was so tight, I couldn't get my thoughts in it.


I am IN LOVE with this dress. I was a bit nervous when I got it in and it said XL but it fits perfectly!! The fabric is so soft and comfortable and stretches great. I will be ordering more dresses!


For this price, I wasn't expecting much..... but I was blown away!  I probably won't be using the dryer because the fit is perfect as is.  I also don't want the pretty blue color to fade.


A great buy!!


For the price, this dress is amazing. The cut is very flattering, and the material is thick. This could be dressed up for a night out, or dressed down for everyday. I would recommend it, and I would buy it again!


I love this dress! It's the perfect length and the fabric is just stretchy enough.


I absolutely  love this dress wears and washes well . 5 he color is beautiful and does not fade. You will not be disappointed.


Fits so well, the material is not too thin, I would love it to be an inch longer so it passes my knees but it'll do.  The print is even cuter in real life than in the picture.


Love it
