It's really up to you.  You need a good bra and under garments.  Wanted to show you 2 different people with the  dress on who are both a size 14 with different body shapes.  The dress is an extra large both people are 5 foot 8


I don't normally wear dresses but I took a shot on this one. I read the reviews before I ordered and ordered a size up it fits good but not great  like I wish it would of it's still a good dress at a fair price . If your a person that likes to wear dresses then I recommend ğŸ˜�


Fits loose.


Love, Love,Love ! I wear a US size 12, 40DD bra, so I ordered an XL in black and it fits perfect. The material is thick, stretchy, and not too tight but still shows my curves. I'm going to order the navy blue/pink when my size is back in stock.


Not true to size but I'll keep it anyway- too much trouble to exchange


It fit perfectly. Was fitted with a nice fabric. I would  recommend this.


Va Va Va Voom!!


Sexy I will bye lots of Tom's Ware. I love the stretch. A Good buy.


Omg I absolutely love love love this dress I want every color. I won't do that but I will purchase another very very comfortable and relaxing.


I absolutely love this dress! The flower pattern is vibrant and beautiful. The dress fits so well to my curves! I love the sleeves and the length.  The matirial is soft and comfortable and yet I still look great! I need one in every color!


This is a simple well made dress. I expect to get a lot of wear out of it. I usually wear an XL. Other reviewers suggested I order a size up. The XXL is a comfortable fit. I feel the XL would have fit but not been as comfortable. Thanks for helpful reviews and a well made dress!
