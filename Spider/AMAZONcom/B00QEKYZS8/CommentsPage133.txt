I'm 160 -5'7 got a M fits perfect


If unsure of size order a size up.  I'm a size small and ordered a medium.. Fits just right.  Cute dress and can dress it up or down with shoes


No disappointment here I'm usually a size 16 and the XL fit perfectly


After reading the reviews I thought I'd go win "my usual" size... I'm a 12 so I went with the L/XL and I am so glad I didn't go any larger


Omg!!!!! Love it, love it and so did everyone else!


Great dress! Comfortable and received many compliments when I wore it.


Love this dress the fit is perfect will be ordering more


pretty but too small


This dress fit well.  I especially appreciate the fact that it is not too short as I am tall.  I just wasn't wowed by it in person bc the colors are not vibrant.  Measurements: 5'8",145lbs, 32DD-28-38 (Medium fit perfectly).


How cute! I was actually surprised it was too big on me. I am 5'2 and about 170 lbs. I ordered the XL/XXL because I wanted some breathing room, but it had too many gaps in the dress (waist, hips, arms) so I ordered one size down. I will update once I get the L/XL size. Otherwise the color/design is as shown and looks very flattering on!
