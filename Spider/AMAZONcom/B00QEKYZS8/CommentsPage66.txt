Dress is so stinking cute. Love love love it. Delivery on point. Love the colors. Size is good too


Love this dress. Great fabric and a beautifully constructed dress.  I'm curvy and 5ft3 and a large fits me perfect.  The dress really hugs your curves.  Cute with white converses or heels!


Beautiful fit.  Ordered large as I didn't want it to be tight.  Has nice stretch and fabric is breathable.  Will likely order in another pattern or color.


Like the dress very much.  It does run uncomfortably small.  A medium for a size 2-4?  May be that is a nice fabric and holds tight.


This was a surprise from my husband. I love this dress and  everytime i have worn it, i have got loads of compliment.For this i would have given a 5 STAR.


But just after one wash it has started bobbling. I have to be very careful and wear it occasionally and only handwash it. For this amount the fabric needs to be better.


Very colorful dress, super comfortable with a sexy fit!  I wore it all Spring and Summer, and it always brightened my day! ğŸ˜�


its a cute dress. but the size i got was small/medium based on some of the reviews i read. but buying the small/medium equals to medium. so it was too large. i should have gotten the x-small/small. the sizing is really confusing.


This is one of my favorite dresses in the whole world! I am 5'4" and weigh 116 and I got the medium, although I usually wear a small. It fits wonderfully! The length is exactly was I was looking for-- it hits just a couple inches below my knees. Not too tight, flatters in all the right places. Sleeves are a longer "short-sleeve." I love my new dress!


I'm 5'3, 165 lbs and ordered a large. I absolutely love this dress! It is very flattering even when you have extra curves in less flattering places!  I wear it with a sweater to work since it's long enough & always get compliments.


This dress is absolutely cute. It definitely is a true bodycon dress. Your body has to be in the right shape especially in your mid section! The material is kinda thin and it runs small. I ordered a couple of dresses the same day I ordered this dress in Medium. They all fit well except this one. I wish I would have ordered this dress in a large and it would be Perfect. So yeah very beautiful colors but you might want to order one size up.
