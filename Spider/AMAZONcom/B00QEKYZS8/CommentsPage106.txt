This dress is absolutely gorgeous!  I have it in the beige color too because I love it so much! Very feminine and fits true to size. The material is a little thicker so I wouldn't recommend wearing this on a hot summer day. I am 5'8" and the dress comes right to my knees. Perfect fit and length.


So cute! I am 5'8 115 lbs, atheltic build and ordered a medium per the other reviewers comments. It fit perfectly! I was not looking for a skin tight dress, just something that was form fitting and flattering. This is definitely both. I can easily dress it up or down for many different occasions. Highly recommend


Very ugly material


This dress is great. It fits in all the right places and is really pretty.


Excellent quality, great fit, holds up well through multiple washings.


I love it and I get a ton of compliments on it!!!


Great Product!!!


I ordered the Small/Medium and it fit perfectly. I am 5'5", 140 lbs, hourglass shape.  I would order more if it came in fall colors/earth tones.  Love it!


Good quality. The beige looks more of like a soft yellow in person. Not a true midi style but overall very happy with this purchase


Nice dress. Looks and fits great
