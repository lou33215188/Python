I just wore this dress yesterday and I loved it! I'm 5'9" and the length hit right above my knees. I ordered the Med/Large but the tag says large. If you want this to be loose fit, I would size up. I got so many compliments!!!


I love this dress, it's soft and extremely comfortable. For the price the fabric actually is really nice. It's true to size, too. I'm only 5'  and and 105lbs, small fits perfect for me, so is the length, it's just pass below my knee.


I look very attractive in this dress. The cut is nice for humans with curves and the dark background is nice because I feel it hides my 'imperfections'. The material isn't high quality, but it doesn't look cheap either! Nice enough to wear for a nice evening out on the town!


It's a nice dress! Very comfortable to wear . It's soft and cool.. Barbiedoll


Just got my dress today and I am happy with the fabric quality and cut of the dress! I usually wear an XL/14-16 in dresses and this dress fits snugly but not too tight. the fabric does provide some stretch and it makes my butt look great! perfect for either work or going out for the night, depending on how you accessorize!


Looks nice and maybe with a short sweÃ ter and cute boots


Absolutely love this dress, one of my favorite dresses in my closet. It fits like a glove and makes you look slimmer ğŸ˜€ not something that I expected. Definitely recommend this dress


This dress was just a little off on it's sizing. I usually wear a medium, but by a fortunate mistake I ordered a large and it fit.


Love the thick fabric.  In my opinion these dresses run a size smaller.  It's a really flattering.


Dress is beautiful however I should have sized up


 To an xlarge. Very tight over my pregnant belly. I will have to wait to wear this dress.
