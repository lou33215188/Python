Cute. Don't listen to reviews, do not order up if you want a fitted dress. Didn't even shrink when I washed it, which is a good thing if you order the correct size.


75kg and I bought a L . great buy


Very Very Nice and fast shipping!! I wore this for Easter to church and it is very modest. I am 5'9 with a big bust and this dress came below my knees and did not reveal cleavage. Fabric is not to thin and not to thick it was just right for me. Love it


These dresses are so nice  So affordable  and well made  Even in bigger sizesğŸ’š


Love it!  Fits like a glove; flattering!


Super flattering!  Material is soft, not see through and has the perfect amount of stretch.  Pretty floral pattern.  I ordered the green which looked blue on my laptop screen but is in fact green in real life.  Love this dress and am ordering more in other colors.


I've only worn this dress once and it was quite nice and comfortable.


gorgeous adorable and cute


everyone kept asking where I got this dress from. It looked so good on me .


Fit is spot on, print is nice, enough sleeve to cover pending batwings, ladylike but sexy.  Cannot find a better dress for the price.
