Its so freaking adorable! I love the fabric and its very comfy.


Pretty.  Using it as brides maid dress for outdoor casual wedding. I am 5ft3 165lbs and ordered a XL. Fabric is stretchy.


A bit smaller than expected, but gave me a good weight loss goal to get into it! Otherwise, well made and very flattering!


gorgeous dress. dress up with pearls or down with jean jacket. Buttery soft


Beautiful dress. I'm 5'10" 155 pounds and I bought the XL. There wasn't much extra room so I'm glad I got an XL. I will probably buy a 2XL next time just for comfort.


Get rid of little Black Dress and turn heads with this dress.


Love this dress and fit


Thank you so much.


This dress did not fit properly on my shoulders. I would have had to pull the dress down around them (exposing my bra straps) to make it work. Otherwise it just gaps and looks awkward. The other dresses I've purchased by Tom's fit like a dream, so I will blame my body lol. The quality of the dress, however, was good.


Love this dress, perfect for my body type, 5'7 150 lb. It's flayering in all the right ways, and the pattern is beautiful
