Great quality! I absolutely loved the dress. Its nice and heavy. Great lining not like many others. Definitely get one!


True fit. I wear a size 12. Everyone gave me compliments. I am 5'2 so the dress was a little long but nothing a high heel couldn't fix. Very nice dress.


So pretty


Loved the dress.  Super comfortable (which is rare for a formal dress) and I got lots of compliments on it.  5'8" 130 and the medium fit perfectly


I wear a 4- small was perfect. Surprisingly nice dress for the price. I removed the little bow.


This dress is very beautiful in person. Unfortunately I had to return it do to the line where the hips are. It was accentuated my mid section. :/


A little on the small size, would have been to late to order a different size for when I needed it.


Very very small more like four sizes smaller than stated. Very pretty.


Fits great and looks good on me.


beautiful
