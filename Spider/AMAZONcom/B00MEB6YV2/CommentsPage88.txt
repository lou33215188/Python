Little long, but I am only 5 foot


It is so comfortable! I love it. I cannot wait to wear it!


Great product


I ordered the red color and it is beautiful on. It fits perfect. I am 5'5" and 143lbs and I ordered a medium. Sizing seems to be accurate and its long enough for a 3 inch heel.


Had to return....not hitting the spot for me ...sorry :(


Very cute. true to size! Love it.


Dress is nicely made and fit everywhere perfectly with exception to the chest area, which was smaller.


I love this dress more than I can say! It fits like a glove and is super comfy. I am 5'7" and it touches the floor without shoes.


Can't wait to wear it!! Fits comfortably on the body!!
