Pretty dress but runs very small.


Fits wonderfullly!  I am normally a size 2.  I needed the hem altered and the shoulders taken in a bit.  For a "small" it fit very nicely.  Lovely fabric.


I bought an XL size and fit perfect. I am 5'8 tall and my weight is 178 lbs,


i love the material but im returning it to get a smaller size


This is a gorgeous maxi dress!  Made well, and fits just perfect.  I ordered a medium and I am a size 8, 5-4 and with 2 inch heels it is just right.


I will wear it on a special Cruise evening.  Could not be more pleased!


I love it! I'm a medium ( size 8 ) but I bought a large.


It fits just right. So comfortable, perfect for a wedding or a theme party.


True to size, fast delivery! I ordered small, I'm 5 feet tall & weighs 118lbs. wear size 4 usually. I have just to alter the length because it's too long for me, otherwise, it fits perfectly ❤️


This dress is very pretty.. I am 5'7" and weigh 205. I got the XL. The dress fit my body perfectly. I have big hips and behind with a small stomach and this dress is very complementing to my figure.


Beautiful dress, fits like a dream! Wish I had an excuse to buy every color. 5'6 height will be perfect with heels. Bought a large for 158/34D


It is pretty, but not what I could wear.  There was an issue with the trim.


Seller was awesome and did a return with no problem.


I'd buy from them again no problem.
