Beautiful dress especially for the price but it runs small


Wore it to my company Christmas party and got tons of compliments.  Very comfortable. Fits well.


This is a nice dress but too small for a size 3XL. The dress material is stretchy therefore it hugs every area of your body. Need to sit loose to show its beauty.


fits nice


SLIP UNDER DRESS IS TOO SMALL.


it is ok


Dress looks great.  It is true to picture and true to size.  It has stretch, so it can accommodate women who may need different sizes between their chest/waist/hips.  Dress has a fair amount of static, so plan on getting static guard.


Very elegant dress.  Nice lace work and beautiful color.  Fit me perfectly.


Fits beautiful


I bought the red after the black version became my favorite dress of all time.  It's absolutely gorgeous.
