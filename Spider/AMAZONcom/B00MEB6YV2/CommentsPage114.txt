This item compared to others in the same size runs very small


Beautiful dress and very comfortable!


My sister is going to look beautiful at my wedding! Thank you!


I loved the dress but had to send it back.  I am 5'11" and it hits me mid-calf.  The belt/bow hits way above my natural waistline which on me makes it look like a maternity dress.


This dress was too small. It's runs smaller than any of the reviews said.


Let me starting saying this dress is amazing I never ordered something from online but my first experience prove me wrong the size is little bit hard because I'm very tall otherwise I'm very satisfied


Beautiful dress, great line, easy care and comfortable. I attend a formal event four times a year and I use it each time. Every time I get many complements.


Not true to size


Great dress and the arms are stretchy lace! Very flattering! just my opinion but the arms are too "lacey" for me.


Very good quality, pricing just right
