An awesome dress. Just follow the size outline and measure yourself carefully.  I am a size 16 and a 42" bust and large busted and I bought an XL. It's so stretchy so it fits perfectly and looks elegant.  I shopped all over and found almost every gown I tried on had to be altered.  If the top fit the bottom was too large and visa versa. The stretch factor in this dress makes the fabric cling to the shape of my body. It even makes my arms look slender.  I'm wearing it on a upcoming cruise and I love that I can pack it and it does not wrinkle. I does feel a little warm so I wouldn't wear during the summer months.


This dress is beautiful! I didn't know that it stretches, but not it makes sense to why so many reviews rave about how comfortable it is. I am usually an 8 or a 10 in dresses but I followed the sizing chart, swallowed my pride (lol) and ordered a large. I'm glad I did because it was the correct size for me in this dress. I bought this dress for photo shoots I do by myself and it's loveliness exceeded my expectations. I am very happy with my purchase ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š


This dress is stunning. Was nervous since My midsection wasn't too flat but putting io spanks helps. Spray static remover go lining doesn't cling.


This is a great dress!  Needed something for a formal & traditional wedding ....am 5'7, 195 lbs....had grave concerns that I would look like a sack of navy blue potatoes in this much dress - I ordered a 2x, and the fit is perfect; may hem it an inch or so, or could just wear heels.  It's surprisingly flattering and since it was so inexpensive, even if I do have it hemmed will be way under what I was expecting to spend for a dress for this event.  Love the dark lining under the dark lace.  I do think I'll add a sparkly brooch at the waistline to make sure no one thinks I've worn my fanciest nightgown (it's comfortable enough that it almost could be one), but really, it's truly lovely and I'm delighted with the purchase.


Wore this for son's wedding. It was beautiful. Color is true navy. Very forgiving fabric and design. So comfortable. Fantastic shape with great movement. Detailing unexpected  in dress of this price. I needed to put a stitch in each side of the bow detail to keep it flat. Also-- I don't wear heels and had to hem easily 5 inches but again because it's very forgiving fabric, I basically pinned it up even with the under lining and did quick stitch around.  Based on other reviews, I ordered 2 sizes up from my normal size. My size (L) would have been too small- especially through bust and sleeves, maybe hips. One size up might have worked. 2 sizes worked great- I got all the stretch and comfort and movement with no clinging or riding up.


I am in between sizes so based on reviews I thought I ordered correctly.  Nope.  Now it could be my body shape but it didn't fit in a flattering way.  Its a very sexy comfy dress but you must wear with a spanx-like item for it to work nicely.  I am short, plus size, pear shaped gal and I think this would do well with someone that is more hourglass shaped.  Apple shaped folks (top heavy) would probably do well with this dress as it accentuates the hips and breasts.  For me, if I went up a size to fit my hips better, it would be loose in the top area so I will not be trying another size.


I'm hesitant about online clothes shopping but I am glad I purchased this Miusol dress. My decision to purchas was based on the reviews I've read about this product and the shop as well. I saw other similar design dresses for cheaper but those reviews were awful. I am 5'4" 215, and wear Sz 2xl. I ordered the dress in 2xl and fits great and the elasticity gives some wiggle room. The length is good too since I will be wearing heels. I will be wearing a waist trainer underneath. The lace fabric is beautiful and its full beige lining. I need to buy anti static spray though, and lots of it, so it doesn't cling to my legs. For the price and the quality, I would recommend this product to others.


***UPDATE- I returned this product not because it was defective, but I ended up going a different style of dress for the wedding I will be attending soon.


I wore this to a Scholarship Ball and to a New Year's Eve Dinner/Dance.  It was perfect.  Lace is definitely in this year though, so there were other's there with lace dresses on.  But, this dress was one of the best.  I suggest black satin, peep toe pumps to go with this dress.  I chose black lace, peep toe pumps (4 1/4" so I didn't have to get it hemmed, I'm a shorty) to match the dress, but plain black satin would have been better.  I didn't need a necklace.  I just wore some dangling rocks and a sparkly cuff bracelet.


Took a risk buying this dress online because of Amazon's easy return policy. I am pear shaped so finding stuff to fit smaller upper body and curvy lower body is difficult. It looks exactly as described. I wore it to a formal function. I have never received so many compliments in one night. This dress was amazing, especially for the cost. And it was incredibly comfortable. NOTE: I did take the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size up from normal. Super happy with this purchase!!


I absolutely LOVE this dress! I am 5'7", 136 pounds (mostly in hips/thighs) and ordered the small - fits like a glove! Looks more expensive than it is, for sure. It was very, very "static-y" so I have sprayed it down with Static Guard and have had it hanging in my bathroom for the past few days to get exposure to the humidity. I am wearing it for a work gala, hate shopping, and am very happy I did not have to fight the mall crowd! One thing to note - do not plan on wearing too high of a heel if you are 5'7" or taller... I was going to wear 4" heels but I don't think the dress is going to be long enough for those, so I'm wearing 2.75" heels instead. You *cannot* go wrong with this dress! Knockout!
