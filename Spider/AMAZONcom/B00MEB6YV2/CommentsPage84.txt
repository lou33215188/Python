Bought this dress for my Maid of Honour. It is soft lace and the colour is beautiful! She was concerned about the fit however it complemented her figure well. Great packaging  as well. Glad I bought this dress!


Very slimming dress and fits as expected


Beautiful is the word. I am 5'11 and 200 and this fits perfectly with the exact length. Hits the floor :-) I purchased a XXL.


Fit is a little small also nude comes in different color ranges the nude color underneath makes it look cheap


Wow! So pleased with this purchase! Had to admit that I was worried when I initially bought it, however I am so pleased with both the fit and quality of the dress! Great purchase!


Very beautiful! I loved how it fit and felt!


I can wear a 2x easily. But from reviews I thought I should go a size larger and I did. It was still too small. The 3x fit like a 1x. The dress us very pretty but is not even close to being sized right.


This dress was PERFECT!!! I was initially afraid of the slip color being too white, but it turned out beautifully. I was the Belle of the ball!


So beautiful!!


This is a beautiful dress.  I am 5' 8" and it is exactly the correct length, just brushes the ground in flat shoes.
