For the price of this dress ,are you kidding? Buy it .


Dress fit nicely..the only reason i rate it a 4 because of the bottom layer..statics from the bottom layer  and found it for less after ordering. I did not returned it because I worn it already


It's a beautiful dress, I would definitely order again.


Fits perfect


I ordered this for my wife she loves it and has one thing to say about it. The slip underneath needs a bit of static guard on it. Other than that she couldn't be happier with this.


Just right. I returned the first one because it came too small.


It hugs all of your curves


fits really good.


This is one amazing dress. Purchased it to wear to a formal event, can't wait to wear it.


Did not like the fit at all.  Returned it for another size.
