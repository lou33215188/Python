An XL fitted more like a large. Fortunately I was prepared for that. I love this dress. It's perfect for the event I'm going to.


Looks great on!


Great


I received so many compliments while wearing this dress!  I am a size 6 and busty and the fit was great!  So versatile too.


This dress is beyond my expectation.....this is the best product that Amazon I get. I normally buy my clothes on the designer side but this dress is beyond beautiful and the material is great.


A little tighter than expected but it's a beautiful dress.


Love it. Probably my favorite dress I've ever owned.  It's a little stretchy, so comfortable and slimming.


WOW! What a great dress, I never thought I could look this good in a dress.  Very flattering and very comfortable. Highly recommend


Fits like a glove! Very flattering on, soft and comfortable fabric.


This dress is absolutely beautiful and figure flattering.  Much better quality than expected.
