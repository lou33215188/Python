Love the fit, very flattering, seams are  sewn very well. Compliments a curvy figure. Nice length.


After ordering the dress 3 times and the order being canceled 3 times. I ordered it for the fourth time and it finally went through. Arrived in a timely manner. Dress was wrinkled due to packaging(as are most clothing items purchased on line). Fit a little loose(purchased 2x after reading other reviews, normally wear xl) and had a lot of static for some reason. The lace on the arms felt a little rough. Very light and looks like the picture. Seems cheaply made, like a high dollar lace sun dress but compared to other dresses of this style which cost $100 plus. For the price, you get what you pay for. I just pray it holds up and lasts a while and is not a once or twice wear. Overall it looked nice when I tried it on. Fingers crossed will look and hold up when worn to my church event....#praying


A gorgeous dress, but it runs quite small in bust/torso area and is too long.


Love the look and feel of the fabric. Rave reviews from family!


I like the dress but it's too small I had to order another one


Really a gorgeous dress :)


I bought this dress to wear at 2 weddings last year and got tons of compliments on it. It is soft and falls beautifully. I'm 5'4 and 115 lbs.(33-25-37") got it in small and fits perfectly. Didn't need hemming at all, wore it with heels both times.


Loved it! If it had been a hair longer I'd have given it 5 stars


Just perfect


cant seem to get the sizes right
