Great product.


This is a very pretty dress.  True to size.  I returned due to it not having a "fun" look.  I was wanting for a NYE wedding.


This dress is so pretty. I can't wait to wear it to my grandsons wedding.


I like it and fit as expected


Beautiful comfy dress


Not a good fit for me


Nice product. Lace and lining of satisfactory quality given the price. However, better suited to curvy/voluptuous bodies. Sizing (Small) was fine, but style does not suit slender women. I imagine this dress would be very elegant on curvy women and looked even sexy in pics in black or red, but navy on me looked too prudish as it covered too much skin and there were no contrast between the lining and the lace (both navy). Perhaps if an XS was available, it would be ok. Also, not evident in the picture is a bow at the waist, which may be good or bad depending of your taste. I don't like bows! =]


This dress is comfortable, and beautiful. Mother of the groom dress. Worth it!


Returned a xl and got a 2x and its beautiful but still not as loose as I thought it would be one size up.


Nice concept, construction could use some fine-tuning.
