Wore this to a New Year's Eve work function and got many compliments.  Something different than what I ususally would wear but really liked it.


I purchased two dresses from Miusol to try. My husband and I are attending a Marine Corps Ball next month. He liked this dress on my, but it was a bit shorter than the other (I'm 5'9" tall), and the underskirt on this one was very 'static-y' - crackled with static electricity and wanted to stick to the lace overskirt. Also, the bow on the front was really bent and would have needed to be ironed (How many of us have irons these days? lol).


Other than those things, it was a very pretty dress, quite elegant looking, and looked nice on. But this is the one that I decided against.


I am looking forward to wearing this dress to a masquerade. It is comfortable and fits well. Delivery was prompt and the packaging was intact.


Love the fit, had a lot a room, it's one of those dresses that if you lose weight you can still fit into it. It was a dress I took on my 10th-anniversaryâ€‹ trips.


It's very comfortable and looks great.


I loved this dress. I'm a photographer for a formal event and have to wear a ball gown every year. This dress was my favorite dress I've had so far. I love it. I've had many requests to buy it but it's just too perfect to part with.


Its a beautiful dress. I just wish it went by the exact measurements posted. Purchased a 3x and my normal size is an 16 to 18. I purchased the 3x to be safe and it very fitting with no wiggle room.


Good


it looks good on my daughter and love the price


Seller sent the wrong size, but luckily, it was a snug fit b/c it was too late to exchange it.  Fabric wasn't what I had expected, but dress was beautiful.
