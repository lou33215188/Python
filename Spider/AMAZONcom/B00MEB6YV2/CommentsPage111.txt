Nice dress, looks more expensive, nice lace and fit


It is a beautiful dress but was too small.  Can I exchange it for the next size up please?  thanks hb


I ordered this to wear for Halloween with sugar skull makeup. It fit perfectly and was flattering to my plus size hourglass build.


Great dress and nice fit. My waist was a little loose compared to the rest of the dress but other than that great fit. I am 5ft4 and in heels the dress falls perfectly until the toes of the heel.


Nice dress but not flattering for women with hips or who ar not perfectly happy with their shape.


I love his dress. It fit perfectly


Didn't fit as expected.


It was too small all overall But a beautiful dress


Love this dress, but would love it more if the color of the dress inside was Black too :-)


Not a fan. Lace very dull
