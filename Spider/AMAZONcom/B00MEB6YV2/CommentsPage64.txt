Wore this to a Christmas party& I am still getting compliments today.  Lovely dress, lovely dress.


I got several compliments on the dress and it was very nice. The arms was a little tight, so I guess I could have stood the next size. However, it is an AWESOME dress and served the occasion well.


perfect in every way. I was worried that the neckline may be too low, but it was perfect.  I am 5'9" so getting something that is long enough is hard. This was the perfect length, even with heels. Thank you for such prompt delivery.


I'm returning this because it bags out around my waist and doesn't show off my figure like I wanted it to. I have an athletic figure (5'5"/143 lbs) and typically wear a size 4. I ordered a small. It fit everywhere except for the waist. I put it on, excitedly ran to the mirror, and said "MEH."


This is a beautiful, well - made and extremely comfortable dress. Wasn't quite right for my event, but still a lovely version of this dress. The underslip, while a very comfy jersey (a plus), is also cream-colored, so the contrast is a bit higher than desired (or pictured)


I was scared of ordering due to I didn't know what size to order, but it fit perfectly.


At first I wasn't sure about the dress, the inside is lined with a very soft, thin shirt like material (nude colored).  I put it on and it was perfect, the lining makes it one of the most comfy dresses I've worn for a special occasion.  I received so many compliments on my dress.  Love it!!


I will be buying more from this company Again.  Great clothes for a good deal.  I highly recommend this dress!  The lining of the dress is like jersey sheets.  Had many compliments.  Only downside is you need to use static cling to prevent both layers from sticking together and riding up and showing your knickers.


Absolutely GORGEOUS! Fits perfectly!


Lovely dress with flattering lines.  Very pretty.
