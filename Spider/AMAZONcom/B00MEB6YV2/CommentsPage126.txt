I received great compliments on this dress. It fit me perfectly.


Fit was correct with chart. Excellent fit looks beautiful.


Order this dress 1 size bigger.. The quality of the dress was excellent considering the price


The only issue I had was the size


too long, but otherwise good


Nice fit. Looks great. Great value for money. Had lots of compliments.


I'm 5'10" and the dress was too short not what I expected.  Also the underlining is too white.


The dress was beautiful, comfortable, and fit perfectly.


This dress is so comfortable. Love the dress and love the price, but it isn't exactly what I wasn't for the occasion.


I love my new dress.  Its freaking awesome.


I really love this dress it gave me the look I was looking for, the only thing was I wish it was just a little longer with my heels on.
