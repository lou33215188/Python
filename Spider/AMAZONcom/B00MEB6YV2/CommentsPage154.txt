It fit well. It is a nice heavy dress, but if you are under the age of 50, you will feel matronly frumpy, not Mad Men sexy or classy! I had high hopes for this dress. On the plus side, i ordered it in red, and it is a beautiful deep red, not a cheap bright red.


Looking at this dress online, I wasn't sure about it, but the good reviews convinced me. And they did not lie. It is beautiful, flattering (body-skimming) and - even more important to me personally - comfortable. The inner lining is very soft. I'm going to wear it as my wedding dress next month.


What a beautiful dress! Like all the reviews. It fits your body perfectly. I can't wait to wear it tomorrow for an event.


This dress is asulotly amazing. And it fits perfectly. I am a very curvy women with a nice rack. :-) and I normally wear a size 12 and I order a large. The picture of this dress does not justic. When you see it it's gougorious .


I bought this dress for a cruise.  I arrived 1 week ago and I was very pleased with it.  The lace is beautiful.  It is a bit close but nothing I cannot take care of.  For the cost, this dress is more than worth it.

Perfect and cheap - love, love, love!


This dress is clearly a diffrent dress from what I saw in the photo advertising and the other customers reviews online.


I liked this dress. The V-neck is not nearly as low as the picture looks, so this dress was very modest.


Way too small, and the seam around the butt and hips is awkward.


received great comments on this- it is more for a size 10 woman than a size 8
