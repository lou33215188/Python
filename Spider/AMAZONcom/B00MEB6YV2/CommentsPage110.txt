Lovely , it runs a little small. But a great dress


I'm 5'6" and 130 pounds. I ordered the small and it fit great! The length was an inch above the ground so I wore some flats. Got a few compliments on this dress and felt awesome in it :)


It fits as expected but have to order a size higher.


Very flattering.  Well made. Great value


I'm a size 10-12, 5' 3" and I bought a L. It fits perfectly! The hem hits at my heel and you do need static control.


I will be buying from this company again.


Gorgeous sexy dress and incredibly affordably priced


Great dress. Great quality. Fit as expected


Looked better in picture, may have been the color. Did nothing for me. I won't blame the dress.


It's a beautiful dress so classy and elegant. A must buy


Pretty
