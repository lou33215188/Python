I did A LOT of research before buying this dress.  I needed it for a wedding I was attending & knew I wouldn't have time to return it, if it wasn't what I expected.  Please know that this dress is GORGEOUS!  I got so many compliments.  It works well with all different body types & the navy blue dress has a navy blue slip underneath & was just lovely on my dark skin tone. I am 5'2 and weigh 128 pounds and ordered size small. This dress was the perfect length with heels on, so for all of my taller ladies out there, length might be an issue for you! I was pleasantly surprised to not have this dress drag the ground which is usually the case for me. I'm a prime member so it arrived on time & I am beyond pleased with this elegant dress.


Love the dress, nicely made. Looks Expensive... Got compliments!


Great dress!


It's perfect for short people. I'm 5'7 and this dress came to ankles


I wear a 12 and the LARGE was too snug in the hips. :(
