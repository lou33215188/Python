Beautiful dress and very comfortable.


This a beautiful dress and it fits as expected. I ordered this dress for a dinner banquet and it is perfect for the occasion. I highly recommend this dress for any function.


I am blown away by how gorgeous this dress is! My husband and family could not believe how much I paid for it, it looks much more expensive. Yes, there is A LOT of static but nothing a little static guard can't fix.


This dress is just as described. It's a beautiful navy blue and the lace is a very soft and expensive feeling lace. Well worth the $$. I'd buy it again and again, and I'd definitely recommend it.


I like this dress a lot but the size runs small. I will be returning it as it isn't a good fit for me but it is a wonderful color and very elegant.


It fit well (130 lbs, 5 ft 3, ordered a medium). It's a bit long but will be fine with heels. There's a bit of static cling, but for the price it's an overall great dress. The ribbon at the front wilts a bit but it can be secured with a pin.


too small and really poor cuality.


My first dress arrived ripped and I received another one within days.


Very formfitting and floor length.


I am 64 inch and weight 164 and this dress fits like a glove.


i love it


A terrific, comfortable, very  pretty, and well priced dress that packs really well for travel. The dress fits tight, so I highly recommend using spanx!
