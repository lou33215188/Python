I'm medium size so I order L just in case, the material stretches so it just naturally adjust to the curves of the body, the design its amazing make you feel very girly and confident, the length is good if you are going to wear high heels.


I wore this dress to a wedding this past weekend.  I am a 16 and the XL fit great.  Highlights the curves in a very positive way.  I felt amazing in that dress.  Static guard is a must as it is clingy, but that was no issue.  Great dress at a great price - can't wait to wear it again


This is a pretty dress but it is short geared.  I am 5'8" and the ribbon was way above my waistline.


Beautiful dress


Pretty dress; bad fit!


Although for the rewiews I expected a good product, it was a surprise to find a dress so beautiful and apparent. The dress is a bit long, but it is because I am a short woman. I am very pleased with the purchase, but more than anything because of the fast shipping.


I am shocked at how well it fit, how comfortable it will be to wear.  I am a full figure, and it is very flattering.  Price, value and it - all is actually much better than I expected.


The fit was perfect. I was afraid it would look cheap when I actually received it due to the price point but it was great.


U ordered this dress for my son's wedding. I'm 5'3" and weigh 150 I ordered a large it was perfect even the length with a small heel. A little static guard and off I went. I received tons of compliments and even a few inquiries as to where I purchased the dress..5 stars


I had compliments all night in this dress.  It is so comfortable and easy to wear.  The reviews mentioned static cling and the dress being too short.  I had no issue with static cling.  I am also very tall and wore heels.  The length was perfect.
