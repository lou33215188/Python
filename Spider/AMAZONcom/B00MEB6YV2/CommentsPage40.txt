I bought this dress for a formal and I like it very much. I am giving it 4 stars because the liner under the dress is cream colored and makes it look like you are wearing nothing under it. I wish the liner had been in red!!!! Fits to size and has some stretch to it.


my liked the dress but she believes it ran a little small


This dress is beautiful and classy. I'm 5'6, 148 pounds and the large fit me well. You can't beat this dress for the price!


So pretty! The dress was soft and comfortable. I wish I had ordered one size down because it was a bit loose fitting. Also the dress was quite long and Iâ€™m 5 foot seven.


Received many compliments. Agree it is staticky, but sprayed hairspray on the shell and it was good to go for the evening. The only thing that I did not take into consideration was empire waist with the bow. It excentuated my waist a bit. Spanx helps keep smooth lines.  Length was perfect as I am 5'6".  Bottom has perfect flow and feminine.


I haven't wore it yet it's for my sons wedding on April 16 th. I did try it on of course to see if it fit the length is perfect. the fit is great I have wide hips and  i'm also short. I was worried about that but no worries  it was perfect!!  I read all the reviews and looked at the pictures with customers having the dress on and was very satisfied with their reviews. I am so happy with my purchase now I just have to get shoes to wear with it !!


Beautiful dress. I got a size larger than needed and still tight.


I wore the dress to the Gala and everyone wanted to know where I got it from. Most thought that the dress cost no less than $400. I told them about the great price and comfort of the gown. I highly recommend it.


very beautiful and look just like the picture, but run a size smaller.


This dress is just gorgeous. Goes all the way to the floor but does not drag. I am 5' 8" tall and 200 pounds and ordered an extra large and it fit perfectly.
