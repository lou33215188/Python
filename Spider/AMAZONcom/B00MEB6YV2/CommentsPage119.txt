I'm 5'8", 155lbs, small chest with somewhat wide hips. This dress fit beautifully in a size L. I could have done with a M, but I wanted to be sure it wouldn't be too tight and the L was perfect, not too loose at all.


Did not hit the floor, but rested just at my ankles, which was long enough.


Color was red, but like a dark apple, not too bright but not maroon.


Heavy, warm, good quality dress. Was not disappointed at all!


The dress is great except I'm a size 2 with a super tiny waist and no hips so from the bottom down it doesn't compliment me but if you have curves go for it!


Fit great and looked stunning.  I can't believe I took it out of a box and wore it 10 minutes later to a New Year's Eve party!  Wasn't wrinkled and looked stunning.


Great dress!!


It was flawlessly. I love it. PD


The only thing I don't like is there's no zipper


Get 1-2 sizes up


Beautiful dress and great quality. Stretchy! I did not keep the dress because it didn't suit me well. I personally feel the dress would look great if you have some curves & I do not.


Beautiful dress for the money. Fit perfect and very comfortable


I love it.
