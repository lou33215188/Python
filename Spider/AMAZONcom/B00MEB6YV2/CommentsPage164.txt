What an amazing dress for the price! I love the lace and how soft the dress was. The lace sleeves were not itchy and I sprayed the lining with a static spray and never had any problems with it. I’m 5’2 and wore 2” heels and the bottom hit the floor. I ordered a size small and it fit nicely. For reference I’m a 34D and weight 128.


Hi all, just wanted to say I love your pictures, you look great! The dress is so I pretty, makes me wish I had a reason to wear one.

Stretchy lace. Looks like a $500 dress. Sexy. Covered my arms (that I don't like) but didn't make me feel hot. V neck neckline is slimming. I was able to wear a body shaped underneath because of the high back and nothing showed!!!


I ordered this dress on Friday November 21, 2014 and it was delivered bright and early Monday morning November 24, 2014 just as Amy promised. The dress is gorgeous and extremely flattering. I ordered an extra large based on the reviews (I'm 5'4 178lbs) however I believe a large would have been a better fit as I have lots of room in the dress but it's still a great buy!


I went by other reviews and ordered 1 size too large, it was too late to do an exchange  but the dress is lovely.


This is very pretty. When I took it out of the package and put it on a hanger, I wasn't too sure. Then I tried it on, and it fit perfect and looked really nice.


I returned only because the seam in the middle did not flatter my hips.


I would size up when ordering, especially if you are bottom-heavy. The hip seam of this dress cuts into my behind and I have to keep pulling it down to get it to look right. Also, definitely plan to blast both layers with static guard as they are super clingy.


Wonderfully made is the word. I love it. Nice one. I recommend it for all
