Love this dress! It is beautiful and classy and most importantly to me, it's crazy comfortable. I would recommend spanks or something fitted underneath if you have curves you are trying to smooth out. The fabric is very stretchy


Very nice dress. I got lots of compliments at my event. I ordered a size up and it fit perfectly. Loved it!!!


too tight.


What a gorgeous dress.. Skims the figure..as it hugs it..and yet it's still ladylike.. LOVE LOVE LOVE.


Beautiful dress as well but of the 3 I bought this was my least favourite and I returned it. Quality was very good though, hence the 5 stars.


Nice dress, but way way too small.


Lovely dress and great fit due to the stretchy material. I am a size 16 and ordered the xl. Perfect!!! Gorgeous! Wore it for a wedding and received lots of compliments.


I needed to see how this dress fit and it wasn't bad, but the only reason why to returned this dress was the seems in the front. Other then that I would have loved the dress.


I'm 5 feet tall and the the dress barely hits the floor. Not for tall people.  Also order a size larger.


Love this dress, I really was an unexpected delight.  I had no idea about the fit or anything.  I was really pleased with this buy, would definitely


recommend it.
