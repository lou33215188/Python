Super soft lace. Im a size 8/10 U.S. Has a nice cut of material minimizing butt ğŸ˜Š If a flash goes off w a pic it will reflect to make under liner (peachy color) more aparent.  Loved it!  (Ps name is under my husbands lol)


Searched the mall for 4 hours and came home crying because nothing fit right or looked elegant enough for the black tie wedding I am going to in 5 days. After reading all of the reviews I went ahead and purchased it with my fingers crossed. It fits percectly and looks really elegant and I feel comfortable and really good in it! Im soooo glad I got this dress and Im also glad I listened to the reviews! The picture doesnt do it justice. For reference I am a size 14 and got an XL 5'4"


OMG.....I got this for an formal event and this dress fit perfectly.  I had so many compliments on it.  It wasn't too tight, too long, too anything.  The ladies were shocked that I got this from Amazon of  all places.  I'll be looking to get more from this particular shop.  you really can't beat the price and the quality is top notch too.


***UPDATE**** It stinks I have to go from 5 stars to 1 star.  I really love this dress, but after cleaning it according to the directions on tag, the hems at the neckline and bustline have come undone.  There is no way to repair this either.  It's quite a shame, I was looking forward to wearing this again.


The dress is too snug but that is me not the dress. I knew it might be tight when I ordered it, but I ordered it anyway. I'm going to work very hard to fit into it properly in two months. I really don't want to return it since I LOVE it. I can't say anything bad about this dress. It's very comfortable, the lining is a beige knit and the lace is stretch too. I was worried about it being too low cut, but it's not. Now, i don't have big boobs so if you do, you might think it's low cut. I think this is simply a matter of personal taste. Either way, I think it's just right. It has just a little bit of weight to it so that the dress moves nicely. I thought the length was just right also, although I didn't put shoes on with it. It was just skimming the floor. I'm 5'5" and 1/2". If I wore really high heels it would probably be ankle length. I read other reviews and there were alot of comments on the length and the static. As I said, I think it's a good length for everyone. If you're really tall or short, then you probably are used to making adjustments. As for the static, yes. Very staticy. I don't know why it has so much static but it does. You can probably rub a dryer sheet on it or use some other static dissolving trick. I also want to mention the packaging. It was folded up neatly into a plastic bag and there were no wrinkles when I took it out! You don't have to deal with wrinkles or ironing. This is a simple, elegant dress that anyone wearing will stand out in.


This dress really is the most amazing dress ever. It looks so glamorous and fits like a glove. This dress glides over you (provided you used Static Guard beforehand, it's a must) and the v-neck is perfectly tasteful, and doesn't show too much cleavage, even for more busty gals like myself. Though I can occasionally look lumpy in certain places, I did not feel the need to wear any shapewear or Spanx underneath this dress. I wore this to a wedding - I was complimented constantly on my look, peppered with comments like "1940's movie star" and "didn't I see that in a magazine?". I truly felt like the belle of the ball. I was hedging between the 2X and the 3X - I'm a size 16/18, and apple-shaped - and the 3X fit me nicely. If you're taller, go with the 3X - I'm 5'7", and the 3X seemed to have a bit of extra length. With kitten heels, the bottom hem dusted the ground a bit in the back. If you're shorter than 5'6", expect to need alterations to this size.


My dress had a beige underlay, it looked great, but I've seen some versions of this dress that had a white underlay...the beige looks best, in my opinion. I'm really hoping they'll add different color options for this dress - I'm thinking of purchasing the blue when it becomes available in my size, but the red looks a little too red for my taste, I'd prefer more of a burgundy. Green? Purple? Please please?


Lovely dress with a vintage feel. I wore it to a military ball. Very comfortable, remarkable for the price. Im 5'2", 145lbs and the large was perfect. I plan to buy this dress in other colors.


This dress was fabulous.  I bought a medium.  I'm 5'8", and pear shaped w/the measurements 33" 26" 40". With my shape in mind,  I was worried the dress would be too snug if I ordered a small.


I'm glad I ordered a medium.  The length was great, but I should not that I was only wearing 1" heels, and it wasn't snug but fit nicely over my hips and thighs. The dress is incredibly comfortable to wear too. I got a zillion complements! Everyone commented on how fabulous the neckline is,  which is true.  Even fire a small chested woman,  the neckline looked gorgeous!


You DO need to spray the dress with a ton of static guard,  but once you do that,  it's great.


I wore this for a masquerade event,  but I look forward to being able to wear it again!


I bought the dress because I have a couple events coming up, and wanted something that would work for both.  Im 5'10", wear a 38 DDD bra,  have hips (about a true hourglass), carry my weight right infront of my hips, and dress size...unpredictable! lol; so hard to fit! A little disheartened (when I know Ive lost some weight) I did have to go all the way up to the 3X. However, at 5'10" the dress now touches the floor!!!!  and I have an excuse to buy cute shoes. :-) I ordered the blue, and its a deep saphire blue.  Beautiful color! The lace is super soft and stretchy. Im covered through the bustline, no worries there. Surprisingly, the dress DOES have some weight to it, but not too heavy.  Will have to get proper foundations because when camera flashed, you can see RIGHT THROUGH!  Only giving 4 srars right now because my events arent until late summer/ fall and Im usually so hard to fit I decided to shop early. Right now, seem very pleased.  Will have to see how it wears.  for the price, definitely worth a try for a floor length dress!!!!


I really liked this dress. I bought it to attend a wedding. The lace is pretty and the details too. I gave it 4 stars because it fit good but I had to add some fabric in the bottom because the fabric behind the lace didn't go all the way down so you could see my feet all through the lace. Maybe should've ordered a bigger size so it would be longer.


Overall really pretty dress.


Love it Love it Love It. I purchased this gown to attend my companies Holiday Party. It was an amazing fit. I weigh about 215lbs, 5'5, and it hugged the right areas and hide the right ones too. I highly recommend this dress to my thick sisters:)
