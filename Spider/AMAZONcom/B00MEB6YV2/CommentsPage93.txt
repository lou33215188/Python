My Dress Miusol just came.. and I love it !!!! the material fits perfect !!!  I am very satisfied and would recommend this dress to anyone....regardless of size... Great Job Amazon and thank you Miusol ...


Loved it fits great! Shipped quickly! Great quality for the price


Really great fit. I'm 5'4", 120lb, 32DDD. I ordered a small. Fits like a glove! There were a couple little snags in the material, however. Plan to wear it for Halloween for my Morticia Addams costume.


Beautiful very comfortable and very well made


Gorgeous dress, fits nicely, quality is surprisingly decent. X-large was perfect for size 14-16, 5'7.


Nice and stretchy very comfortable and an unbelievable price. Undergarments cost more than the dress.


I'm so bummed about this dress. I loved it but as soon as I put it on, my husband said I looked naked under it. I couldn't go to the charity ball looking naked. :(


Nice dress just too long for my height .


just didn't like the fit and didn't look correct.


Gorgeous dress!!! Perfect fit, got tons of compliments! Love it!
