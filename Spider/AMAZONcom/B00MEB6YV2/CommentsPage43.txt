I was skeptical because of it's price. After  reading others reviews, I decided to take a shot and buy it. It was worth it. Beautiful dress , true size and affordable.  Customer support were very helpful and fast responding. Very pleased!


I ordered the dress for my sons wedding.  Unfortunately I had to return it because I was told not to wear black to a wedding.  I thought that rule was no longer applicable in 2016 but I guess it is.  I was going to order the same dress  in navy blue but decided not to because I found a dress that matched the wedding colors better.


Very pretty dress but didn't hide my big belly, plus it was rather short for me at 5'9". It looks great in the pictures of the other reviewers, so maybe it just wasn't meant for my body type (apple shape, typically size 14).


Gorgeous! Even on a curvy 5'5 inch size 12!


Although I had to return it because it was too tight across the belly for my preference, I was very impressed by the look and material of the dress. It looks much more expensive than it is! I would have been proud to wear this to the wedding, if it had been a little more flattering.


Beautiful dress! Nice fabric and finish, great waist bow detail.  Fits like a glove!


Received it in less than 24 hrs! Super comfortable, perfect fit. I'm 5"8', 155 lb definitely a pear. Would have ordered L but bought XL based on the reviews, fits like a glove! Seam in the middle is perfect not to show so much my extra-wide hips. Floor length with 1-2 inch heels.


It would look good if you have a slim waist, but if your figure is more straight it doesn't look as good on.


Nice color, but it runs small


This dress is perfect, and it fit me perfect the measurements on this one was accurate i am very satisfied.Thanks
