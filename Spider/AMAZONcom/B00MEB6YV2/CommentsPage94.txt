This dress is as advertised.  A little smaller than I had expected, but since the lace and lining are knit and


stretchy, not really an issue.  Good length to wear with a small heel on my 5'5" frame.


The dress is beautiful, just like the photo, saddly the chosen size was wrong, too small.ğŸ˜”


I love it. It fits well and very elegant


I love this dress!


I did not like it on me even if the size were good.


It was a perfect fit!!!


I ordered this dress for my Niece's Cotillion and I got so many compliments. The dress fit me perfectly.


GORGEOUS!!!! The most flattering dress I have purchased to date! Now I have to find the exact same copy in short sleeve!


The dress looks beautiful on and it's just a pullover style....everyone loved it!


Beautiful dress just seems to be true to size I ordered 2 sizes larger thinking it may run small . But so pretty I may order it again in a different size.smaller
