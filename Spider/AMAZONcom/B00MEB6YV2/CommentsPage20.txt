I'm 5'3", and a size 2-4.  I ordered a small.  The dress is fabulous -- lovely to look at, easy-fit, easy-care and super-comfortable.  It was much too long for me, and difficult to hem because the lining and the lace are of different lengths and drape differently, so I took it to a pro.  Still, a great bargain.  The static cling disappeared once I got the dress out of its bag and shook it out.  This dress will pack easily, with no wrinkles.  It is very slightly short-waisted on me.


This dress does run on the small side. I usually wear a L-XL and had to order an XXL after returning the XL, but it looks absolutely stunning on. Accentuates curves while helping hide some "undesirable" areas. Neck isn't too deep and it hits at the floor for me (I'm 5'4").


This is a GREAT dress! Exactly as pictured, great quality, great fit.


I am 5'3" and 165 lbs. I bought the navy blue XL and it's slightly loose in the waist, but overall, the fit is incredible.


Surprisingly, it's also VERY comfortable! I highly recommend this dress. Lots of bang for your buck.


For reference: I usually wear a size 12 with the occasional 14 thrown in. I am top heavy with large breasts and a bit of a tummy. Dress was a tad tight in a Large. It's also a little too short. I am 5'8" and this hit the floor nicely without shoes. I'm going to try and exchange it for an XL and see how that works. I need it to be long enough for at least 3 inch heels. The dress is beautiful and extremely elegant; it looks and feels much more expensive than it is. I hope the XL fits better!


This dress looked amazing for the price.


I did alter it by removing the bow and adding an application with bead work which made the dress 5 times more chic for just $10 more.


I don't recommend it for an outdoor event as the lace picks up everything like a vacuum, as in I'm not sure I'll be able to wear again cause its is full of grass, but for the price it was still worth it.


I am 5'5 175 with a small waist but big hips ams stomach. My waist is 31 and hips 41. I also have big arms so I like sleeves. I wore blue flats and it was perfecT! I did not need heels and do not like wearing heels. This dress was super comfy and form fitting! I wore my spanx with it and got Tons of compliments! If you don't have a small waist I don't recommend it is not tight and very stretchy plenty of room to breathe. The blue I got was a darker shade and very nice. I ordered a large and it was right on point! I wore to a military Christmas party and  I felt it was elegant, classy, and appropriate. It was easy to dance and socialize. I hope this helps!


I have this dress in black and love it so much I bought it in red as well. I cruise a lot, so need easy to travel "elegant" night dresses. I am also tall 5'9 and most dress are too short and this is perfect length for me. It fits fine, though I did go up one size as according to their size chart, that is what I needed and indeed it does fit great. I roll my clothes when I travel and it unrolled perfectly. I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 as it comes filled with static. I had to use 1/2 can of static guard, iron both the liner and the dress carefully. It took a long time to get the liner to lay right and lots of static guard to do so. Now that that is done, it has stayed in place and I really do love the dress.


This dress is very pretty, but it's not flattering on my body type. I'm 5'8" and 140 pounds.


I am in love with this dress, but it's too small. ğŸ˜­ I bought the black with tan version. Because of the beige slip, every roll shows. I'm so sad because it's a gorgeous dress! If the black lace overlay were less fitted, it would be perfect!!! If you have a beautiful body with no belly roll, get this dress! If you have a little more, I'd suggest trying one of the other colors.


Beautiful in person. Arrived when expected. I'm usually a size 12/14 so I purchased the XL. I would definitely recommend this dress. Will purchase more dresses from this maker. I'm also 5'2' tall.
