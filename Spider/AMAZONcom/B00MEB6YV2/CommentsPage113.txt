Beautiful and fitted well.


need to find a place to wear it to


For the price, this is a well made dress. Lots of compliments received.


Arrived sooner than expected (prime shipping). Classy looking dress with a perfectly fit. Definitely worth the price and with a quality of higher priced dresses


love it.


After reading reviews I went with a size large.  I am about 5'5" 145 lbs and it's perfect. Very comfortable too!


This was a great buy for the money. It fits well, seems to be decent quality, & it's really comfortable. The lining is a thin t-shirt type jersey which I wasn't expecting but am pleased with.


This dress was a bona-fide Hit!  I felt so comfortable in it.I actually could have gone down one size,yet, it still looked amazing and the compliments were flowing at my event. This is my new Wardrobe Malfunction-Free dress!


dress looks nice and fits well  only isseue is static cling to underdress!!
