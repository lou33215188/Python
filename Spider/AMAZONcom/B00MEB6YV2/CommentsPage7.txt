Bought this dress in XL for my mom, following sizing options. It was nowhere near the suggested size, and could not even fit me - and I'm smaller than my mom. I eventually gave it to a very slim teenager as it was not worth the bother to send it back. The fabric seemed cheap and the length barely reaches around the ankles. The waistband was 27 inches (for XL?) The picture is VERY misleading. I will never buy this brand again.


Waaaoooo!  I saw the reviews before purchasing but didn't think it was going to be JUST PERFECT!!  I got a size large, 168pounds 5' 3"?  I got the most compliments in a dress EVER!!!  Beautiful Beautiful!!  I got the red one too, can't wait for an occasion to wear it :)!


Fit was good except I am 5'10 and it was too short.  I knew it would be reading the reviews but I was hoping it won't be that way on me.  If you are tall don't order this dress.  The dress is beautiful though. Super comfy, great for dressing up.  I am taking it to my tailor to see if I can turn it into a shorter dress so I can wear it again. This is the best pic I got all night though :(


Trying to find a dress for my friend's wedding, so I have been trying many from Amazon. I would say this is hands-down one of the most flattering. Very lovely fit, and quite amazing how they achieved that with a simple pull-on dress (no zipper)! I ordered it in the black with nude underlay (I actually thought the underlay was more white instead of flesh-colored when I looked at other reviewer's photos). Because of how skin-colored the underlay is, at least on a fair-skinned Caucasian like me, the effect of this dress is over-the-top sexy and attractive but definitely along the lines of a lingerie-type look. It really looks like you're wearing black lace over bare skin--which we all know is quite stunning. I tried the dress on for my husband and he instantly said that was too suggestive to wear in public. So it's a BEAUTIFUL dress in black=. But if you don't want to give the impression that you're going for an overtly sexy look, I would say the only modest option is the blue, since the underlay on that appears to be blue as well. SO lovely, though, I do hate to return this thing. :(


Amazing dress for the price.  I can't believe this is $50!  It's comfortable, classy and very flattering. The V-neck is cut perfectly...not too low.  I'm a size 8/10 and 36D and the L fit best so I kept that instead of the M.  I'm also 5'0'' so I had to have a few inches taken out. Don't hesitate getting this. Prepare for compliments!


I bought this dress for a black-tie wedding.  I am 5'7'' and 185 lbs and wear sizes 12-14.  The dress is very comfortable. The lace is soft, not scratchy, as seems like it will hold up as well as other similar lacy dresses I have purchased. I've got a bit of a spare tire, plenty of love handles, so I wore Franato Women's Firm Control Slimming Bodysuit Shapewear (also purchased on amazon) and it smoothed my figure enough that the silhouette of this dress looks very nice.  The length is perfect for my height.  The neckline looks better on the model (naturally) which is the only reason I gave 4 stars.  It doesn't dip quite as much on me and the fringe also does its part to hide my cleavage also, making he dress a bit more modest than I expected.  All in all though, it's great.  Looks lovely and formal, doesn't wrinkle, is comfortable, and high quality.


Amazing amazing amazing. Miusol does it again! This dress is fab for EVERYONE of any shape or size. If you like a unique, regal, modest yet still appealing look - THIS DRESS IS IT. I bought the black for a friend and the dress fit her AMAZINGLY she ditched her other outfit and wore it out of the bag. She is a typical14 and I ordered her the XL the fit was perfect. I am a 16/18 36DD 39 49 at 5'2" and I ordered the navy blue and it was amazing as well. A tad long on me but with my hips and a 4" heel, length works ;-)! Again, the pics people posted speaks volumes. Don't contemplate! JUST BUY. I have to get the red too. Wish they would make this in white with the tan underslip... it would be amazing!


I ordered this dress as a back up for a big Hollywood event.  I liked that it doesn't have zippers and that it has stretch to it and I wanted another option in case my other dresses were a bit "snug" :-) There's no shortage of food at the event and all the after parties and I didn't want to limit myself for fear that if I moved the wrong way that I'd break a zipper :-) There is also a lot of walking and moving around so I wanted something comfortable.  I didn't have anything to lose - the price was fantastic and it had a free return on it.  Well, I fell in love with it as soon as I tried it on.  Even though my other gowns fit well & were not by any means snug, I chose this one. I'm glad I did! It is flattering, doesn't compete with accessories, & is super comfortable.  I didn't notice any static cling issues as others have mentioned. The inverted "V" that you can see in the picture is quite flattering if you have a somewhat nice figure.  I got lots of compliments and I only told my closest friend what I paid (she didn't believe it). Why not let them think it was a higher priced dress? :-)


I bought this exact dress in black about a year ago and LOVED it! So much so, that I have been checking back throughout the year to see if they'd ever make it in any colors. Then I saw it - red & blue! THRILLED can't even describe how I felt when I saw it in these colors.


So here's the good: The red is an actual strawberry true red and not the wine color red you see in the picture. The blue is a beautiful royal blue. Both fit as did the black one I bought last year. I'm 5'7, a size 10, and 162 lbs. and bought these dresses in a Large (The sizing runs small even though the material is extremely soft and stretchy...)


Here's the bad: Both the black dress I bought a year ago, and the red dress I just got, have a nude colored lining. So for your average caucasian skin color, these two dresses are perfect for that sexy look that blends nicely with your skin tone under the lace. The blue however has a bright white lining! Literally powder, hospital, almost glow-in-the-dark white! So when you put it on, it's beaming from under the lace and looks very unnatural. Alas, the blue is being returned...  But VERY happy with the black and red.

FYI: I tried both S and M. Kept the SMALL. Perfect. I'm just under 5'3" at 125 lbs with curves and a mom pooch and some wobbly bits. I wear a 32D. I needed a body slimmer with this dress just to smooth it all out and offer a little more confidence, but either way it's an awesome fit!


All the things that work for me about this dress:


- The length is just PERFECT. No hemming needed!! Seriously petite ladies, since when?!?! I wore with a high heel that isn't a stiletto-- in other words, I wore shoes that allowed me to dance and walk! I had so much fun and was so comfortable.


- Shoulders aren't too big. I'm a petite with broad shoulders. I usually don't have trouble with regular sized shoulders but the other formal, lacey dresses with sleeves by Miusol were too big in shoulders. I ordered three others and none fit like this one. Again: perfect.


- The neckline is sexy but not plunging; I think the official image implies a deeper plunge. It's not too much. It's a classy dress.


- Bust was just right. If I had even a little more boob then it would be too small.


- Weight! This dress falls nicely. Really, it's a great quality feel.


- no zipper to wrestle!


- it's inexpensive AND lined! What!?


- Classic look that won't go out of style.


- it's got stretch


- 3/4 sleeves are my favorite
