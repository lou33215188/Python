She looked so sexy in it.  So perfect .


This garment is not "American-sized" and you'll need to go up a couple of sizes and even then I'm not so sure. If you're a size 0 or 2, go for it. It'll look amazing. But for those of us with plenty of curves, look for something else. It may end up depressing you and making you feel like a heifer.

I needed a dress for a masquerade banquet. I searched high and low for an affordable, fancy dress and this was it! I'm 5'9" and a size 14 and this fit perfectly. Looked exactly as pictured. I couldn't believe the quality and size accuracy for the price and being from online. The skirt and lining was kind of static-y so just make sure to use a static spray or something to avoid any clinginess. After having a baby and having my body change a lot, this dress made me feel pretty, attractive, and flattered my body.


Nice dress


I'm a true size 14 and I'm always on the lookout for classy, slightly sexy and beautifully fitting dresses. I came across this dress and after seeing pictures and customer reviews, I decided to purchase the XL and it fits like perfectly. I wear a full on body shaper under and because of the fabric layers, no one can even tell! It's a Kate Middleton knock off ...they did a pretty damn good job with this dress. I've worn it twice and received so many compliments, some even mentioned it looks so expensive.


A timeless dress - well worth the investment.
