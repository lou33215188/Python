Got nothing but compliment! I read all other buyers review and made me feel comfortable to buy this dress without a doubt, too bad to find out the official website was selling this dress at a lower price...


I got a large, I am 5'3", 140lbs, 38/34/36, and fits excellent!


Love the design, the material and everything about it!!!!


Very comfortable dress, not even a zipper to mess with.  Size small worked for me.  I'm 5'5 and 120 lbs.  It fit perfectly.  I will be ordering more dresses from this seller.


Beautiful!  Was perfect for the event I wore it to.  It looks very expensive!


nice for my girlfriend.


Very beautiful. Looks way more expensive. Runs a taaad big but in a good way


This dress is a dream! Fabulous for lean and curvy ladies, I HIGHLY recommend. It is now part of my photo studio collection and my clients (and I) love it! LOVE LOVE LOVE!


Gorgeous and super sexy.


Too big


No zipper on this,dress should've stated that. I wanted to send back. And now it seems I cant. Very disappointed in this dress


Way.  Way.  Way to small
