somewhat small. I returned it because that! but I give 5 stars becauseI love the dress!!! expecially the material! Is so soft and comfortable on your body!! its stretchy and fit perfectly but Im the kind of person that I dont like to show any extra pounds that I have and I decided to return it! OMG delivery was made next day!!


just a little too long but it was perfect  otherwise.


I weigh  175 pound and I'm 5.5 feet tall and I bought an xl and it fit perfectly. I wore it to a wedding and it looked expensive and it was super comfortable. I loved it.


Thank you! form fitting, color is pretty..


It is a beautiful dress. I thought it would be lower cut then it is and that was great! It is flattering and has just enough stretch so it is comfortable.


Fit true to size - the only reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the little bow in the front wasn't attached very well and i had to use garment tape right before we left for event - it was really super comfortable and with the proper support beneath, i felt good in it. i didn't have the problem so much with the static, but i sprayed anyway just in case. I got the shipment right on time and was very pleased.


After the first 2 dresses I didn't expect this one to be the one. BUT I WAS Wrong. Love the dress. Shows off the curves in all the right places. I don't even need to get it hemmed. Great dress for my daughter's wedding.


Fit perfect, comfortable  but dressy and  looked fabulous for wedding. Ordered large which is regular for my size which is 11.


The dress is very pretty but was too small on me even though I got 2 sizes larger than my usual size.


Overall, the dress is OK, but the ribbon/bow at the waist hits me too high (more like empire than at the waist), and the white lining shows through (black may have been a better choice for the lining).
