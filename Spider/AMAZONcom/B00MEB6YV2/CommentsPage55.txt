Had to returned... Didn't fit... Beautiful dress...


excelente


Wore this to a wedding, it fit and looked wonderful. Itâ€™s so elegant and very curvy friendly. I got so many compliments.


Came in pretty quick. Fits as expected, read the sizing chart and other customer suggestions for sizing. It is a beautiful dress but had too many lose threads for me to be happy with the purchase.


This dress is really beautiful and true to size. If you're not sure what size you need just follow the size chart and it will steer you to the right size. The material is really nice and the dress honestly looks just like the picture. It's a very fine dress for the price. The delivery was fabulous and it arrived before the estimated time. It looks great no matter your body type or age, and it adjusts to your frame. Perfect for a gala or fancy dinner. If you think you need a bigger size, you don't. The size chart is accurate.


Love this dress! I did have to reorder another in the same size, as the one I received had an extra bit of lace sewn in the seam on the left side. Also will have to tack the bow on the front as it is floppy & hem the lace as it is too long for my 5'4" height. .


Absolutely love it!! True to size and no alterations are needed! ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»ğŸ‘�ğŸ�»ğŸ‘�ğŸ�» Highly recommend this item for Mother of the Bride


This dress is very flattering and I'm a full figured woman. I love this dress and you can't beat the price!


5'10 true to fit. I initially ordered an XL I returned it due to tightness in breast area. Very easy return. I reordered xxl and fits better, I think anything bigger would be loose. I ordered the red one..beautiful rich color. I've already looking for my next dress. Great price.


It didn't look good. Returned it. Cheap material.
