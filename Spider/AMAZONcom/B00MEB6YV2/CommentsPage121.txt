love the dress


beautiful dress. im 5'4 and the length reaches my ankle- that's the only draw back- i wish it was atleast 2 inches longer. the fit is as described. this dress arrived in 3 days of order. its a beautiful dress and def worth the money.


It is a little large and I haven't figured out how to adjust it, but I am sure I can. It is a gorgeous looking dress


Love this dress so much I bought it in two colors!


Loved this dress. Fit perfectly; no hemming needed. I'm 5'4 and wore with 3 inch heels. Just hit the floor. I weight 155 so I ordered  the large. Very comfortable and doesn't look inexpensive. Many complements!


Also great dress for the price will be proud to wear to sons wedding will be adding camouflage sash to keep with the theme.


Well made and perfect for occassion.


Dress came in time. Amazon Prime is GREAT!


For the price you couldnt beat it. Kinda cheaply made..but serve the purpose.


Very good fit, if I would lose about ten more pounds I would look exquisite, but that's on me, for the price well worth the buy.


YEEEESSSSSSS!!!!! Needed it asap and received it FAST!!!! Will definitely be buying from here again. Thank you!!!!!! Oh and the dress fit as described......
