Horrible fabric - definitely not worth $50. The lining is jersey sheet material....


LOVE...BASICALLY A BUILT IN SMOOTHIE!!


This is a nice Dress....The Price is Right!


An extra Dress for my wardrobe.....However; for me the Bodice, waist up


was for a little taller Person and will have to be altered...A very nice dress,


To have on hand for any special occasion.


Purchased the Navy color which has a dark lining under the lace and it is classily beautiful! I am 5'4" and 145 lbs and the large fits perfectly except had to shorten hem slightly. So many compliments as the dress looks very expensive! An amazing value and Highly Recommended!!


This is a great dress but the review that said order 2 sizes bigger than usual was completely right. I had to return the xl and go up another size. It still requires spanx (at least for me) but its very flattering with the new size. The quality appears good and I'm excited to wear it to my sons wedding.


very well made


Nice fitting dress that looked great on and I received lots of compliments, too.


Very stylish and fits well to the curves.


I'm 5'7' and this dress was about two inches above the ground with no shoes on. I was planning on wearing it with high heels and did need it to be longer. The dress fit well everywhere else otherwise (size M). I returned the product, the refund was prompt and customer service is awesome.


Fabric is strechy, ok quality but lace got little lumps after washing it (dry cleaned) you get what you pay for. It's good for a one or two night thing..
