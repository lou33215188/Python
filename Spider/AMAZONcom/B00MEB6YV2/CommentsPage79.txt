Nice dress dissapointed with sizing. Order a XXL and didnt fit where I am normally a L or XL.


too small, not as expect in design


Wore this to my daughter's wedding and received so many compliments. It is super comfortable and doesn't wrinkle. I added a rhinestone pin to the satin belt, which really added sparkle.  Great dress!!


I like the dress very much but it is a bit too small in the hips, I need to return it but I'm having difficulty contacting Amazon and the seller....


Beautiful dress!!!!!


Husband loves it.


This dress is beautiful.  Hugs your curves while hiding problem areas.


THIS DRESS IS BEAUTIFUL! The fit, the quality and the length. I am 5'3 and 195lbs (thick), I ordered a XL, it fits perfect!


Too small


This  dress was not what I expected. It was too large and heavy. I will be returning it because I found something else.
