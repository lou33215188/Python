Exchanged it for another dress but should have kept this one.


Love this dress! I am 5'3 149 pounds curvy with 36 DDD. I originally bought a large but it was too big the medium fit perfectly. This is for a black tie work event. It's comfortable and feels great for the price I love it! I'm glad I didn't have to pay a large amount of money for a dress I would only wear once!


Love this dress! Wore it to a Black and White Ball and received several compliments. Fit was a bit snug but still a beautiful gown. The lining is well-constructed and did not bunch up as I walked.


This is a gorgeous gown. I ordered it for Christmas Eve, and it came lightning fast! It actually arrived a day earlier than what Amazon estimated.


It fits like a glove. The slightly stretchy fabric gives to fit my womanlg curves. I am 5'7", 145 lbs., 36-26-42. The medium accommodated my, ahem, larger derriere.


Two months later, it's held up through gentle washes on my washer's delicate cycle, looking just like it did when I got it.


It was a fine dress but it just doesn't work for me. I recommend it but its hard to get on and off.


The most beautiful :dress!  Well made. Perfect length. I'm 5 '4" and I dint have to alter it..the lace is like the old fashioned lace of yesterday . I'm very pleased with the dress


OMG I love shopping here, Amazon is the best, before it took me a few days to find a dress that I liked but it was very easy to find my favorite dress on Amazon , in a few minutes I found it ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�»ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�» amazing, and I am very happy ğŸ˜Š


Perfect fit, but too long.


The dress was very nice but didn't look good in me..I returned it and got a full refund


I was a little worried ordering this dress online, but I couldn't be happier with it. It fits me perfectly, is quite slimming. The flexible fabric also makes this dress incredibly comfortable.
