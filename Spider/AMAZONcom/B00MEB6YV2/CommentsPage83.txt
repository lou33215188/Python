I generally wear size medium to large shirts and about size 10-12 jeans. I purchased the dress in a large and it fits amazing. It is very flattering. Would buy again.


Absolutely perfect.  Fits as expected


Looks so classy - feels like it was way more expense that it actually was - must have


Wore this to a Hollywood themed party. It was comfortable, lightweight for dancing and fit like a glove. LOVE this dress.


It had bad static cling at first until I rubbed a dryer sheet on it.  The dress was comfortable because it stretched.  It was light-weight.  I had a lot of favorable compliments about this dress.  I wear a size 14 but the size chart said to get a 16.  I was happy with the fit.


Very comfortable I got a lot of compliments


While this did fit me, it was a bit to matronly for me so I ended up returning it. It also seemed to have lots of extra fabric around the waist. Of course I am short waisted so it might have been me and not the dress.


Very pretty on, but low cut. and fit a bit snug showed off too many curves.
