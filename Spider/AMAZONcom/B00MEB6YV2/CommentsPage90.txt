GREAT FIT - ACTUAL SIZE....


Amazing fit but does require spanx to make it fall correctly through the middle.  Very flattering!


Beautiful well made dress for the price.


this pretty beautiful dress is what im wearing for my niece wedding and i know i am going to get lots of questions of "where did i get it"


SUPER nice for the price!!  Not NEARLY as low cut as the picture.


OMG, as all the earlier reviews stated this is a lovely dress, fits amazing and for the price, just amazing.  If you want elegance and affordability in a dress - look no further.


Amazing dress!


I can't wait to wear this dress for my upcoming wedding. It is gorgeous on, fits like a glove, and makes me feel confidant. Quality is great and it is so comfortable.


I wear a size 12 in dresses so I got a size L and it fits perfectly. My husband and family members loves this dress on me will be wearing it for a wedding this saturday


I like love this dress only odd is the red more like burgandy color than red and long enough for high heels come come quicker too
