Very happy with my purchase and know its going to be a hit at the event


One word, Amaziiiinnngggg


This was the dress chosen for a wedding I'm in. I was a little hesitant because of the lace, thinking it may be uncomfortable.  As soon as I put the dress on, I was in love.  It was so comfortable.  It was soft, lightweight, and had a little stretch for comfort.  I would highly recommend!


You would think I paid much-much more for this dress and its so very comfortable. It fits like it was cut for me and everyone I've tried it on for just loves it!  It's beautiful. I'm so happy with this dress! I will come back to this company, thank you, good work!


DO NOT follow the size chart!!  Not even close!!


Gorgeous dress! Perfect  for my Morticia Addams costume!!  As others have noted, it is a little staticky,  but a little antistatic spray does the trick. Im 5'5" and wear a 10/12 -  bought a M so it would be sleek and fitted.  it fits just as I hoped and is very comfortable.


Absolutely lovely dress, but it was not right for the wedding.


Very flattering and well made for the price. I love it!


This s a well made dress, fits very nice as expected.
