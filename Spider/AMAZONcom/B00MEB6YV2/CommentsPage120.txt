This dress looks amazing on! The under dress is a soft t-shirt material and has a nice stretch to it. Sexy and comfortable. So glad I bought this dress!!!!!


order a sixe larger than I wear


Amazing quality, I'm so impressed and pleased!


Fix is good but sleeves are tight. Quality is not the best but will probably look ok with jewelry accessory.


Love the dress. Fits perfect. The only thing some static cling however nothing a little static guard can't fix.


Great dress and great price ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


This dress fit very well. I received many compliments on it. Great buy!


I love it.  It has a lot of static though, more than I thought possible and the jersey material is hot underneath but since it's winter so I like it.


The dress was very soft, and the fit was as expected however the static cling drove me nuts and I had to return.


Just got this for New Year's Eve... Fits like a glove!!!!! Stretchy so it fits to your curves!! Love!!! Great quality!!
