I'm 5"2, 120lbs and ordered a medium. It fit perfect and the length was perfect. I just wish it had a deeper v-neck line. Can't wait to wear it.


Fits good, happy with my purchase


I purchased this dress in Navy for a wedding. The dress arrived as pictured and fit better than I expected. I received several compliments. I am 5'1 and the dress was a tad bit long for me, but worked out fine with the heels I wore.


This is a gorgeous and I can't believe how little I paid for it!!!  It does have static issues, but who cares when it looks as good as it does!  LOVE IT!!!


What a beautiful Gown, great for a cruise because you can fold it and zip in a bag. I read many of the reviews before I purchased and they were right its a beautiful dress , great price . amazing comfortable fit, stretch!!!


It arrived when it said, fit was just as others described haven't worn it yet. I am 5'4 and I will not need really high heels length is perfect for me. Color is the prefect navy too.


It's probably me, not the dress. I'm 5'6" 150 lbs and bought the large. However, I'm very long waisted, with long arms, so the waistline looked like an empire style on me, emphasizing belly below, and the sleeves barely grazed my elbows. It fit great everywhere else though, and the stretchy lace fabric and lining had a nice heavy weight to it.  Too bad, it's going back.


True to size , sexy looking and very classy


The dress fit - But the last seam on the bottom (the one right below the waist) made the dress fit weird. And it was a little short. I'm 5'7" and it came to my ankles, a little shorter than I would prefer) I returned it. However, the dress was made well, nice material, no complaints in that department!


Looooved this dress super elegant....
