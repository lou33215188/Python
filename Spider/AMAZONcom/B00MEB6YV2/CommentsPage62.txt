Lace is beautiful and soft. The only thing I would change about the dress is the small bow. I may remove it and do a little bling instead.


Same comments at other reviewers - very static-y and runs a bit short, but the dress is very well made and looks GORGEOUS on. As for the static, static spray works very well and for the length, no one noticed except for me. I wore this dress to my company's holiday party, my friends thought I paid a fortune and was told I was the best dressed that evening.


Beautiful dress. Form-fitting, looks much more expensive than it was. Has as seam in a strange location across the pelvis and butt - but I think it is still a keeper.


This is a really beautiful and well made dress. I expected for this price I would get something flimsy but this dress is made with heavy fabric and elegant lace. I feel like a million dollar in this dress and I can't wait to wear it for my company's party. I am 5'7, 150 lb and medium fits perfectly.


The dress is lovely,  It is made well and fits beautifully.  The quality of the garment is exceptional.. I actually went back to order one in the light blue color and it was SOLD out...no wonder!


I bought this for a tall woman who always complains that most dresses fit on her like a shirt. This fits her perfectly. She says it's good quality and it's appropriate for so many different occasions.


I actually came across a photo of the Princess of Wales in this same dress.  It looked better on her because she is thin.  I have more of a fuller figure so it presented fitting challenges for me.  Beautiful dress none-the-less.


Wore to a military Christmas party, received compliments galore. Just lost a lot of weight (size 12 to size 6), it fit my actual CURVES, perfectly.


Flattering and I get compliments whenever I wear it. I'm 5'5", about 120 lbs, and was glad I went with the medium.


Frumpy. I sent it back.
