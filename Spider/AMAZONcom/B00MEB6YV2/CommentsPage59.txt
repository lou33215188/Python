This dress was absolutely gorgeous. Make sure you wear your undergarments and DEFINITELY spray with static guard. I bought the travel sized one and used the whole bottle.  This is a gorgeous dress though.


This dress was the center of attention - I have never received so many compliments from strangers. Material is SUPER soft.  The only complaint is that there are no wash instructions anywhere on dress or packaging.


Love ! It is gorgeous . This dress looks like and made like dresses that are several hundred dollars from Nordstrom . The lace is stretchy it fits very well and flattering even on my post baby body !


Color was not as expected! Should be red was more like raspberry, quality of material poor, not worth the cost to return!!! Very disappointed


I really liked only think I dislake its type of lace they use looks to ship and poor quality other than that I love it!


Pretty dress, but it is sized about three sizes too small.


Absolutely love this dress. My sister and I are directors of our nephews wedding and wanted the same dress. The ease of just pulling on over your head is wonderful. We are curvy but they look great. Everyone loves them and the price is right.


i like this a lot.  however, the bride wanted us to wear non-black or light colors, so i had to return it.  i like it but i don't have a lot of formal functions to wear this.


Good Product fit as expected.


Super excellent gorgeous dress!  Believe everyone!  Fits as expected, sexy and curve flattering as anything!  No zipper to spoil the nice lines of the dress.  Great styling and design.  Super comfortable and a ridiculously low price.  Buy it!
