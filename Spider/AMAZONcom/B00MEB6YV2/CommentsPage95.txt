Absolutely love this dress. I have never bought a gown on line but with limited time frame, I took a chance.  So glad I did. Great quality and the price could not be beat.


Did not look as expected.  Runs short!


Purchased this dress for my aunt to wear to her daughter wedding, the dress was lovely


Thought the style might not be the best for the occasion I would be attending.


Love this dress! Can't say anything bad about it. Exceeded my expectations! :)


Very comfortable !


Loooooove this dress soooooo many compliments. Comfy, stretches perfectly without loosing it's shape.


My wife really likes it.


This is going to be the best maxi dress ever - perfect for an event soon with a James Bond theme and fits and feels wonderful.  Happy Happy and will buy the brand again.  5'7" size 14 and went with XL just in case - stretchy so you can breath - can't wait for the party!


I love it!  I was so nervous to order online but it worked out perfectly!  Thank you so much!
