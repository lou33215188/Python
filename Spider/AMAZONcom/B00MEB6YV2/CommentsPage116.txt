This is a beautiful dress I wear it to a wedding fits great


Stunning.  Classy.  Fits like a us size should!


I was under the impression it fit true to size but it didn't! I had to return it I hope I get a refund!


I love it.


this is so, so pretty. really elegant and flattering


This dress is very stylish and fits perfect. Just way too long,but that's easy to fix.  What a deal!!!


I'm very busty (44DD) with a pants size 16. I looked awesome in this dress. It was very comfortable and the length was perfect.


Awesome. No zipper and it being a pull over dress is only complaint


Fit like a glove and is beautiful! I got it for a 1920's party but plan to wear it to formal events in the future. So many compliments!


the fabric is so soft and beautiful lace!


timeless dress that i will wear for many years!
