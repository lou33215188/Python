Definitely worth the purchase! If your uncertain of the size, take the time to measure yourself.


The dress was beautiful but my body ws not quite ready for it!!!!


Inexpensive dress-up dress but don't expect great quality as it snags easily. However, for the price, it worked out nicely for the occasion.


Definitely Chinese sizing. Sized up and still tight. Returning.


Fits excellent, I love this dress.


love  fit color style  thank you


It's really good quality and fits really good. The only issue I have that underdressed is too light beige and just asking for darker color


This dress is stunning on me.  I'm very curvey and this enhances the curves even more.  It feels so comfortable, as soon as I get my hair done and go to the event, I will post a picture.
