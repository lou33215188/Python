Fit as expected but for length don't get if you're taller than 5'6". For me it hits the floor without heels but just barely. Would be better if longer. Good thing it was a good price and it'll be long enough for one of my shorter girls.


Beautiful dress.  I added lace at the bottom to make longer.  It was perfect


It's ok, but too matronly for me! I was planning to shorten the sleeves, as the rest of the dress fits well and the material is nice and heavy; not some cheap lace at all.


My mom looks so beautiful in this dress. This dress is stretchy so it show off her curves.


Nice quality and great fit.


I really liked this dress and hoped if would fit so that i could ware it to an event in 3 days.  but it runs small,  its stretchy which is great but it showed every roll.  But;  its well made and very pretty I wish i could keep it.


amazing. So many complements on this last minute purchase for a work Gala! fits like a glove, fabric is wonderful (a bit staticky but easily fixed with a dryer sheet and some hairspray), and sooooo comfortable! I wish I had more places to wear this! Same day delivery - incredible price and product. Can't beat it!


Beautiful dress, got tons of compliments. The Navy blue is a beautiful color. It fit my curves just right. I'm a size 14, and have a terrible belly gut and this dress covered it well but I did have to get a 2x in order for it not to such to tightly.


Dress if nicely and looked great.


This dress is actually surprisingly decent quality considering it's price point.  It doesn't have a closure so make sure you realize it will pull over your head. The lace is a very pretty design. It looks more expensive. The bow detail is actually made from elastic and not grosgrain. I ended up having to sew a stitch in in so it would lay flat to the dress.  Overall, a nice dress for the money. Thank you!
