Great dress, especially for the price. Looks like the picture. Need static guard as others mentioned. Tried it on and it fit perfectly. Height is 5'5" and the length is perfect.  I am a size 14 and ordered the XL, it's form fitting but looks great. Can't wait to wear it to the black tie event I bought it for.


I gave this one size up as I was not sure if the size would have been as stated. the fit was still good and I am very pleased with the entire product. If I had gone with the size guide as stated I would not have been disappointed, it is accurate. Great experience overall with this supplier


Nice quality but I didn't like the fitting. Was'nt figure flattering.

I loved this dress!! I got many compliments. It hugged my body in all the right places. I felt very beautiful in it.


WOW! What a dress , fits great. Wasn't too sure what to expect for the price, but very pleased!


dress fit my wife beautifully, but returned it because I thought the style looked too much like something that would be worn in the


Adams Family, and not appropriate for the function we were attending


This dress is exactly what I expected.  I ordered 2X size.  I'm 5'4" and weight around 178 lbs.  The dress fits snug, but comfortable because of the stretchy material, but is very pretty.  It is a little long, but I expected that because of my height.


This lovely Miusol dress fits if it has been tailored for my body, love it.  I can whole heartedly endorse this item.
