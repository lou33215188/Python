Has static as previously mentioned.  But other wise looks lovely.


Surprising and beautiful.


Not as fancy as in picture but very comfortable and I was able to accessorize it to suit a black tie optional event.


The dress looked very nice. I bought the L size and it fitted my post baby body really well. It looked very sophisticated given the price. I am very pleased with the dress and can't wait to wear it to the occasion this week.


too big


Very flattering & perfect length . I'm 5'5".


Way too small even though I ordered a size smaller than I normally wear (based on other reviews).  I want to return it but have no instructions or even a packing list available.


Beautiful dress, just didn't fit as snug as I had hoped and was a little long (with 3 inch heels). To put into context, I'm 5'1" and about 100 pounds so I am extremely petite. Fit my sister beautifully though so was a great buy, especially for the price!


Beautiful.


Thank you.
