The size XL is smaller than the typical XL size.


Love the dress. Material is great for the price. Plan to wear this to a wedding.


This dress looked stunning on my girlfriend. It fit her very well even after worrying about how the size would translate. Will be buying again from this company


Very nice, fits as expected, worth every penny.


This dress is cheap and fits poorly. I returned it! Maybe other like it.


I ordered a L..I'm 5'6 155lbs.  It's maybe a touch too short on me, but looked nice.  Lots of compliments.


It is a nice dress but it was short on length. But good for the price


Does not look on the body as shown . I wish to return the gown. My wife hates it


great


Awesome dress. Fit perfectly. Great value!
