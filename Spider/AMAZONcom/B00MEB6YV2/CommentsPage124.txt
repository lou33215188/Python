Beautiful dress but is not true to size.


Happy with theachother dress and how it came in the mail.


It's an absolutely beautiful dress. I'm a larger girl and I'm wearing it in a wedding and it looks great on me. I'm excited about this dress.


I bought this dress for a wedding and I must say I was extremely nervous about the quality and size. I really liked the dress. It fit perfectly and was a great quality. I am very happy.


It was as expected


It look so good on. I wear it to a Christmas party and omg it was sooo gorgeous for the price.


Would purchase again with this seller


Bought this for my Halloween costume and it is extremely short. Pretty dress, but I'm 5'8 and it only goes to right above my ankles. I'll be returning this item.


I love the cloth l can still wear it but it little bit small next time l will pick 1X


Very nice dress for the price. Got several compliments.


Dress is okay, but it arrived without sleeves! I will be sending back.
