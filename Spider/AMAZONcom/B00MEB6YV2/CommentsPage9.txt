I'm 5'8", 145-150 lbs, 36C and I bought the Navy/Medium for a formal holiday party. This dress was too short for my liking. My shoes were gorgeous so it wouldn't have been a big problem, but for a formal event it seemed awkward that it didn't go to the floor (such as shown in the picture). Overall it fit very well and was very comfortable. I love the fact that it slipped on over my head without buttons or zippers. It came out of the packaging ready to go with very few wrinkles, especially with the dark color. It was very flowy and twirled well. The lace v-neck was nicer in person than in the photo; I was afraid of an Elvira vibe but it didn't give off that vibe at all. Overall I did not keep the dress because I bought the 


 and loved it so much that I kept it (despite not going to the party after all), but this would be a good formal option for parties, weddings, etc.


This dress was great.  I had  to do a 1940's theme and this dress did the job with red lipstick and red nails. I'm 5.8" and I weigh 163 Lb.  I have been trying to loose weight so I still have a bit of a tummy.  I wore a sinch under the dress to suck that tummy in and it worked perfect. Here are pictures without the under garments.


I honestly can't get over how perfect this dress was! I had to find a dress for a ball I was attending, and kind of ordered this online as a whim. I though "there's no way a dress this cheap will actually look good on, let alone fit me." How WRONG I was! I'm pretty short (5'2" on a good day) and was assuming this would be too long. Not the case! With my heels (I'd say they're ~3-4 inches?) it was the perfect length. It also fit all my curves, and I got so many compliments at the fancy ball! This is a crazy deal for a dress that it seems like everyone looks good in!


Although I did end up returning this dress without being able to wear it to the event I had in mind due to a flaw, I would definitely order it again if I had another place to wear it to.  The dress itself was beautiful and fit like a glove (My significant other was disappointed that I had to go with an alternate dress).  I ordered an XXL, but possibly could have went with an XL (I'm 5'4, 36 waist and 40D/DD top). I would have had to wear 3 inch heels with it had I worn it so that it didn't drag, but that would have been perfect for me. Unfortunately my dress did have a small split on the back seam and I didn't notice until it was too late to get it repaired. Overall this dress was well worth the money paid and I will keep this seller bookmarked for future purchases.


I'm 5/4 ,140 pounds and I order the medium size. Didn't expect much for this dress but when I tried it on it was a perfect fit and i got it in 4 days. I'm happy and highly recommended ğŸ˜Š


This is an absolutely gorgeous dress, which I purchased in both the black and the red.  I ended up returning both, as my husband thought the black looked like I was going to a funeral (he was so wrong) and while he loved the red, I felt the red emphasized my abdomen more than the black did.  I felt sexy in the black but frumpy in the red.  I'm only 5'3" and since I wanted to dance, I opted for a shorter dress that wouldn't need altering.  If I'd have kept these, I'm sure I would still have been happy.  They're gorgeous, high quality workmanship, exceptionally comfortable, and don't need ironing at all!  Look great right out of the box (or bag, in this case)!  If you like the look of this, I highly recommend, it's exactly like the photos.  This seems to be a replica of a Kate Middleton dress... there are many other cheap knockoffs of this out there, but this one isn't that.  It's designer inspired, but it's excellent quality!  Regarding sizing... I was between Medium and Large... the Medium fit me better overall, and since I have a short torso, though the large fit my bust better, the large had extra fabric bunching up in the back which was less than flattering as well as it was slightly longer at the feet too.  So if you're in between sizes, consider other factors like height and torso length.  The fabric does stretch and is very forgiving, so I think going the size smaller may be a better bet, unless you're very tall.


I ordered this dress in black, size XL. I have a plus sized hour glass figure and find A lined dresses flatter my body best. This dress is pretty and true to size. However, the diagonal lace trim in the hip area pulled on me making my body look cut off and segmented, instead of long and trimm as pictured. If the dress didn't have the diagonal trim detailing, it would have been perfect for me. The lace trim is sown into the dress, not on it, so it cannot be removed.


Gorgeous dress, but maybe not too flattering for "large" chests. I'm a 36DD(D) and the top parts looks a bit "matronly" (probably because no bra can lift my breasts as high as the women in the picture!). But other than that the quality is great, and I can imagine wearing this dress for a formal event.


I ordered the Miusol Women's Elegant Deep-V Neck Floral Lace Wedding Party Maxi Dress at the same time (same manufacturer, different model, sleeveless), thinking I would keep the one I liked best, but ended up keeping both... I just couldn't return that one!


I'm ordering another one of this model for my mom! The shape and design is very flattering and quite forgiving. Even as an XL, I think this dress will look great!


One a side note: The Miusol Women's Elegant Deep-V Neck Floral Lace Wedding Party Maxi Dress (sleeveless) is much sexier. But both models are surprisingly well made and fit beautifully.


For reference: I'm 5'5", about 130 lbs. and 36DD(D). I ordered the medium and it fits like a glove, although the top is a little bit hard to get into because of the built-in belt (did I mention the large chest?)


I read the amazing reviews and gave it a try. it looked cheap, and the tendency to accumulate static made it look only tackier. The skirt came very long (i'm 5'4). The cut was not particularly flattering. (I saw a ton of reviews from even women in the teens saying this dress fit beautifully) I wear a size 10/12 and have a flatter belly and ordered a large, which was the right size, however those diagonal lines at the hips just did everything wrong for the hips and tummy. It went straight back.


Okay so I love the dress - BUT am returning it and ordering the XL.  I am 5'7" and weigh 135 pounds. After reading many reviews I ordered the Large.  It's a beautiful dress but I have wider shoulders and I had a difficult time actually getting the dress on!  Once I got it over my head and shoulders it fit quite well.  I'm wearing it to an evening wedding with dinner and dancing afterward.  So I want to be comfortable.  It is very flattering for my tall slender frame - makes me look like a have some curves!  The quality seems really good too.  I've never worn an XL in ANYTHING before - but oh well - I don't really care as long as it fits. So you might want to order up a size just to be cautious.


Update:  just received the XL last night and will be keeping it as it's MUCH easier to get on.  It's a bit looser through the body than I like - if there were a zipper in the dress the Large would be perfect for me.  Also the lining of the XL is more of a white.  The lining of the Large is much darker- more of a beige and I actually like it better.  Also you MUST get a can of Static Guard!  Even when you pull it out of the bag it's full of static.  I sprayed the dress completely through the lace as well as right on the lining.  By the way - the dress is made in China- so that's why it runs small!  Can't wait to wear it this Saturday.
