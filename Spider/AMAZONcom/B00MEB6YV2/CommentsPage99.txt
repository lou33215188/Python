This dress is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!! It fit like a glove. Stunning and AMAZING price!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!


It's a beautiful dress, except for the super-clingy lining. Also, it's not floor length at all. More like ankle length and the lining is much shorter than the lace overlay so it looks a bit odd. Overall a nice dress, though...


It's not as pretty in reality as it is in picture, that was very disappointing.


The sash made me give this dress a 4 star. However I can always change that.


Fits great and looks great.


Once again, I must return.  Most of these cheap online dresses run 2 sizes too small...too bad it was lovely.


The dress was pretty, but fit too small.  As a result, I had to send it back. I would recommend ordering a size up from what you normally wear.  Also, the dress was very long even with heels (I am 5'4'' tall).  Overall, I think the dress would have been a good value if it had fit me.


It's very cute for the price. Fits well. I would buy again!


It was a little tight for me! Also shows the shape of your body!


Just order a size up and you will be fine.  Very nice material and finishing


Fits as expected and shows off curves well.  Color is a beautiful deep red!
