beautiful dress, very well made. nice material. it is exactly how pictured.


Nice quality but way too large. Ordered the small, and I normally wear a size 2. This dress was baggy and just wayyyyy too large overall. The fabric quality seems very good and it is a very pretty design. It is just too big.
