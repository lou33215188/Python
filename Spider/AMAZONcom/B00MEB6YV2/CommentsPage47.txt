I love this. The ribbons across the hips does not stretch with the material so you get some bumps. But spanks underneath fixed that. :)


This is a great dress! So pretty and fits great! I have received so many compliments on this dress.


After reading all the positive reviews of this dress, I had high expectations.  I was not dissapointed.  Very nice quality, fit well and very flattering.  Bought it for my daughters October Wedding. She was amazed at the price and I am looking forward to wearing such a comfortable dress for the day.


It didn't work for an hourglass figure....a little too loose under the bustline and upper waist and too snug in the hips.  Very comfortable, but I sent back as it wasn't the right fit for me.


Very nice


Very flattering and comfortable.  I'm a size 18 and bought the 3x.  Fits great.  It's about an inch too long with short heels on but will be easy to hem the extra up under the ribbon.  Awesome dress at an unbelievable price.


My friend loved the material and design of this and a couple dresses, but it didn't quite fit correctly in all the right places. Returns on clothing on Amazon are a must when shopping, and it came in handy. She was sad to send it back.


This dress was all that I expected after reading the reviews. I ordered a 2XL, though I am usually a XL (190 pds/5'3). The dress fit well,  I could have worn the XL, but better safe than sorry! I wore the dress to our company holiday party---everyone raved! It will fit your body just as the picture shows. Great quality! To give you an idea of me I usually shop Gap, Loft, Ann Taylor, Nordstroms.


I was looking for a lace dress and this one was PERFECT! AWESOME! Everyone commented on this dress and for the price it was well worth it. Not as long as I'd like it to be but overall good buy


Nice dress I did not care for all the lace once I had it on. I returned it, Nice tho.
