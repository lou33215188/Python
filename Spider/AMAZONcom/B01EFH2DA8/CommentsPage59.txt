Comfortable and flattering fit. My middle school students said "Miss you are slaying today"...meaning that I looked good.  High praise indeed, lol.


looks great on my wife


didnt' look good on me


The dress is very hugging. I was expecting a different material as well. The material was like swimsuit. The color is great and i'm hoping I don't sweat too much in this dress.


Ordered this in two colors. Great fit. Unbelievable quality for the price. Cute Cute Cute


This dress is perfect and so comfortable. I'm a size 6, 5'4, 135lbs and ordered a Medium. It fits perfectly in the chest and waist and flares at the hips. It comes slightly below my knees. Definitely ordering in more colors!


I have gotten a lot of compliments in this dress, I love the color on me and it lays nicely on me


Perfect fit. Looks nice. Material a bit rough though. But will buy again


very nice dress sort of a t-shirt fabric.  Length hits right about knee on me and I'm 5'6".  Very comfortable dress.  Casual.


T-shirt material and too large.
