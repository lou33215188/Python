I absolutely love it! The sizes fit well and the dress is perfect for all occassions. It is a thicker fabric and is very stretchy as well.


This was comfy and I got a lot of compliments on it.


Fun simple dress for the money!


This is now my go to little black "oh ya" dress.  Gonna be a walk of shame tomorrow.


I did not like the dress. The dress didnâ€™t look like what was advertised.


Very pleased with this dress.  Will be buying more.


Pretty dress, fits well but was disappointed as to how wrinkled it came.


Had to return it due to the dress not fitting properly at the chest. It was too late to get a new one for my event. Very pretty thout


The dress fits as expected.  It is an easy to throw on summer outfit.


I expected better fabric.  Rather disappointed in quality.
