I love this dress!  Super cute.


Just what I was looking for


I was looking for a travel dress. This dress arrived out of the package extremly wrinkled, so it's not going to work for traveling in my suitcase.


Love how comfy this is. Material feels thick and durable but its not too hot to wear. Easy to nurse my son and very modest-my boobs arent hanging out of the dress


My wife was excited when she received the gift and was elegant.


Nice fit, flattering dress.


Love this dress so much but the color isn’t what I expected. I ordered the multicolored black and in the picture the skirt looks black but it’s definitely blue. I haven’t decided if I will return or not because the dress fits amazing.


a gift


The material is thicker than I expected but overall it seems like it's going to be great.


I ordered a size too big, so I am returning for a smaller size. I am 5'5 and around 175lbs and ordered an XL in the light blue. I have a large bottom half so I feel as if it is hard to find a flattering dress. This one will be perfect when I get the right size!
