Fits great, very comfortable and modest. Material is sturdy but soft with some stretch. Washes well.


Not as elegant as I imagined, more casual


Love the lines of the dress, fabric could be softer.


I like it, nothing special, but a good comfortable everyday dress. Nice coverage for larger chested women without wearing a turtleneck.


Adorable summer dress.  It's held up to a couple washes with out fading.


Great material, great fit and color! Will be buying more in other colors for sure :)


I love this dress!


Fits well. Cute and casual.
