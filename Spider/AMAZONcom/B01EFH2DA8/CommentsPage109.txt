Cute dress, fits nicely.


My wife was very happy with this dress. She ordered a medium and it fit her perfectly with good length since she is tall.


a little  big in the top/ chest region causing it to look wrinkled and not even to one side


This dress is super cute, flirty and sexy. It is a great fabric and doesn't wrinkle easily.


Great little dress for work or play!


Great dress!  Cool material that fits well and looks very flattering on a variety of body types.


Very nice fit and style.  Downsides: no pockets, and wish it came in a little longer also.  Overall, a really good buy.
