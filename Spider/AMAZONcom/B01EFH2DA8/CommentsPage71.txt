LOVE this dress, I bought  a second on in light blue color. Fits perfectly. I my measurements. Soft fabric, washes well. Modest & very comfortable.


Amazing little dress for the price. I don't know how it'll hold up over time, but it seems to be decent quality cotton and has a flow. Fits as expected.


The item is toooo expensive for the quality of the item, and fits small, i am not happy to have purchase, i have had better quality items for cheaper price!


fits perfectly, very comfortable.  love it


This dress fits too big through my chest and fits well if I wear a good padded bra.  It did fit great through my waist and hip area.  I ordered a medium because reviews on Amazon stated it ran small.  The color is great.  The fabric is so soft.  It could be a dress I can dress up for work or an afternoon lunch with friends.


Pretty dress, will buy it in other colors


The customer service with Laksmi is amazing. I had an issue due to my mismeasurement and they went above and beyond to make sure I was happy. This dress is a really pretty blue too. I recommend them for online shopping for clothing. I will be shopping with them again in the future.
