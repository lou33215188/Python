I like this dress, dress is comfortable and color is true , just as described.


Gorgeous! Just the right length. Material is very nice.


Fit wonderfully. Covered everything i wanted. Very Flattering on my 5' 175lbs frame.


The sewing quality isn't great, thus 4 stars. But the cut and fit are cute. It was a tad big on me, so I added a belt. I would recommend it!

It is truly a Casual Dress. Work/Office appropriate. Material on the higher end of Tshirt type knit.
