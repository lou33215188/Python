I tried the dress on when it arrived and it fits like a glove and the color is perfect. It was a little hard to get all the wrinkles out of from shipping and I haven't worn it yet but look forward to.


I bought this dress and the black version. Odd thing is the black one was tight along the belly, as if the A line cut was too long in the top. However, this one fit perfect. Wore it for a Florida beach wedding. Light, comfortable.


Love this dress . Don't put in the dryer hang dry it .


It's very comfy


It is a very nice casual dress, and is very flattering and, indeed, comfortable.  Also easy to take care of--wash and wear; no ironing.


Nice simple dress. Fits true to size.


Comfortable dress, I am 5'5 and 180 lbs and it hits just below my knee. I don't like short dresses and this is the perfect summer dress for work.


Great price and comfortable fit.  I don't know yet how it will wear


Love this dress! Received one in black for Christmas and loved it so much, I had to get another. Comfortable. Stretches in all the right ways.


Yes I'm crazy. I bought a dress for my wife online for Mother's Day. She rolled her eyes and said she would never buy  clothes online but when she tried it on and it fit perfectly she said. I don't know if this is a score for me or for Amazons sizing.


Comfy and fits just right. I purchased a small and I’m 5’1 and 135lbs. The sleeves are a little short but overall I love this dress.
