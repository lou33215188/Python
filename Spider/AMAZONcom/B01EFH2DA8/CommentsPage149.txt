Medium fit perfectly (32" bra line/35" bust, 5'3", 121#). It was comfortable and form fitted without being skin tight. Nice thick and soft fabric.


Such a well-made, beautiful dress!! So comfortable and flattering!


Great dress that I can dress up or dress down.  I am 5 7, 150lbs and the medium fits great.  Very happy with the dress!
