Adorable dress and a good length. Quality is much better than I expected. I definitely recommend it!


This is a very cute dress.  I chose the size based on the measurements in the product description, but it still seems large in the waist.  I prefer a more form-fitting dress, but it will do.


Simply put, very pretty dress that fit well for a great price.


Great dress for the price.  Fit perfect nice material


My husband was fliored and he exclaimed that it fit like it was made for me. Very flattering style.


Was complimented the entire day that I wore it!!!


It fit as expected, I'm 5'4"and approx. 170, with a 38DDD bra size. I bought XL and it fit great, I lice it and plan on ordering another.


Very comfy. The color is beautiful. Fit a bit big on the bust.


I loved everything about this dress! It just didn't make me look good. Love the fabric. It is soft and comfortable. I just hate that I am returning it. It is nicely made.


My wife is slender and it was little big in the top but the waist and length were good. Color is nice. Material is soft.
