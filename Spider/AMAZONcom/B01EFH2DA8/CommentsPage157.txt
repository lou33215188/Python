I ordered this dress on a whim thinking it would be nice for auditions. It fit me perfectly (size M). It's easy to move in and long enough to wear spanx underneath. It's modest and I don't have to worry about being exposed in any area of worry. The material is comfortable and the length is nice. I plan on ordering more in different colors!


This is a super cute dress. It looks amazing on my wife and she loves it. It was a little too small so I would recommend getting a size bigger.


Got this dress for my wife in two colors, if fits as expected and looks fantastic, great for work or a night out.


Nice material


I love the twist at the top (whatever it's called), and I like the length of the dress, as well as the flowers. It is very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this dress


Like this dress! It's a surprisingly comfortable fit. The fabric is super stretchy so it clings a bit around the chest and waist. I'm 5'4", pear shape (bottom heavy) and usually wear a 10 or 12 in my bottom half and an 8 in my top. I have a hard time getting dresses to fit both top and bottom. I ordered the large and it fit. The stretchy fabric would probably allow me to wear a medium but I don't like clothes as clingy as some.  All in all it's a great dress. The only downside is that the fabric wrinkles badly from being shipped.


I am 5 foot four and weighs 110 pounds and a size small is huge on me.


Itâ€™s too loose around my waist even though I got the right size but the problem was easily fixed with an elastic belt meant for dresses. Really nice material and perfect for Florida heat.


I love the dress; I always order large, but it's a little snug.  I will return and get the Xlarge because  I really do like the dress.


This is a great dress that can be used for work or fun. Its extremely comfortable and is very flattering. I would buy in all colors.
