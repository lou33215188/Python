Dress fits nice in the right places and doesn't bunch.  Glad I bought it and works well for work, transitioning well for an evening out.


Love it- the dress is comfortable and stylish - fits like a glove :)


it fits so well on me


For the price this is a great dress!  For me, it fit as expected and the material is stretchy and solidly sewn together.  I would definitely buy from this company again.


Fits like a glove. With just a bit of flare from the waist down, hides any problem areas I have.


Very very comfy but also stylish looking.


I love this dress! It's very flattering and fits just right. The movement of the skirt is a lot of fun, and I love the variety of colors and patterns available.


This is a great by, i am 5'7 and 150 lbs. I bought a med fits great, very flattering!


Good value for a nice dress.


Purchased for my daughter.  Fitted as it should.


Can't beat the dress for the price. Love it
