love this dress


Love it.  Looks great on me.


I gave it 5 star, and I mean Im getting other colors! I usually hate taking photos of myself cuz I feel fat after having a baby, but this is too gorgeous and made me take more photos of myself!


The dress looks nice, the fabric is a light tee-shirt material which makes it super easy to wear and it looks great on.


got a lot of compliments


Love these dresses fitbis perfect


Love my little maroon dress. It is a very flattering style and very comfortable.


Very pretty!! Thank you!


It's cheap, and you get what you pay for. Doesn't hang very well, but again, it's cheap!


Beautiful color and perfect fit. Stretchy material and hides all the right areas. Iâ€™m 5,7 and weigh 170 with DD breast size. Large is perfect!
