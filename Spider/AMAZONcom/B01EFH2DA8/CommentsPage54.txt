So happy I purchased this dress.. Looks great size is just right.  lots of complements.


I am wearing this dress right now. And just went online and bought two more! I love it and the fit, comfort and price. I live in a desert, so this will be perfect for my summers at the office, at the movies with my husband, or a weekend party.


Not for short, busty girls. I'm 5'2" and a G cup. The bodice is too long and way too tight across my chest. Will fit average proportions better. Fabric is a little cheap, but seems reasonable for the price.


I loved the look and feel of this dress.


Fits great. I love the cut of this dress


Dress is gorgeous and super soft. Was exactly as described and fits perfectly.


Very cute dress for any occasion... dress it up or keep it simple.  Fits great and made well!


Nice dress for the price. Fit is true  to sizing. Material is nice


I love this dress. I'm ordering another one.


xxl is not 18-20, wrinkles from shipping package seem permanent
