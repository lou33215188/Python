It was fine for the price but I didn't love it so I returned it.


I took a chance and purchased this dress (Laksmi women's v-neck urban) based on positive reviews. Here is my own positive review! The size, shape, and detailing of the dress is just gorgeous. My biggest concern was the fabric thickness, not wanting it to be flimsy like a super-thin T-shirt. I am happy to report that the fabric has some substance to it. I am 5'5 and 160 (41" bust) and the fit of the XL is exactly perfect. It is not snug around my rib cage, but its flattering waist and a loose fit for summer coolness makes that perfectly fine with me. Great dress. I'm very glad I found it.
