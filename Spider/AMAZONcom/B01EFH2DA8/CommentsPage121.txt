The color (blue) was vivid and rich just as the photo.  It was pretty wrinkled but after washing and hanging to dry it looked great.


Wow. Just wow. This dress fits me perfectly and is very flattering to the figure. Casual. Dressed-up. Comfy around the house (no joke).  It is very versatile and can be made to look/feel however you choose.  It's very comfortable and I can see myself relaxing with my family on the couch or putting on some heels and jewelry and going out, while wearing this dress. I got this as a lightening deal but would buy again full price. This is a quality product. I chose the color purple, which is branching out for me because full-on purple tends to remind me of Barney (not the look I'm ever going for). But to my surprise, it just looks elegant and sleek and feels so comfy.  I followed the measuring chart and it runs true-to-fit. Now, to browse the other colors.....


I love it! Unfortunately, it was a smidge smaller than I like, so I'm returning to buy it a size up.


What a cute summer dress! Can be dressed up or dressed down.


Great fit and style. This dress is super comfortable and I love the way it looks on me.


Fits just as I wanted.  It was wrinkled when I got it, but I just hung it up for a couple of days and it was perfect!


I like this dress, but little long have to get hemmed up. I'm 5"1 and it goes pass my knees. Other then that really like.


My Mom looked amazing in this wish I bought it for myself.


Great fit and she hates dresses but loved this one. To help us guys out she is 5'4 and 150 medium fit great.....


Very flattering, got a lot of complements when I wore it.
