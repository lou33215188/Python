I picked this up because I needed a work dress, and I figured it couldn't hurt to try this one. It was a little loose(I'm 5'8" and 135 pounds and ordered a medium), but not so much that I couldn't put a belt on it and work it. It was right at knee-length, which is a rarity for women of my height. Would definitely recommend it to everyone!


Love this dress.
