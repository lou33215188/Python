Beautiful, and true to size, I now have pink and blue.


This fits really well, is comfortable and flattering.  The color is true to the picture.  A great casual summer dress that can also be accessorized to be a bit more formal.  Versatile.


I like this dress.  Cute and comfy.  Fit is right.


So stunning and fits perfect!


The criss-cross fits a bit weirdly on my bust, but the length is great, and the capped sleeves are super comfy.


Great quality, flattering fit!!


Fit is great, but color is distorted and not as pictured. What was supposed to be a black floral print skirt is actually a grey/blue floral print. Noticeably different, like two different styles sewn together.


Great dress for all day & especially nursing!


Very nice dress. I purchased it for my son's wedding rehearsal dinner. I needed something that could be dressed up or down. Very flattering to less than perfect bodies.


Ok
