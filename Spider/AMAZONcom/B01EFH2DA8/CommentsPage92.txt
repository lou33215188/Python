I love it and will give as a gift.


Ordered the small and got a lot of compliments. I ordered the same dress in a different color - very easy to dress up or dress down depending on the event. Fits nice and looks well made.


What a great find! Great fit and value!


I am 5’5” and 160. The large fit great. Perfect for the office.


Very cute and flattering dress!!  It's not tight as described.  I'm 5'4 and it hit my knee.  I hope wanted it a little shorter so I took it to be hemmed.  I would buy again and plan to purchase another dress from this manufacturer in a different style too.


This dress is so comfortable. Love it


The dress is nice but the skirt is definitely a feathered BLUE not black.


Live this dress.  Very slimming.


Love it. It's a simple classic dress. Great fit, super comfy breathable material. Appropriate for work or leisure.


Well made, fits as described, and comfortable dress. I would buy again. Highly recommend.
