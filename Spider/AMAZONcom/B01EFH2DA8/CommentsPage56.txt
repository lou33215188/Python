I love this dress! Very flattering! I will be buying another in a different color!


Nice and cute basic summer dress


Good quality material.  Form flattering.  Looks great!


5'4" and wear a 34B and have a 30inch waist - the material was surprisingly good - not thin and flimsy feeling at all.  These wrap style dresses are just always hit or miss - sometimes that diagonal seam hits your boobs right and sometimes it doesn't. This time, it didn't.


I love this dress. The fit is perfect, it's comfortable and can be worn for a nice date or during the progressional day with a change of shoes. I want one in every color. Even in the hot Florida weather it stays cool and comfortable. It washes and dries well. It's everything I want in a dress.


The material is somewhat thicker than I expected but it looks nice. Definitely looks somewhat casual.


Will be fine for special events.


Flattering style at a great price.  Very pleased.


I love the fit of this dress. I ordered it in black and gray after wearing the purple.


Cute dress but runs small to measurements.
