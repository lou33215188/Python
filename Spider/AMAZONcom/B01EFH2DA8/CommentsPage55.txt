Really nice dress. Fits really nice and the fabric is good quality.


I like it...its a little thinner fabric than I wanted which is just a personal preference. It isn't see through though.


Great quality just should have order next biggest size. Fabulous color!


This dress looks great on me. Very different color then I would normally buy but I wanted to try something different with a style dress I enjoy. Wear it for work and looks great!!


Gorgeous color, good quality material. Definitely going to look at getting additional dresses in different colors. Great for work or casual, and could be dressed up for going out.


This is cute and comfortable. I am 5'7" and about 130 lbs and a medium fits me reasonably well. The skirt is about to my knees.


My husband said it looks like a maternity dress.


I love this dress. So far I ‘be only worn it once, but I received lots of compliments. It’s simple enough to dress down or you can dress it up with a few accessories. This dress is very flattering for the fuller figured woman too.


Perfect dress!  Fabric is substantial and breathable.  It is a little stretchy so cleavage is not a problem.  I am 5'6", 130 lb and small chested.  I ordered a small and it fit perfectly.  If I had more reasons to wear a dress I would buy one in every color.  High quality, worth every penny!


I bought the blue first, and it fit so well I went back to purchase the black and merlot colored dresses.  It is a flattering fit, fits well over the bust without a lot of cleavage, and it does not shift during the day, so I am able to comfortably wear it to work with a jacket or sweater, alone at night for more of an evening look.
