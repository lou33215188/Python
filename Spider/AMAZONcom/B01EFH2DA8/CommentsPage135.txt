I bought the dress for my daughter and she is very happy with it.


Simply elegant and comfortable. A steal at the price.


Love this dress!  Bought it for my 15 year old to wear for Thanksgiving.  Fit her modestly and looked so feminine.  The material is a nice, stretchy knit, so it fit like a comfy t-shirt.  I have washed it, and it survived quite well.  The price was reasonable, and I would definitely recommend this dress. ğŸ˜„
