For $20 I'm super pleased with how this dress looks. It's cute and can be dressed up or dressed down. It smells super funky but I'm hoping that goes away after it's washed. Plus it's nursing friendly (mostly on one side, but still!)


matrerial looks dull, not classy...


Super comfortable and lightweight. Very flattering and pretty dress. I love it! I'll be buying in more colors for sure.


Very pretty color


I have bought this in three colors, I love it and the XML is so flattering


I like this dress. Fits me great and I have a wide bottom and small top.


Not as flattering as shown.


Decent but not the best for a tall person.


Very beautiful dress, I wear an h cup bra and the xl fit me amazingly with plenty of room and no tightness. I completely recommend this dress for busty girls like me!


Looove it!
