I'm looking forward to wearing this on Christmas Day!


I bought this dress and lost the order information. I ended up giving it away to the Salvation Army donation. Tissue paper thin, too small,


Not true to color ,looks faded,, material and fit not good at all. I was looking forward to getting the dress but very disappointed and have to return it.


The top is black the skirt is navy, I would like to exchange this for another color.


Beautiful dress, and it fits as expected. I ordered the people floral one and had so many compliments!


At 5 2' it went over my knees. Small was too big and baggy for me. Would fit a taller person nicely.


To the manufacturers.....Will you please make in NAVY BLUE?? Thank you!!


I love this dress, fits great,  comfortable and easy to wash! I will buy it again in another color.


Nice dress


This was given as a gift for Easter and fit beautifully. It was a perfect style and color for a lovely young lady and the dress was of good quality and color.
