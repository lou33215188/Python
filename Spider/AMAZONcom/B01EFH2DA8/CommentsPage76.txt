I love the flow of this dress, it's very flattering. It fits a little large but, not so large that I can't wear it.


I bought this dress to wear to work and be able to pump without taking all my clothes off. I love it! Super comfy, looks good, fits well. Easy to pump and nurse in.


Pretty dress. Nice amount of stretch to the fabric. Cute. Good price.


I got this dress in the orange and it's a really nice color. The fit is very flattering and although I'm 5'2" it's not too long. Comfortable fabric that has a nice stretch to it. I'm sure I'll be wearing this for a lot of different occasions since it can be dressed up or down.


bit small in the bust - but I love it


adorable fit!! comfy


Slightly big according to sizing chart, but overall very flattering. I haven't laundered this item yet, so if anything goes wrong with that, I'll revise my rating. For now, I have a feeling I'll be ordering this dress in several different colors because it is so comfortable and affordable.


Very nice dress for the price.  I thought it fit as expected, it washes nicely and maintains it size/shape.


Nice. I wish it would be longer to cover my knees.


Beautiful dress. Fit perfectly. I love this dress.
