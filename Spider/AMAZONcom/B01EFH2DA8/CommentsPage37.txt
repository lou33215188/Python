Good design and the size fits well with me. Weather is still cold so donâ€™t have a chance to wear it out.  Looks fine. Thanks.


Super cute and modest dress I can wear for any occasion! I bought my usual size, small, and it fits perfectly. I am 5'3" and 120 lbs.


Cute dress at a good price. Fits well. Usually wear a 6 and the small fit perfectly.


Beautiful soft fabric, beautiful dress. Follow THE VENDOR"S size measurements. I'm a small-medium and ordered a large - fits perfect!


I get compliments every time I wear this dress. It's the most comfortable dress I own. I love that I can wear it for casual or to work.  I should have ordered one in every color.


This dress is great for traveling...it fits as expected and not too tight


I am 5.5, 131 lbs, 32DD, athletic build, and a medium is is just a shade big. But I think a small would be too small so I'll keep it, and just be extra comfortable. Maybe it will be my Eating Dress, when I go out to restaurants or whatever. It is lightweight but not too thin and not see through. Perfect for summer. The light blue is lovely, such a fresh color (I usually wear only black and gray :))


This dress is super comfortable. Perfect for a summer day. I got a black and red one and I love both of them.


Love the dress!  Material is heavier.  I ordered a medium, but I think the small would have been a better fit.


The material is very nice, stretchy but not thin. Very flattering cut- perfect casual summer dress that could be dressed up easily with heels and jewelry. I am a solid size 16 dress and pants and the XXL fits very comfortably. The length is right below the knee which is very flattering for me. Highly recommend! Going to order some other colors.
