This is a gorgeous dress and fits like a dream.  It's kind of retro, but the full skirt is great for dancing!  The crisscross bodice is perfect, lending form without showing tons of cleavage.  Love the saturated color!


This dress is lovely. It fits me well and if you feel it's covering you up too much you can pull the front down to let your chest sit more at the top of the dress.


This dress is perfect! I've purchased a total of 5 of them. A few for myself & some to give as gifts. New favorite dress!


This dress is very comfortable and washed easily. My only complaint is that the cross over seams hit my breast in a very unflattering place. Trying to pull the fabric up or down to adjust it doesnâ€™t really look any better.


Fits great! I'm a 16-18 and ordered an XL. I'm very pleased. Hard to find dresses that fit my top.


Love this dress.  I get compliments every time I wear it!!!


I am a size 14, ordered a XL, and it is way too tight.  UPDATE:  I was able to get an XXL from the company and the fit was much better.


A classic dress for my classy gal.  A great purchase.


I liked it but not everything fits everyone


My mother loves it! She is roughly 170lbs to 180lbs, 5'3 1/2", we got a large and it fits perfectly.
