Beautiful dress, fits well, very comfortable.


So cute and comfy.  I wear a 14 to 16 and the X-L fit perfectly.  I may get more colors


Comfortable, beautiful dress!  You'd never know it was so affordable.


Love the color and it fit's my voluptuous shape perfect.  Husband loves it.


Really nice dress. Fit true to size. I received a lot of compliments.


Have only tried it on but it's super comfortable and fits great! I'm looking forward to wearing this a lot this summer. I started at 4 stars because I can't speak to how it will hold up in the long run or even how it launders at this point. But very hopeful!!


Too snug for an XL which I normally wear.


Soft fabric, almost couldn’t believe it’s from china


I would not buy this again


Easy to wear, easy to care for, easy to dress up or down.  This is the perfect dress!
