Love this dress! I wish it had pockets, but I still love wearing it. Fit & color are exactly as I expected (I bought a large instead of a medium expecting it to run small- the large is perfect)


Decent work dress - I don't love it, and I don't hate it.


This dress looks great!! It was a great fit and flattering! The color is rich and beautiful! But I had to remove a star because it shrunk in the wash. So it might be good to order a size up.


Great buy. Fits perfect and hangs nice. Covers bust good without you falling out. I'm 5'8 , 155# and ordered the large. I'm normally a medium but thought I'd best get a large. I've bought other things on.Amazon and they  tend to run small. Very much worth the it. I'm going to order another.


Very flattering! Fits as expected, lovely blue colour. Love it.


Pretty tight on top and it seemed to run higher waisted than expected.


Really nice dress. I'm 5'2, 150#, wear a 12 on bottom, and the large fit well.


Comfortable, nursable and looks decent. The length is nice and the sleeves are perfect little cap sleeves.


Very comfortable. Well made. Fit perfectly! Very fun dress to wear! You can dress it up or down easily with accessories.  I'm going to order another color!


A really pretty dress and appears well made.
