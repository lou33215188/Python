The dress fits wonderfully and it’s comfortable. I’m a little bummed about the color, the color in the pictures makes it look like a royal blue color. The color of the dress I received is almost a faded royal blue, almost Greyish blue.


I doubt I could get my wife to model a photo for Amazon but oh man you should see her in it. This dress is perfect.


I read some of the review first, I am 5"1 and 136 lbs. It fits me well.  The quality of the cloth is good and thick, so don't need to worry about the wrinkles.


I got one of these months ago and I'm back today to get more! Very comfortable (though I did alter mine with a quick stitch to close the front because I'm rather modest) and easy to care for and it's held up to heavy use!


very disappointed I really liked this style but was too high waisted and too small for an XL dress/


Got it for my mother in law. She is 6'1" and it fell in a flattering spot. Not too short  like some of her other dresses I also wore it and I'm 4'11 and it look good not too long. The fit is great.


Cute dress the quality of the material is good it's not see-through. The color is really nice. I have the blue. True to size.


Fits curves without hugging too snugly


I wear dresses every day for work. This one is a favorite. Classic, will never go out of style. Comfy and thicker material. Very forgiving with "chesticles" and pooch.....what could be nicer?


This dress is so versatile!  It looks great as is, but can be "dressed up" with accessories.  Will be ordering more items from this company.
