Fits just right and can be dressy or casual.


Fits well and is breastfeeding friendly


Arrived on time. My dress had a bit of a stain, so it definitely had to be washed before use. Afterwords it was clean, it fits great hugging the body at the right places.


The shaping is just a bit awkward. Not quite what I expected based upon the photo.


Very cute dress. It's a little longer than I thought but very cute.  I will probably buy another one in another color ğŸ˜€


Love!  And there is plenty of room on the bottom to fit most shapes


Love


I was skeptical as Iâ€™ve never bought clothes on Amazon before. But, this is really a great dress. It fits true to size and the length is perfect (Iâ€™m 5â€™9â€�). The material is soft and it seems well made. As a bonus, itâ€™s great for nursing!


Fit my 5' 1", 35C girlfriend to a tee. She loved it


My dress arrived today and it's what I have been looking for! Material is of good quality. Extremely pleased. Need to get  another one with different pattern. I'm 5'3 ft. 126 pounds. I picked a size  small.
