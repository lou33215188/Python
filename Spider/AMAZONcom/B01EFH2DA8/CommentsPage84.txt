Beautiful dress very flattering!!! Love it!!! Thank you


This dress is so flattering! It is the perfect black dress for work or a night out. The fabric is soft and forgiving. So glad u bought this!


I sadly bought this dress for my Grandma's funeral. It's a nice simple black dress and I'll wear it again in the future.


Ohmigosh this is a FANTASTIC dress! It is simple and stylish, and fits beautifully.  I am 5'7", 180 lbs, am not large busted. This dress immediately takes 15 pounds off my appearance.The XL is snug in all the right places and looks like a million bucks. The top fits me perfectly, but a larger busted woman would do just fine, since there's plenty of room to stretch.


The fabric is a stretchy cotton that did not arrive wrinkled. I put it on right out of the box, and voila - instant gorgeous! It doesn't seem like it would badly wrinkle, unlike customer photos I've seen. The fabric has a classy feel to it, with a spandex oomph. The maroon color I bought is true to the photo.


At the same time I bought this, I also bought a "Sue&Joe Women's Fit and Flare Dress V-neck Ruched Flowy Pleated Cap Sleeve Dress" which is just okay by comparison, but this Lakshmi is so much nicer.


I love this dress so much I'm going to order it in another color. I never thought I'd swoon over a mail order clothing purchase, but if I could give this six stars I would.


This dress is flattering and size small fits perfectly (5'5", 136#)


Very nice quality dress for the price.  The top of the dress is very flattering.  The only issue is the dress is a little longer then I normally like.  I am 5'1" and the size small came down past my knees.


Classic and comfy.  Fit exactly as I expected it to.


Loved the color and the fit!


Love this dress, should order a couple other colors.


I love this dress bu it was too big for me.  I'm a size 12 and purchase XL.  I gave to a friend instead of returning.
