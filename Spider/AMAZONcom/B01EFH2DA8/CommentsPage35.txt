Great color and fabric. It fit well and because of my tummy it held that in. I will probably buy more dresses from this  vendor. I received the dress as expected. Great product.


Cute for when you want to be a little dressier nursing (works great for nursing) but not so fancy that you feel over dressed or worry that you got spit up or milk on ğŸ˜‚


Beautiful dress, great deep red color,  It does run a bit big in the waist.  I'll have to have it altered.  Also, the fabric is a good weight and moves beautifully.


l ve the color and the length. I would recommend sizing down


Little black dress at its finest! Easy to wear to work and to dinner. It only needs accessories because itâ€™s so dark. Love it


Awesome material, not see through at all. I bought the longer length dress. I'm about 5'4-5'5 and it sits just below my knees. It was my fault about the sizing though,  I ordered a medium but I could of gotten a small for a more tight look to it.


Many compliments every time I wear it.  Fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable.  I have two and plan on ordering more.


Beautiful dress!  The fabric is perfect-not too light or heavy.  I love the burgundy color.  Wrap dresses are the best.


I ordered the wine red dress in size XL and it fits like it was made just for me!  I love it!  Beautiful dress!  The material is light enough to breathe, but heavy enough not to need a slip underneath.


Love this dress!! Definitely helps the hourglass figure. The color was great and doesn't fade, it doesn't really wrinkle easily cause the material is really soft and a little thicker, and it's a great dress when you have to look nice in a short notice.
