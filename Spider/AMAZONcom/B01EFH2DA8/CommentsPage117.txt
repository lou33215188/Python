Simple black dress just what I was looking for!


I love this dress.  Its so cute on and I am probably going to order it in more colors.


I purchased this dress in grey and a medium.  I'm 5'4", 34 bust, and about 150 pounds with a long waist. Often crossover dresses like this gap a little at the bust on me, but this one fits perfectly everywhere. It hits me right at my knees. Can pull the neckline down for a more modern, revealing bust line or up a little for a more modest look. (I work in a church, so I pull it up to be more modest during the day and down later for a dinner date). It's casual enough for a brunch or afternoon date, but can be dressed up a bit for work or an evening date.  I don't think it would make a good formal dress. But I wanted something more casual and got exactly what I wanted. I'd like to get it in a few more colors. The medium seems to be limited in its colors currently, so I'll wait a bit in the hopes that will change.


Fit as exspected.


Wrines easily but very cute, good fit.


I can't say enough of good things about this dress. I need one in every color now. ğŸ˜�


This dress is super cute! It car fairlh quickly and is good quality. I'm usually a size large but after reading reviews I went with an extra large and it fits very well. I'm happy!
