Beautiful and very flattering. 5'5", 165 lb, 34DD Large fit perfectly. Well worth it!!


My wife looks awsome in her dress, would recommend to anyone looking for a simple but classy dress


Love it!  Well made and fits perfectly.  Wrap type top fits snugly as shown and doesn't fall open.  I'm very pleased and am considering purchasing in another color.


I LOVE these dresses! I have 4 different colors and they flatter my less than flattering curves lol! LOVE THESE


I am usually pretty suspicious of buying clothes of Amazon, but after reading the reviews, I decided to try it out. This is beautiful and a great fit! Would definitely buy again!


Cute dress, fits perfectly. I usually wear medium and I ordered a medium and its perfect.


Obviously not made with American body types in mind. I really love the dress and get many compliments but Iâ€™m always tugging it down as the torso is too short for me. Made in China for smaller sized bodies.


Very comfortable and nice fit with stylish design.


I'm 5'7 214 pds chubby woman. Mostly belly. I ordered a large. Perfect fit. Comes to my knees. Perfect.


The material was nice, it hung nicely and was flattering but larger than I expected it to be.
