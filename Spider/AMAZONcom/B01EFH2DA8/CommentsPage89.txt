Love these dresses for work; have one in most colors. Washes great, comfortable, and can dress them up with earrings and necklace nicely. Very happy with these buys, however would recommend sizing up to avoid a very fitted look.


Love this dress--very flattering and comfy. Only criticism is that I wish it had pockets! I got one in black and loved it so much bought a second.


Material is heavier than I thought it would be. If you are self conscious about your hips, stay away.


Beautiful and well-made.


Great dress!!  Fun


This dress is just darling and fits perfectly. I'm 5' 5" and 130 lbs...the small fit best, though the medium wasn't too loose either.


Perfect. The only issue I have is that the top part of the dress kind of slides and shows more cleavage than I'd like. But it's still beautiful.


Very comfortable


Very nice dress. Soft fabric.


I ordered the cranberry dress in a medium and loved the flattering fit and beautiful color. The ruching however was not flattering on me (I wear a size 34B), so I returned the dress.
