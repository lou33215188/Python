Dress fits perfect and very cute. I'm 5'9'' and 165 lbs and the medium fit perfectly.


This is such a nice dress! Flattering fit, nice fabric weight, and a really pretty color.


Fits perfect a little thin but is ok for work I will order another color.


This dress is great. When I purchased it I thought it was more formal (hence the 4 stars), but it is really more causal.


Great for work.  Washes and wears very well.


Fit great though long, that's expected as I am not quite 5ft! Will see if it can be hemmed some. I wear a petite medium normally and this was perfect on the top!


perfect


i am 5'5 and 140lb so i ordered Small which is a bit small for me. But it is ok, i am working on lose 10 lb this summer. hope it will fit me then.


This dress is comfortable and easy to take care of. The shade of purple is perfect and I plan to buy more!


Very comfortable and nice fabric


Fits perfectly .
