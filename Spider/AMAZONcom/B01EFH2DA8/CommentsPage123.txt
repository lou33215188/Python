Horrible! I received the wrong item AND the sizing chart is way off!


So comfortable and flattering! I'm getting it in many colors!


Nice swing- good fit!


Cancelled my shop dresses! These were a lot less expensive and great quality!!!!!


I really loved my Amazon dresses ğŸ˜Šand delivery was exceptional.


Looks nice for either casual or nicer occasions. 5'2 and it goes just below my knees which is nice.


Everyone at church loved this dress and the silhouette it gave me. I'm very pleased.


Loved it so much I ordered one in a different color!


Fits great, super comfy.  I'm seriously considering buying it in a few more colors.  I'm a size 16 and the xl fits perfectly.


5 foot 1, 119 lbs medium was perfect , classy dress
