Stretchy and very comfortable! I purchased the size large. I'm 5'6", and size 12/14. If fit perfectly!


This dress is awesome! Fit's perfectly and just above the knee which to me is most attractive. Comfortable and looks great!


Nice dress!!  The color is a little more muted/fabric duller than I expected.  Fits well!


Not at all flattering. The image make it look like the bunched fabric would sit below your chest, creating a nice waistline illusion. Instead it sits way too high up on your chest. Also material is cheap, feels like if I washed it once it would fall apart. Was hoping for a cute work appropriate dress :(


I'm 6 months pregnant, and ordered a small, thinking that if it was too tight I could just save it until after I have my baby. This dress was HUGE. Fit like an extra large. Was too big everywhere, was practically falling off of me. I was so excited about this dress and it was definitely very disappointing. I read so many reviews thinking it would be a decent fit, but it wasn't even close.


Love this dress. I wore it to a summer wedding and dressed it up with accessories.  It fit perfectly, and I got a lot of compliments.


I really do like this dress but without an iron, it's been tough keeping it wrinkle free. I'm planning to get one soon. I'm 5'2 and roughly 120lbs, and it fit well enough, though a little loose in the bosom are; I'm a 34C. Nothing unmanageable though.


I would have given a rating of five if it was cotton, but it's rayon.  Also, a medium is a little big for 5'5" 115 pounds.  I did follow the measurements... style is nice and will probably keep it.


Fit was very nice, but fabric was itchy. I did return this item though easily.


My daughter really likes this dress.  It fits well and looks great.
