Wife enjoyed it.


Great dress that shows your curves.


This dress is really cute.  I bought it as a nursing friendly dress and I think it would have worked, had it fit me.  Soft cotton, cute cap sleeve.  The waist is cut a little above my natural waist but I have a long torso. It fit a little too large so I had to return.  I would return for a small but it is not listed as available--not giving 5 stars since unable to see how it was to wear other than trying on.


I have never in my life had a dress more flattering. I'm a size XXL in just about everything. I typically wear a 22 in shorts or jeans. This dress is gorgeous on me! Every time I wear it, strangers compliment it or ask where I got it. I love the black. Pair it with a string of pearls and you really look like you've got your sh- together.


Wasn't a fan of the material but fit well


Love the dress


Loved it getting every color!


It came wrinkled but the iron will solve that.


Love the fit and feel. Tons of compliments!


Love this dress! Bought it in two colors.
