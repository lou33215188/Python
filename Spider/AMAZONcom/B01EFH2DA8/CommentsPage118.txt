I ordered a xL but got a L but it's still a good fit just tighter up top


Cute dress. Blue is pretty color. Fits nice. Got a bunch of compliments.


Again you get what you pay for! Fabric more like cheap t-shirt material.


It is so comfy, and was better than expected


Nice dress that is decently conservative. It hits right below the knees. I think you could dress this up or down depending on what you needed it for.


Great fit and quality for a great price.


I adore this dress! Fits perfectly, comfortable, and my exact level of dressy casual.


Love


Fits perfect to size. Fabric super soft.  Very happy with this buy !!!


I loved this dress. I'm 5'2'' and 115 lbs and medium fit great.
