This was a little big on me and was longer in the skirt section than I liked but it is a very flattering style and the material is nice. You have to fuss with the fabric that crosses over the chest a little to get it to lay right but it is flexible and would accommodate a variety of bust sizes well.


The color is good. The dress is too clingy. This material shows all your sins that you want covered up.


The fit is as expected. As 5'1", 34DD, boxy figure. Small fits best. My review is 1 star because the material isn't as advertised. Note that SMALL sizes are made with 95% RAYON and 5% spandex, while medium sizes are made with 95% cotton and 5% rayon. The cotton/rayon combination feels better (softer),  slightly heavier, and doesn't seem to wrinkles as easily when compared to cotton/spandex. I wanted cotton/spandex combination in small size... I bought 4 different colors and I'll be returning most of them =(


Sadly the dress was paper thin. Poorly constructed and was returned, however the company reached out and asked if I would be willing to try another piece from their collection. I decided on a darling top. I ended up happy and had a great experience. Thank you Helen and Laksmi!!


Cheaply made; too much fabric; very unflattering.


I really like this dress a lot! It fits as expected. I ordered this one and the gray, I use them in my weekly work wardrobe. It's perfect for work, school events, and family functions. I wish I could afford to have one in every color! I am 5'4" and 160lbs and bought a x-large - great fit!


Pro:


-I cannot state how awesome this dress is!


-the waist is at my true waist


-I have received numerous compliments from my co-workers


-While not currently breastfeeding, I wish I had it when I did


-The chest area easily adjusts to show or hide as much cleavage as you want


-The sleeves are cut and cover enough so there is no dreaded pop out of extra boobage. I can move my arms around and I don't have to worry that the extra tissue between my arm and shoulder popped out. (HUGE WIN ON THAT ALONE)


-It's also cut low enough in the arms that I'm not tugging on it and there are no unsightly sweat spots.


Cons:


black is sold out :(


If you are looking for an inexpensive way to update your wardrobe, buy this dress!


beautiful and  well made . fabric  is thick and soft . drapes very well . 5'5, 190lbs- xl fits perfectly. i dont like how it looks on me - i am short and  round in waist - but that isnt the dresses fault ! it looks as good on me as a dress could !


I'm 5'5 & 155lbs. 34D. This medium fits perfectly. Seems like you could wear for an every day dress or even a wedding dress. It's not thin but not super thick either. This is going to be one of my favorite dresses. A little black sweater will be perfect if I get cold because of the short sleeves. I'm extremely happy about this. A person always worries about sizing when ordering online but I read other reviews & it was good. I might of gotten away w a small but I like the looseness. I could put a tank under for a pop of color by the breast area!


This dress is exactly what I hoped for! There is only reason it's not 5 stars, and that's because the wrap across the chest is two layers, and the inner layer seam is clearly visible against the outer, making it look a little puckered. Where other dresses failed, this one surpassed: the color is true to screen; the fit is amazing - no one part of the dress did not fit like it was made for me; the skirt is cute and hangs nicely. It is very slightly see-through if you pull it tight across your body, so dark undergarments are not recommended, and try to go for something that doesn't have visible seams - note, though, that a bright purple bra was NOT visible in any manner. Other than that, this is a dress I can wear to both work and around the home and town. I bought it in the orange and it's a sweet color, not too bold but just enough to turn a few heads.


I bought this dress for a graduation ceremony and love it!  I bought a few different dresses (thanks to free returns if I didn't like them) and picked this one to wear.  I love the color, and that it doesn't need to be dry-cleaned, just thrown into the wash and can be thrown into the dryer again to remove wrinkles.  I'm not a dress person so wash-and-wear is preferable.  This dress is comfortable and flattering, and I will definitely wear it for other occasions, and would recommend it to others.
