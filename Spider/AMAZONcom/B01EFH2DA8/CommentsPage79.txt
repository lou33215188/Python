Excellent Product


This dress is advertised as 95% cotton. The material label inside the dress says 95% rayon. False advertising!!! Very disappointed. Dress was also much shorter in length than the pictures show - unless the pictures are on someone 5 feet tall. I would like to give it a minus star.


I bought this for a funeral, I wanted something that would be comfortable and that I would be able to pack if need be. it was PERFECT. I can dress it up or down and I've gotten several compliments.


Loverly dress and fit is good.  I am 5'6 1/2"  about 1 25-130pds.  I like the color and will be ordering anther dress.


This dress was very comfortable and stylish!


Thrilled with this dress!  It fits perfect and and is very flattering!


I love this dress so much, the top can be pulled up to be work appropriate and pulled down to let the girls breathe at happy hour :D


Very comfortable to wear, highly recommended!


I absolutely love the dress.  The material is fantastic, soft good quality.  My whole family liked how it looked on me.


It's perfect, the matieral is nice and soft,had good weight to it. The length is up to my knee (perfect)  it something that can be both dressy and casual. And it's beautiful. :) I'm not a dress person but I absolutely love this one.


I wear a medium large and the xxl large fits well as the size chart suggets
