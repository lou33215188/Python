very nice dress but fits really big


Great fit but skirt is navy and top is black so not matching - like picture implies


Great comfortable dress. But I feel like it needs a belt of some sort. Plus I wanted a different color but it was all sold out.


I absolutely love this dress! It is made of good quality, thick fabric and flows beautifully. I am ordering more colors!


It didn't fit right, but the material was good quality and the customer service superb.


Even though it is a well-made garment and I love the color, it is way Too short waisted!  I will be returning this dress!


Great fit and color.


The dress is nice but a bit large! Dissapointed!


Perfect fit, super comfortable, love the dress. Ordering more in different colors!


I didn't like the material its like a thin tshirt.
