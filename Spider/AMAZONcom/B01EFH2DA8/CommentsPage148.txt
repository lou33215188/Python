Kinda huge, I thought it would be tight.


Love it! Little weird around the girls... almost like a nurse's scrubs but I just tucked one side under my breast and it was fine. Everybody loved it.


Great little dress for travel


nice...great material..runs really big.. order size down


Not what I expected. Have returned.


This is a great dress!


Awesome


I don't normally review items, but this one needed it! The quality is great, the fit is great, and the color (wine) is great! Hides the post baby belly and even fits with me being short. Felt great in it!


not at all true to size...way small!


Looks different then it does online.
