I ordered it, less than 48 hours later it arrived. Another 4 hours later, I was wearing it to a banquet. Super comfortable, fit just right. But you have to really use the fitting guide and go by the waist size. I wear an 8 in most department store dresses and I ordered a Large... and it fit just right.


Really like this dress. Very comfortable and fits well. I ordered a small for my 5'7" 140 pound frame so it's a little shorter than I like but I run into that with everything I buy! Beautiful color. I would order more, but the only thing I don't like is ironing it. 95% rayon takes a really hot iron, 5% spandex bunches up easily when ironing. If that doesn't bother you then this dress is for you! I'm lazy and prefer not to iron if I don't have to!
