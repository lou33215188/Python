I purchased a Large and I wear a 6-8 pants and it fits pretty well. So kinda weird sizing but it is a beautiful dress and comfortable also.


Beautiful color of burnt orange.  I got a size large and it fits perfectly.  I am 5'3' and right now 136-137 pounds. I would buy again in a different color.


Loved it! Nice quality, great color, true to size. I can't wait to wear it to work but I think I can dress it up for my husband's graduation with heals.


Bought one of each color


I bought this for my daughter. It looks really nice on her. She really loves it.


Get constant comments of, "Wow, you look so skinny!"  Went back and bought this dress in another color.


Super cute and really flattering :) i am going to buy more colors!


Looks good on the wife.


Nice fit and nice thick material. Very happy with this dress.


Such a cute dress! It is perfect fit for dancing and twirling... or maybe just waling around. The material is not as thin as some less expensive dresses so it doesn't look "cheap" even if it didn't actually cost so much. I've ordered another for myself and will be ordering one for my daughter soon.
