great


The fabric & sewing are quality (a good cotton knit dress is hard to find). The size chart the company provides is accurate and leads to a good fit. But the dress will be returned because the top portion looks awkward, since the shape of the bust darts on the inner layer is visible on the outter layer of fabric. Bust darts shouldn't be necessary on this style of wrap dress.


Its a fine dress


Great fit!


It fit perfect. I bought a medium based on the reviews. I normally wear a small. I'm 5'6" and it came to right at my knee. It came up high enough that I didn't need to wear a shirt underneath. I would recommend this dress.


Great color
