Very cute, cut well would order other items from this maker.


Dress is comfortable.  The fake wrap flatters the chest and waist.  Wish I would've bought more than one.


I love the dress style and color but it runs too small in the bust.


Great


Lovely and soft. Fits beautifully and hides a bit of the tummy. Very flattering!


Nice summer dress and great for traveling


Dress fits granddaughter nicely. She is almost 13 and likes classic styles, rather than styles for teens. Small was perfect for her as she moves from childrenâ€™s sizing.


Love the dress . It was too small had a hard time trying to return the dress. UPS was to expensive to return. USPS was cheaper to return the item.


Love the fit! I added a wide belt to dress it up


I reeeeally like this dress. it is the perfect length to wear to work and is appropriate. It fit the way I wanted it to.
