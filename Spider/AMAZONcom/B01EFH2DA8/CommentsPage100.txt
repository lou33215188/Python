LOVE LOVE this dress


Just too tight in the mid section for an XXL


Looks cheap.


Love it great fit


I don’t usually wear dresses but this is so cute!! Came at the knee for me, which I love!!!


I love this dress. It is well made, it can be dressed up or dressed down, and it is incredibly flattering.


It's cute.


This dress is definitely for a larger chested woman.


Comfortable, cute, and flowy! This is exactly what I was hoping for


Nice dress, but runs small, especially if you are thick in the middle. I’m a 10 and the large was too small.
