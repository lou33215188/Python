excellent for the cost


I love this dress. Very comfy, great for work or out with friends. Fits great. Ordered another one in a different color.


Really great material, SUPER comfy, and fit great!


The size chart is definitely correct to body measurements. order your dress according to this and it will fit nicely.  Very nice dress for the price


Very comfortable and very flattering


Cut wrong cheap fabric it didnâ€™t fit right


Fit is nice but material feels cheap and a little stiff. Not as flowy as I expected, but you get what you pay for


Very comfortable and fits as expected.


grogeous dress, good quality, and very comfortable i love mine! the other reviews were very helpful for deciding what size to choose.
