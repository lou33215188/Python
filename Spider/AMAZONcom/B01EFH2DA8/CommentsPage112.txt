Great dress!


This dress is amazing


Thick material, hides everything, I'm 5.4" 124lbs. Small fits perfect. Knee length, perfect for the office. Washed it and little to no shrinking.


I've always been skeptical about buying clothes online,  but I'm glad I took the chance! Love it! Fits perfectly! Glad I bought both the black and wine!


Very flattering, I wear it to work often.


Perfect little dress for the office, fits perfectly. Not bad for the price. I'm 5 ft 2'' and 125 lbs.


This dress fits AMAZINGLY! It hugs in all the right places. So flattering!!! Definitely buying more colors.


A little smaller than I expected and there was no larger size


Received several compliments on this.  Very comfortable and reasonably priced.


Fits and looks beautiful for such a reasonably priced dress.  I am very happy.  Nice color.
