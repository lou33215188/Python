Really nice dress. Neckline is modest which is a bonus. Would recommend to others.


Need to return it but no return label


A bit on the small size. Good quality fabric and true color


Love the fit and material looks great on!


Ran very small.


excellent fit.


This is a great dress - very forgiving. It's a heavy tee-shirt type material that drapes nicely. I'm 5'6", and the hem was mid-knee.


I wore this dress to a casual outdoor wedding, and was very comfortable (and got lots of compliments, too!). You can definitely dress up or down in this dress.


I purchased the blue, and it's true to color. It's such a great price that I intend to buy at least one more, in black, and maybe the burgundy too!


My only frustration is that there was not a tag in my dress that identifies the material. It did, however, have a 'cleaning and ironing' tag.


Perfect


Great dress. Ordered a large which was a tad too if. Next time I will order a medium. Flattering cut.


Comfortable and flattering
