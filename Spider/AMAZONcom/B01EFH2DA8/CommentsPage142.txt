Very nice!


This SHOULD have been a perfect dress: faux-wrap, v-neck, swingy skirt. For reference, I'm 5'8", 175 lbs, pear-shaped.  This dress was 1) too short, several inches above my knees; 2) too deep a v-neck, revealing my bra; 3) cut too deeply under the arms, showing a good 2-3 inches of my bra. This WOULD have been a perfect dress, had it been cut less skimpily.


Good. I bought 2


The fabric ia streachy and hugged your figure. I do not like to have my clothes that snug. It did not fit me and I am a little larger. Nice if you are smaller size and like to have a dress hug to your figure.


Nice fit!


Yes the dress  was gorgeous!


As reflected by the price, to call this a "Bridesmaids dress" is ridiculous. However, it is a very comfortable cotton-blend dress. I purchased it to make into a Halloween costume, and I couldn't have been happier.


Love, love, love this dress!!!!!


Very pleased


Very nice dress for church or for an evening out. This dress was bought for a 5'4" tall young woman that weighs around 120 lbs. She normally wears a size 5 or 7, and 34C bra. We followed the measurement guide, read the comments from confirmed purchases, and purchased a size medium. I washed and ironed the dress as soon as it arrived, then she tried it on. It was perfect! Not tight or form-fitting, but not loose...just perfect! She paired it with a black skinny belt and black heels. It looked great!! Modest length, modest cut. Perfect for wanting to look fashionable, without revealing too much, or the fit being too tight.
