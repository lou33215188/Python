Love it! I would suggest wearing a slip because it can be a little staticky


This dress exceeded my expectations!


I love love love this dress! It's a good length, the fabric feels nice, and it's super comfy! Great purchase :)


More work appropriate than I expected but I like it a lot and it's very comfortable. Not tight or unflattering in any way.


Love the dress!  Very good quality for the price and it fits me perfectly!!!


Nice casual dress and the length and flair makes it quite modest.


My wife loved it and I was surprised by the quality and design.


I'll agree with the others that the fabric is god quality, and so is the stitching.


Unfortunately the style was not what I expected. The neckline is really modest, and not flattering for a curvy girl like myself. Pulling the neckline down works so-so, because it makes too many wrinkles. Again, this might not be the case for you, I'm a DD.


The other big turnoff was the high waistline. It's not at the waist and it's not empire, it hits right in between, and I find it really unflattering.


I'm returning it, but it's not a bad product.


Very comfy, and classic lines!


Great look & feel.
