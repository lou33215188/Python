I bought this dress for my daughter to attend a sweet 16 it is very appropriate in length and fit


Comfy, flattering, and fits prefect! Considering ordering more in different colors!


This isn't really the color the picture makes it seem to be; it's a straight red. Not super bright, but pretty red.


I LOVE these dresses. They're so flattering and so comfortable! I'm buying them in every color that is even remotely flattering.


This is a stretchy-fabric dress from China.  I normally don't like clothes like this, but I LOVE it. It fits well and works really well for breastfeeding, which is why I bought it. It also hides the postpartum belly quite well :D


Beautiful dress! The color is vibrant and the material is like a thick and stretchy forgiving T-shirt. Can't wait to wear it out!


I ordered this on a whim. It fits perfectly, hits right at my knee and isn’t too revealing. The surplice neckline even allows for easy nursing! The material is soft and stretchy like a thick T-shirt. It hugs my curves nicely, but isn’t clingy. Will be buying more!


Love it,  Fits as expected and is great for curvy large chested individuals.  does not show too much cleavage


LOVE the dress, but the wrap on the breast area fits really weird. I will continue to wear it and enjoy it. Not seethrough or heavy. Great for a summer dress


I love the color and the texture of the fabric, but I am not thrilled with the lay of the ruching across the breast and stomach.
