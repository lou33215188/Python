Casual dress, fits nice.  Dress up or down, all good.


Haven't worn it yet, but it fits well and looks nice. It's a little wrinkly when you first take it out, but it looks nice once you steam them out!


Not as pretty as picture but a nice casual dress.


This is great for large busts and gives good coverage.  Great color. Fits as expected. Comes down a little low under the arms so a little bit of my bra shows, but not that bad. Very flattering dress!


Very soft and pretty!


It looks good on me, but the material stretches some after washing and is a little bit of a pain to iron after washing.


Beautiful fit!  This can be a fancy dress or casual! I'm a big girl but it accented my waist.  It's material is soft but has a Lycra feel that makes it form fitting.  I love it and bought it in wine and black.


Surprisingly gorgeous for such an inexpensive dress!!


Itâ€™s nothing to Like about the Dress?


Love how this dress flatters my curves.
