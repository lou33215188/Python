I love this dress, it's slightly stretchy, easy to  wear. As comfortable as active wear or even PJs- but looks like I actually made an effort to dress nicely. Easy care too


I love this dress. The color was a beautiful blue and it fit me perfectly.  I received a lot of compliments and plan to purchase in other colors.


I have this in black and loved it.  I did not like the gray one though.  It looked very boxy and the pleats looked weird.


The fit was right, the length is right, (I'm 5'7") and the weight is okay.  I like the dress, but was disappointed in the way I looked in it.


Never had a dress in this color and oh man such a great idea to buy. The color is vibrant and the dress fits soooo comfortably.


I LOVE this dress!  The cotton fabric is very soft - not too thick or too thin.  Fits perfectly.  It is a very flattering cut and fit, and it is my new go-to dress this summer.


Edit:I originally rated this product as 3 starts, but was contacted by Laksmi as they were sorry that the item did not meet my satisfaction and to see if there was anything to do.  The customer service is great and they will do what they can to make you happy.


Original Review:  It fits well and I love the cut, but the material is a bit cheap.


These are the cutest little dresses.  Easy wash and look great in a minute you're out the door. Money well spent.  They do come in different lengths


Super cute, simple dress for a good price! Versatile enough to be dressed down for an every day look or dressed up for the office.


I love this dress! The fabric is just little stretchy so it fits me without being restricting, and the neck can pull down so it makes this a great dress for nursing mothers. I got a ton of complements the first time I wore it!
