did not fit and  returned


The color was as expected but the quality was not to my liking


Amazing dress that fits true to size. The material is great quality, the neck line can be adjusted to show as much or as little cleavage as desired. I will be buying more!


Love this dress.  The fabric is wonderful.  So soft and comfy


Really cute dress, I wore it to a wedding this weekend and received a ton of compliments on it. I tucked both sides of the wrap neckline under my busy for a little more cleavage but thatâ€™s just my style, it also looks very nice with the neckline worn normally.


Dress was not designed to fit all sizes and shapes. My daughter is 5'2" and 125 pounds. Purchased size small and the dress was too big all around and too long in length. Dress is better designed for someone 5' 6" or taller and with at least a C cup bra size.


Simple and cute dress.


This dress is super comfy and looks amazing on. The fabrics is soft and light!


Fits and looks as described.


Nice dress! I bought two different colors. Good for office, quality is not bad and fits well. I'm 5'8, 135lb.
