The fit is as expected, the fabric has a nice weight to it almost feels like you’re wearing a t-shirt. A little long for my liking, but I’m 5’1.. I’ll just have it tailored.


This dress is the perfect color for my Disney bound as Elsa. It will also work for Cinderella too. I ordered a size bigger than usual to make room for larger chest and then it was big in the shoulders. That's typical for me. It's a great little dress.


This is a very good quality nice product and a value.  Looks on as shown in the photo - the crossover is high enough so if you are busty you do not have to worry about cleavage at all.  I am buying another!


Super flattering. 5'4", 135, 34DD. Ordered a Small


I love this dress! The material is definitely stretchy, so there's room to give or take on the size. I ordered the medium, I'm 5'8" and it is knee length, if not a little shorter. Potential to be a very good dress to conveniently breastfeed. I ordered the wine color and it's pretty similar to the picture.


Get a size larger it runs small but is very stretchy.  I love this dress..it is very flattering for the curvy girl


Very cute dress! Fit is nice and it looks great. Am considering ordering others in varying colors.
