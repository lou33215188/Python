Definitely need to size up, but the way the bust lays is really weird. Might work if you don't have much boob action going on, but any bigger and it just looks odd.


This dress is super cute and it came quickly and fits just right. I will say however when I first went to put it on I wasn't sure, because the top seemed very tight, but as soon as it was on, it loosened up. The skirt material is also really heavy which was shocking to me, I expected it to be lighter and the dress itself was a lot longer then I had thought it would be. Overall, I love it though.


This dress fits well the colors are great and the length is perfect. The only draw back I have found is that the faux wrap top is wrapped a bit too tight and limits the options for what bra I can wear. Anything with too much push up looks lumpy and anything with no push up looks too frumpy. Luckily I found a demi bra that smooths everything out.


I love this dress! I am 5 feet 5 inches (on a good day ğŸ˜‰). I'm 143 pounds. I've seven kids, ten years old and under. I bought a large, fit was just a tad big. I could have squeezed into a medium. But it hides what I want hidden. I want this dress in black once it comes in stock again! I wish there was a solid navy. I love that I can pull the v-neck down to nurse, although probably not advised! My daughters love when I spin, "just like a princess." Get this dress, so simple, feminine, and perfect to keep casual or dress up.


I am 170 lbs and 5'8".  I ordered the XL.  The cross over in front would not stay in place well and I felt like my bra was showing.  I returned.


This is a fantastic dress for an hourglass figure and also for someone who where is a larger cup size. I was pleasantly surprised with the fabric, not too clingy.  I ordered one size up as a few others had suggested and it will work but because of the larger cup size I could have probably gone 2 sizes up and been slightly happier.  Very fitted in the waist, but with lots of stretch and flowy over the hips so there is a lot of room for error in the sizing and one would still be happy with the fit


I bought the black multicolor. The material is different texture and color. The bottom floral skirt area is more of a navy blue and the top is solid black. The seams holding the two parts together looks a little loose in the back but overall it is a pretty and flattering dress if you are looking for a snug fit. I am not sure that this will hold up long term without seams needing reinforcement. For the price, I definitely want to buy another in a different color. I bought a medium and my dress size is between an 8 and a 10. It is a little tight on me. If you like dresses a little looser, you may want to go up a size if you are a 10.


I ordered this dress because I had a last-minute business casual event and there was no time to go shopping. I was nervous because it was due to arrive hours before my event. It is PERFECT. It is very flattering while still being appropriate for a work event. I had it delivered to my office, and after I tried it on, two of my colleagues also ordered the same dress. Even I immediately ordered a second one in a different color.


The v-neck is very modest, I am 5 feet tall and it is knee length. The material is stretchy. It was not wrinkled out of the box, so I could wear it immediately. I very highly recommend this dress.


Material is rough and doesn't flow at all. Returning because I expected something flattering and this wasn't it for me.


I Love this dress.  The fit is perfect, The cut is flattering.  I am a bigger woman, size 14/16 40" 36" 40".  Its so easy to see an unflattering cut on me and I am so happy with this dress.  I will certainly be shopping with Laksmi again.
