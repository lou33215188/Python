i love it


Great fit!


One of my favorite dresses. I now have it in gray and black. Fits beautifully!


Very pretty, even though it ran large.


:)


Love the dress, fits perfect. Plan on buying another color.


Cute dress and great saturated color but very clingy around the belly.  If you have had a couple of babies like me this accents the left over mom belly.


This dress is cute for summer time with sandals. It runs a little small. Light weight material. The color is bright pink and pretty.


Absolutely loved the dress. I'm 5' 2" and about 145 lbs. I bought a medium and the fit was just right. Beautiful dress.


This dress is great just think the skirt is very full.
