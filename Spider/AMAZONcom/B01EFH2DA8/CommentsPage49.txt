I love this dress. I thought it would be a flimsier material, even after reading the comments. It fits great, is very flattering, but I wish it didnâ€™t hold wrinkles as much.


Dress is so comfortable and flattering. A good fit and did not wrinkle.  Looked great all day!  Bought another one on the Wine color


The cut and color are nice though it ran a little bigger than I had expected. I'll wear this to work a lot.

Dress is for my wife.  Wife says it's comfortable as it's stretchy fabric, appears to be sewn well enough, sizing was accurate - overall a good purchase for the price.


Comfortable, basic dress.  It's a good value for the money. The purple is a pretty shade.  The length is just to the knee for me , at 5'4".  I may get another color


We were pleasantly surprised by the quality and fit of the dress. Depending on jewelry and shoes I can wear the dress just about everywhere.  Love it in gray!!!


What a good deal. Thanks Amazon prime.


Worn only a few times and seems are beginning to get holes. Loved it at first


I like the dress but it is about two size too small and I ordered a large and wear a medium . The quality is good.


This dress fit just right but I did order a XXL when I normally wear an XL  so I would order a size larger than normal.


The fit is great but the black floral dress is hideous. The top is black but the bottom is like a bluish color with pink and white flowers, it does not work together and it certainly is not what was pictured. I returned and got a plain black one.
