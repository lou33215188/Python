Super comfy and still very cute! Good length, right at my knees (and I'm short!), and good coverage even for big chested people. I cannot wait to buy more colors!


Very nice feeling and draping fabric but shows


every curve/roll...not attractive on me.  I'm 5'2.


135# and ordered a medium.  Rose was a pretty


color though.


Really impressed with the fit and material! Got a small based on other reviews, I'm 5ft5 and 130lbs and it was perfect! Looks more elegant than expected, great for date night or a weekend afternoon!


Love this dress. Extenuates my curves and extremely comfortable. Bought an XL and I'm 5"3 190 lbs. Fit perfectly. I'm not currently a mom, but this dress seemed like it would be perfect for breastfeeding mamas.


I'm 2X (5'9" and 230 lbs) and 40C. This dress fits me in all the right places It's great and accentuates everything you have. LOVE


Products arrived exactly as described and in a timely manner.  Great quality and price.  Order st least 1 size larger runs small.


Dry pretty dress! The fit is so flattering and the dress is so comfortable! Can be dressy or casual and the simplicity of it will make it your favorite little black dress.


Small, tight,  too short  and not flattering for full size, middle age woman. Returned. Although not for me.. other slim women my like. Company has been very nice and responsive. They sent me a shirt that I like.


I am a size 14/16 & the XL fits perfectly. The material is stretchy & forgiving. I love the fit. The color I ordered was magenta & says magenta on the tag but it looks more like a dark red or wine color (should have more pink in it). Not pleased with the color but not sending it back because of it either. I'll wear it.


I originally ordered a medium and it was a bit big, so I ordered a small. The small is even larger than the medium. So frustrating as it is a nice basic dress.
