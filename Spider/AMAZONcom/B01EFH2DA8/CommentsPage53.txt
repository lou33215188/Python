If you are busty, be warned.  This lays very weird across your bust.  The picture looks great and I've bought other dresses in this style that look great.  This just isn't one.  It is also sized smaller than U.S. dresses.  I had to return it the first time I received it and then I ordered it two sizes bigger than I usually wear and it was still a little tighter than I like.  To be fair, I have trouble buying dresses because I am very blessed, so I have trouble getting a size that isn't tight in the bust, especially from overseas.  This dress was too cute for me to pass up at least trying though.


The company is great with returns though, so if it doesn't work out for you, there is no hassle on the returns.  I think that is something that the company should be proud of and receive credit for - hence the 3 stars.


So while this dress didn't work out for me, it is still worth a try, which is why I gave it 3 stars.


It's perfect, I am 5' 7", 185lbs, the dress falls on my knees. I bought an x large and the feel of the fabric is amazing


Beautiful color nice material


Great looking dress, great fit and material.


So perfect! So comfortable. I’m buying another one


This dress was very pretty (especially the sky blue) but it ran small. I am 5'4" and shortwaisted and ordered a medium. It made me look even shorter and was too small.  A large would have been too big for me so I decided to return it.


I like this dress and it is very comfortable.  I'm going to purchase another one in a different color.


Just wasn't for me. Excellent returns. Great quality.


Amazing! Fits great I’m 127 lbs 5’2” got a size small


Very pretty but was disappointed with the fabric quality and dye. Very wrinkly and requires going at it with an iron big time. Washed once delicate cycle and I can already see it faded a bit.
