I love it.  What a bargin!  I am 5'3 138 lbs and the medium was perfect.  I got 1 purple and 1 black and I will probably order another color!

Very flattering style, fits perfectly.


This is a great cute for almost everyone. I like that the crossover front doesn't dip down low. It's a bit more coverage than some other crossover dresses I've found.


Good, and about what I expected.  For this price, I should probably give it a 5 stars, but I'm just not in love.  If you are a size 14-16 - with DD chest, the XXL will fit nicely. I'm 5' 7" and length to just below knee, which I prefer. Fabric is akin to a cotton leotard.  Black color isn't the richest black.  Looks like it *could* fade if you wash too warm, so I'd wash and rinse only on cold. Just like a leotard shrinks up on wash, I'd imagine this would too.  The breast coverage is great, but you'll have to play with the top to figure out how to make it flattering (wrapped under breasts and pleated looks great but leaves a lot of cleavage, while straight-across the chest wrap (no wrinkling) is a bit Maude.  Finding the happy medium may require adjustments during the day (this is probably the case with most wrap tops.. maybe I'll fashion tape it).  I'd wear to work as a teacher if I dressed this up a bit with a tunic wrap or something. Overall, if nothing else, its a fun little comfy dress for casual days.


Fits well and is extreme flattering!


I love this dress so much. I got a lot of compliments. Very stretchy and shows my form well. I've been thinking about getting it again but in a different color.
