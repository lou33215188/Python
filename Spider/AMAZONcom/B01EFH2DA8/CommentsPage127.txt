It fit great and worked great for my Halloween costume this year


Finally wore it today.  Fits great!


I would recommend buying this dress, it is true to size and very comfortable.


Nice fit and sized just right.  Very pleased. Color as shown.


Super flattering fit


Nice style/shape but the color doesn't work for me.  Very slightly smaller than expected.


Nice and flattering but the material is a little thin. More of a work style dress.


Perfect


The color is beautiful and is very comfortable.


a little tight, not true to size.
