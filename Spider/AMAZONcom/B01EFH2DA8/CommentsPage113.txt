Sits a little awkwardly around the bust, but everything else is great.


Flattering cut, very comfortable, and easy to dress up or down.


Dress fabric more casual in actuality than it appears online. Although it was my regular size, I had to return it as it was too tight a fit.


Looks good


haven't washed it yet, so not sure how it will hold, but the fit and fabric are great! I'm 5'2" and 125 lbs.


I like this easy to wear dress.


I love this dress.  It is comfortable and stylish.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I wear a large, but it does not make me look fat...


True to fit, very comfy!  I have a long torso and the dress hits right above my knees, perfect length!


very poor fabric quality. unable to get the wrinkles out.


So cute! Fits really well and I like it better than I thought I would.
