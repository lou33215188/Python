Dress was too big


Gorgeous , functional , versatile dress! The first day I wore this not only did I love it but I had at minimum three people ask me where I got this!


Cute dress, but too low in the top, and short in skirt, for tall girl. Will need to add an under-layer to wear comfortably.


It is nice design but the size chart wasn't accurate. The dress is not meant for someone who has a smaller bust. I ordered a size small and the top clearly doesn't fit.


Nice fit and good weight to material. I picked out the light blue which is a really prettt sky blue color.  Nice length. I recommend something under this like a cami or shaper as it does show any rolls or bulges you have.


Material feels cheap. Front V on the bodice is too high. Pretty comfortable. Washes and dries with ease.


was not the size they advertised - 2 sizes to small


I'm glad I ordered a size up. I usually order a M and wear a size 8-10, but I'm glad I listened to the other reviews and sized up. The fabric has a nice thickness and weight to it. It's very comfortable and light enough to wear in the summer, but I think I can still wear in it the fall/winter with a sweater and tights.


Loved this dress!! Fits great I wore it dancing and its comfortable and breathable.


have not worn the dress yet, only tried it on. The fit is good, love the color.
