Love it.


I love this dress! I am lazy with laundry and so it gets washed in cold water with the rest of my good clothes,but then in the dryer it goes. I have another one in grey and love them both.


Very comfortable and beautiful!  I am so glad I made this purchase!!!


Love the dress, but it runs small


I ordered a small. I'm a 32E, size 2/4 pants. Fits amazing!!


I love this dress.  I usually wear. 14 and bought the xl. It fits perfectly. The dress is extremely flattering and I always get complements.


This dress is adorable.  It is definitely casual and comfortable as a tee shirt.  Very well made and cute dress for the price.  Would like it in more colors.  Even the boyfriend gives it a 10!


It is a great looking dress. Love the color and it hides any body imperfections.


This is a very comfortable dress. I own another one in the wine color. They are lightweight and good for spring and summer. It's the perfect length.


So pretty. Just need to adjust the wrap


Where you want it. It can be low cut or higher depending on your event. Length and size true. Rich color.
