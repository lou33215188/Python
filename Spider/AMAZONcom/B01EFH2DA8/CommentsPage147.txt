The dress arrived as expected and fit as expected. I used the measurement chart and ordered accordingly.  I loved it!  I hate my hips and thighs, not to mention the lumps and bumps. The A-line design of this dress helps to hide those and instead accents my waist and chest.  I am about to order an additional color.  Thanks!


There is a hole in the back of the dress.


It fits and feels so good.  I have the classic hour glass figure with a larger bottom and this dress flatters but is modest at the same time.  Hubby said I could not go out without him. ğŸ¤—  If I had one wish it would be that the cap sleeves would be short or 3/4.


Dress is a nice thick, stretchy fabric and washes well too. It is very comfortable and I received a lot of compliments when I wore it! The torso of the dress is a little short and I'm only 5'2" so that would be the only negative thing I would say about the item.


I love the way it fits my shape...very flattering and I really appreciate how it "gives" in the waistline.  I bought two dresses and I love the colors . These dresses are comfortable and pretty.


Fits nicely in the waist and length but makes my chest look non-existent. I got a large because I have a 31" waist but I have a 34" bust and I knew I had to make a decision. So I chose the large and now I'm thinking maybe I should have gone with a medium since the material gives a little and I plan to lose weight anyway. I'm keeping the large though because I don't want to take a chance on exchanging it and it being worse. Thick material, no need for a slip. Comfortable except for feeling like I need to keep adjusting the chest. Overall, not bad but wish it fit better.


This ^ was my initial review on this dress. But since then the seller has contacted me and gave me a choice of any of their dresses FOR FREE. I decided to get the same dress in a size medium to see if it would fit better. Wow, was I surprised! It fits great! Still comes down to my knees, fits in the waist, and not too big in the bust! Very happy with it and VERY impressed with the seller! I see that there are more colors now. I might just buy a few more colors now that I know a medium fits so well. Very comfortable dress, just didn't have the right size on the first try.


Cute dress...shows me I need to tighten up


Happy wife, happy life.


The dress came with a stain on it I am going to see if I can get it out. I wonder if somebody worevthe dress than returned it cause how could a new dress be stained? The fit is fantastic.


So badly wrinkled I could not even tell if it fit correctly.  Sent it back.
