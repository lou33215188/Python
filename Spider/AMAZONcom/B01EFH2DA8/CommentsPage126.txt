This fit perfect! I love it!


I wasn't happy with this dress. The sizing was wrong.


I love the colour and the fit.  I give it ağŸ‘�.  This dress will fit all body type and look good


Plus size has a nice fit too! Inexpensive yet very cute


What a darling, affordable dress!  Very flattering fit.


Wonderful dress! Very flattering and comfortable. I love how it looks! You can dress it up or down.


I do like this dress, cut is perfect and it stretches without getting clingy on the wrong spots, for my 5'8'' it hits right below the knees. If they had a 3x available it would maybe be a little less tight, but it still fits nicely. I am usually between 2x and 3x depending on material and space for the breasts. Still love it and I am getting it in another color. I wish this vendor other models had the same sizes available. I have not washed it yet, so I cannot tell how the fabric will keep, but as it is, it feels nice against the skin.


Has a leotard feel.  Would be 5 star if it were cotton.


Too much material from the waist down


Its ok, had I tried it on at a store, I would not have purchased it.
