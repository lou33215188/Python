I'm 5'5, 32D, and 150lbs. After looking through the comments, I purchased a Medium of this dress to wear at work in an office setting. I have worn this dress 3 times since purchasing it and so far I'm very pleased with the quality for the price! The fit IS a little loose on me, and if I had to buy it again, I would purchase a small. However, I do look forward to wearing this dress more! It is SUPER comfortable and definitely modest enough to wear to a conservative office setting (neckline and hemline are both office-appropriate). As a bonus, each time I have worn the dress so far I've received compliments! I will definitely be purchasing more colors in the future!


Very comfortable.
