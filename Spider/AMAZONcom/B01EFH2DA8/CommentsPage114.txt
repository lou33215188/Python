Only issue I had was I wish they had a small. But the medium does fit fine. Soft material and not see through at all


Love this dress. Bought this dress as a gift for my daughtrer and she loved it. Fits her perfectly its not to tight.


I first got this dress in gray and loved it so much I got another in wine. It's incredibly convenient for the nursing/working/pumping mom.


Run on the bigger side. Cute but fabric didn't fall quite right on my hips. Returned.


Love this dress! Fits well, very comfortable and flattering. Love the twirly skirt!


Ordered X-Large size, cannot even fit my teen daughter who wears a medium


Comfortable and pretty. It fits better on someone with a longer torso.


Beautiful fitting even after wash. It shrinks a bit but that made it even better


Cute dress. Fits as expected.


Very soft material and fits good
