I ordered a small. I'm five feet tall and this is perfectly to my knees. I'm also a 32DD and it's stretchy enough to accommodate a curvier top. I like that even though it's a vneck, it's not super low cut.


This dress is great quality and the fit is perfect. I ended up ordering it in multiple colors. Dress can be worn casual or dressed up more for a night out. Would look great with a belt too.


So flattering! I love it but I think I'm going to give it to my breastfeeding sister! I'll probably end up buying another one!


This is a really flattering dress.  I think it would like cute on most people.  It is extremely comfortable too!


I liked this dress so much I bought a second in another color.  It is very comfortable and can either be informal or more formal (with a belt, maybe).


Pretty dress, looks nice, but I have a tall torso so it's a little short in the "shirt" area.


Overall, I like it and would recommend.


Fits perfectly, so comfy and it’s made with a very nice material! I wore it to the office today and received so many compliments, but what’s more is I felt great as well! Wonderful dress for the price. I’m 5’2” of average build and ordered a small, the dress came down to my knees and was just so flattering!


Such a cute dress for a great price! The material is nice and thick too- it doesn't feel cheap. I will wear this in winter with a cardigan and boots and in the summer with some sandals. I am 5'4, 125 lbs. and the medium fit me perfectly.


This is a beautiful comfortable dress. Easy to wash. You can wear it for every day or dress it up for night. I am top heavy and this dress covers all. The skirt is full and comes to just above my knee at 5'6". Grey jersey tends to run a little small. I ordered one size bigger in grey and I am glad I did..


Loved it!
