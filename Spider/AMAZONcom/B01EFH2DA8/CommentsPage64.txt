Love it!


What a flattering and comfortable dress!


I have received many compliments when wearing this dress.  I am 5'1", 105lbs and bought a small.


First of all, the product tag says 95% RAYON 5% Spandex, but is listed as 95% Cotton 5% Spandex. I absolutely hate wearing rayon in the summer and specifically wanted a little cotton dress to keep cool. The fabric feels kind of stiff straight out of the bag and definitely not soft like cotton would be, but the weight of it is nice and not too thin. However, following the measurements I land somewhere between a large and a medium - large Bust and medium waist. I ordered both, and was totally swimming in the large and medium was unflatteringly bunched and loose still. I'm a little under 5'5 and 145lbs, and I wear a large in juniors pretty much everywhere. The skirt is long snd conservative, past my knees. Overall with it looked too matronly and unflattering, size chart and materials listed are completely inaccurate.


Really like this dress. Stretchy, comfortable and cute :)


Very comfortable. Beautiful dress. Fits as expected. Stretchy.


The top is definitely blue, and the bottom is black. Does not match.


I cannot wear this dress. It is too small. I should have ordered a larger size.


Another great creation by this company.  Great style.  Nice, comfortable fabric.  Perfect casual, business dress.


The only reason it's given four Stars I said because the fabric looks black and it's clearly blue but I don't hate it. I like this dress. And if you wanna be boobylicious this is a perfect choice.


I love it. Great fit. Great color. I ordered another color.
