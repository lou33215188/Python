New favorite dress!


My daughter bought this for a wedding, and she loves it.


Loved this dress!!! It's loose enough in the waist to not hug curves that you don't want to show. Color was great. It was a tad longer than I would normally like but that was my only criticism.


Same as the other.  Style is terrific but color was more pink on line.


This dress is so comfortable! I ordered a large and I’m 5’5” and about 150lb. It’s a little too tight across my bust, but that’s almost unavoidable for me. Otherwise this is a wonderful dress for the price and the only thing it’s missing is pockets!


It’s a pretty color and has a nice stretch if you’re worried about sizing. My only issue is that even at 5’7 the hem fell to the bottom of my knees. I’ll hem and wear it but I was looking for a Saturday night dress not Sunday morning.


Super cute but loose.  I'm sending back and getting the XSM.


I bought a blue dress and a black dress.  Both are very nice.  They fit as expected.  The material is good and drapes well.  I purchased on a gold box deal and the value for the money was very good.  I am quite pleased.


Dress is comfortable and great for everyday wear and nights. The medium was a little too big so they were very helpful and provided me a smaller size.


This dress is soft and stretchy, perfect for a lazy summer day. It sits well on my waist, showing the hour glass curve of my body without showing any extra baggage around the middle. It falls to just at my knees and is flattering on me even as a plus size woman.
