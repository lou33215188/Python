Exactly as expected.  Comfortable and nice enough to wear at work. V-neck is not too deep.


If it were a little bit longer, I would have kept it. The quality is just okay. I sent it back.


not quite the colour I was going for but the fit is perfect


Pretty & simple dress for any occasion. Will be perfect on vacation.


I absolutely love this dress. When I took it out of the packaging, I thought, "Meh" as it looked something like a t shirt. But when I tried it on? Shazam! It has enough Lycra in it to make it fit in the right places and the color is awesome. I will definitely be ordering  a couple more of these in different colors as they are good for work or for going out.


The material is really itchy and the fit is unflattering


I love this dress!! It is very flattering and works well for girls with big chests. I think I may get one in every color and pattern.


Ok, I bought this for my wife, and she likes it, so of course I like it!  Color was nice, and the fit was good.


Did not fit. I ordered an XS as i always do, was big, retured.


This dress is simply amazing!  Afordable, a perfect fit and completely flattering.  It's hard to believe I didn't have to comb the malls for hours to find something so exceptional.. it will work in both a casual and more formal settings.  A simple cut but not hanging or frumpy, as some one-piece "over-the-head" can sometimes be.  Follows lines and contours perfectly!  Thank you Laksmi!
