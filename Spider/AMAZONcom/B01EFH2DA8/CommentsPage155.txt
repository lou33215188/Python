This is a very cute dress for the money.  I really like the feel of the material.  It breathes and is very comfortable even on hot day.  I just washed it in my washer and then I hung it up to dry.  It looked fine after the washing.  Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this item in exchange for testing and giving my unbiased and honest review of this product.  I hope you found my review informative and helpful.  I would appreciate it if you would mark that this review helped you in some way.


Got this dress after buying a different dress I did not like from another company. I was skeptical because I am a bigger woman, but like thinga to fit and I got a dress I will wear for every occasion and I plan to buy more in other colors. I also paired it with a brown faux leather belt and ot is super cute. Will recomend anytime.


This black dress fits me perfectly… I love the soft cotton and how it wraps around me and tucks in at all the right spots… It is the perfect dress for a night out on the town or a dinner at a special spot… add a bit of color with a scarf belt and it is just beautiful. The flair of the skirt is really complimentary to my shape… it is possible to wear boots or even heels with this one but I would leave the flats at home unless they are sparkly and eye catching.


Good quality with no weird stitching… I love it

I wear dresses on very rare occasion, but its closer to never. It drives my husband crazy. This dress is nice because it doesn't show a lot of skin. The length of the dress goes to my knees and looks nice with my black flats. The dress is light and flowy. The fabric is soft and comfortable! If I were to every have an occasion to wear a dress I would wear this dress. It fits nice and looks nice too. I recieved the black one, but was interested in other colors as well.

I ordered this is black, and it is exactly as pictured. It is similar to a very heavy weight t-shirt material, but thicker. And the dress says only 5% spandex, but it has a lot of give to it so it is easy to put on and it holds in place nicely. This is a SUPER comfy dress. I think the size fits true, but with the exception that it is stretchy enough that if you get a medium it will stretch to large too, the smaller sized larges that is. The cross over v-neck is great even for larger breasted women there is plenty of material without cleavage. The dress hangs down to about knee length depending on your body shape and height. I purchased this item at a discount for an honest review. I will definitely recommend this dress, it is made nice quality fabric.


Received this today, so I haven't worn it yet but here's my initial thoughts: The top fabric is weird and a bit rough like an older t-shirt that's been hang dried.. The bottom skirt's really soft, but I was under the impression the background color of the shirt would be black, rather than the dark faded navy color it is... The entire skirt part just kinda looks faded and weird.... I tried it on and the sop black part seems to sit a little loose... Almost like it's for someone with really big boobs.... Not amazed by it, but I ordered off amazon and that's what I get, I guess..


I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review for my wife when she saw the shirts. So far she has been relatively pleased with the quality but the sizing diagrams provided by the seller aren't up to standards you would typically expect. The dress isn't tight by any means but it's very short and she'll most assuredly have to wear leggings beneath it when she does wear the dress.

Pros/Cons: This is a first for me. I would say this dress is at a 3.75 stars. I shall explain. I do not know how to exactly describe this dress. Some reviews say small sizing and some say runs big. In my case, it is both?! How? I have no idea. I received this dress and the material feels nice and thicker than expected, but in a good way, not in a hot/sweaty sweater-dress way. I tried it in and was super confused. I was happy with it but could not understand it. Here is why: I have a large chest, DD and would be considered top heavy. The dress surprising covered my chest area very nicely, nice enough to wear to work, which I always have difficulty with, but also nice enough that if I wanted to push it down a tad I could go out on a hot date. Not saying I would do that, but you know; it’s good to have options. Here is the weird part: it fit my chest area and was nice on my waist and then all of a sudden it sort of “poofed” out and looked like I had a circus tent on. It is not necessarily “unflattering”, but it is just odd that the fit is so odd. Yes, maybe I have an odd shape, with a large chest, small waist and bottom, but to be that off is something I have not encountered, ever. Now to add weirder to this odd fit, my mom who is very petite tried on the same dress and it looked the same on her as it did on me, which I am probably 75 lbs. heavier than her. How the heck? Nonetheless, this isn’t NOT a prom dress, however, it is a nice quality dress and you can dress it up or down with accessories, shoes, etc. I will end up sharing this dress with my mom which is indeed weird but hey, works for both of us! I placed the Pros and Cons together here because I am not sure what is a pro or a con. I do not believe that it will fit 100% as it does on the mannequin, which looks like a 12 year old boy, but I do think it’s a cute dress overall.

Thank you!


I'm a nursing mom with a bra size 32J so I ordered an extra large. It fit my bust really well but the waist was a little to big. I think a large would have fit better. Also I am 5'3" and it fit me just below the knee. Overall, it is super comfortable and I love it!


Im 5/2 160 Ibs. I got a large it fit great.  I felt pretty and loved how the bottom twirled.  Doesn't hug your stomach,  is actually good for a small belly.  Comfortable.
