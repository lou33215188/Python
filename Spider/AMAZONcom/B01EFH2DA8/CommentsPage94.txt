returned because plans changed


Very pretty, love it


Well, I keep coming back to buy more colors.  I love it.


Comfortable, although material is thicker than expected. It's easy to breastfeed my daughter while wearing as well. Highly recommend.


Nice material, not see through, and very flattering! I love the wrap style that has a high enough neck to wear to work.


Material isn't the most durable and it shows everything, but I like it.


Nice full figure fit. Arms a bit snug, but fabric is very flexible. Color is not as brilliant as pictured, but just right for a casual look.


Dress more polyester and stretch.  Considering purchasing a petite coat for fullness. Considering ordering another color.


Will work great for breastfeeding. I love the empire waist and how nicely it fits. Itâ€™s a nice, stretchy cotton. Great price.


I love the fit of this dress.  I was hoping for a little bit more of a fancier material but as it is, it is very comfortable. The material reminds me of downeast basics t-shirt material.  I'm 5'5'' and 155lbs.  Very top heavy (36DD) so I went with a XL.  I could have gotten away with a large but I ordered up worried it would be too small.  It fits fine.  One perk I wasn't expecting is that if I had to I could breastfeed in it!  Wish they had more colors as I would order another. 4 stars as the material is pretty plain.
