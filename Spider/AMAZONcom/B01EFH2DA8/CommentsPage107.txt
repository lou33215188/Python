A little smaller than I expected, waist is a little too high for me. 5'9". Size medium.

This dress is super comfy and flattering. The material is stretchy with the feel of cotton. The fit was true for my particular size.

Beautiful dress!  Perfect for casual or dress-up!  The fabric is comfortable and breatheable!


Love the dress super comfortable I ended up buying it in 3 colors! Perfect for everyday


comes in just below the knee. a little difficult.


Very pretty.  I ordered my regular size and it fit perfectly.  The material is soft and the hemline is flattering for someone who isn't 20 years old anymore.


Love this dress, I got so many compliments! The material is great, and it's wash and wear, too, no need for an iron. Love it!
