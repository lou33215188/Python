LOVE this dress!!!  Wore it to church and got about 100 compliments.  Love love love!


Perfect fit. Color perfect. Plan to order in red and black.


wayyyyyy to small


The dress is very nice quality.  The material is not too thin and it fit as expected.  I received a lot of compliments on it.


Love this dress!  Fits well and is very comfortable.


I love this dress! It makes my lumpy bumpy body look ah-mazing! It makes my saggy flappy boobs look spectacular! This dress is a magic dress. No joke. Seriously though, it sounds like I'm kidding but I'm not. This dress really makes me look awesome. I normally look like a sack of potatoes with a head walking around, but not with this dress! (ok that was a slight exaggeration but still.) I bought the light blue and I also bought a little red belt on Amazon and a red clutch and a red necklace to go with it because I had some nice red shoes in my closet. I'm going to post a picture of me wearing the dress as soon as all the accessories arrive. My waist is 35 inches, my bra size is 38D and the large fits me perfectly. Also I am 5'2" and I was a little worried that this dress would be too long on me but its not, it hits right below the knee for me which is perfect because my thighs are an abomination to all things holy and good. I hope this review has helped anyone on the fence about this dress. Seriously, if you're body is far from perfect like mine and you're coin purse is close to empty like mine, then this is by far you're best bet. Good luck and let those sack of potatoes shine!


I love it...it looks so expensive!


Very soft and comfortable. Not too much cleavage (good for work). Good length (right at knees).


Would like to buy in more colors!


Fits great.  I just wish the waist and length was 1-2 inches lower.


Perfect little black dress
