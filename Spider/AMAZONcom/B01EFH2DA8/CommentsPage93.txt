I can wear sizes 6-10 depending on what style dress I'm looking at. I bought a medium and the dress fits really nicely!


This dress is so cute and comfy. The material is like a thicker extra stretchy t-shirt. Clings nicely without showing too much. Sexy and still very classy


Weird rayon material.


Lots of compliments wearing it today!!


I love the fit and feel of this dress however from the item description of "bridesmaid dress" I expected the material to be somewhat dressier. I'm going to have dress it up a little more then I was expecting for the occasion I am wearing it for.


great dress like the fabric a lot


it is more casual than dressy, but nice


Love it. Ordered one in gray.


Beautiful fit, lots of compliments!


I've been shopping for a while for a dress to wear to my granddaughter's wedding in July.  Finally found this one.  Perfect!  I may order another in a different color later.  thank you Laksmi and Amazon!
