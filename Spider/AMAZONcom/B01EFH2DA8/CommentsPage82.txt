for a wedding this fall


I bought this comfy gray flattering dress to wear after a surgery knowing that having no waistline on my stitches would be more comfortable than pants. It's comfy, stretchy, flattering, and just the right length in the sleeves and hemline.  Perfect dress to dress up or down.  I hope it washes well, and if so I'll be back for the black one.


Waist line set to high under breast.


Beautiful and very comfortable dress.


Ok


Love this dress and it fits perfect. I went for medium and I am 5'7" and 126lbs.


Such a comfortable and stylish dress!


Comfortable, cute dress.
