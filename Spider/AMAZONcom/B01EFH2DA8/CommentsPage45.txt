This dress fits perfectly, and is very flattering for my 2.5 month post baby body. It's also easy to pull down the neckline for some fast nursing.


Great dress!  Comfortable and flattering. I can't believe how cheap it was. The quality is much higher than you'd expect at the price.


LOVE THIS DRESS - i got it in two colors because i loved so much.  I am a 2xl and it really looks good.  Very happy


Nice simple, light dress, fits perfectly but after first wash it faded slightly. Looks like the material color is not going to hold up long.


I bought two of these dresses, they fit nicely (size large- I am 5'5", 158 pounds, 36 B chest).  The one bit of weirdness is the dresses are rayon and spandex, not cotton as advertised.  I'm keeping them, they are good for most events, travel and work, but they are not cotton.


It looks stylish. The size fitting is normal. I havenâ€™t worn it yet but the quality looks alright.


I constantly get compliments on this dress when I wear it!  I love it!!


I did like this dress very much. I returned it because it was too big for me. I ordered a Large, I'm a size 12.


Sizing chart was right on I usually wear a size 8-10 so the medium was perfect for me. Great product! Would definitely but from Laksmi again


It fits o.k. but is much much shorter than it appears to be in the photos.  I cannot wear a dress this short.
