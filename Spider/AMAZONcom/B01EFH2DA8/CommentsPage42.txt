It fits great and looks very nice on . When I wore it I got some very nice complaments.


I've never ordered a dress online before, so I was leery, but I'm impressed! Nice fabric. This dress would be flattering on multiple body types. I'm curvy and 5'3" and the length is good - bonus, I don't look dumpy.


This is such a nice fit and if your curvy it makes your weights look slimmer worth the price, however run a bit big i got a large when i should have ordered a medium


I got compliments from EVERYONE. I will buy in more colors! Looked great with leggings and a cami underneath.


Super cute and comfy dress. I like that it is long enough to wear to work these hot summer months and that the wrap top actually covers my boobs.


Just doesn't look as good as I thought.


I would love to write a review of this blue dress that I bought for my wife, but unfortunately I was never sent this dress. I opened the bag and inside was a long sleeve, burgundy dress. We like these dresses. The material is great. Quality too. Just so confused on how we got a different one than what we ordered.


I am 5' 2" and where a size 16 pants and a 42dd. I bought a xxl to be safe and i am soooo glad I did. The dress fits perfectly and i dont have to keep adjusting it and pulling it down. The design for abdomen and chest compliments my curvy features and makes me look slimmer. Who doesn't want thatğŸ˜‰. Best dress I ever bought!


Very flattering on a fuller figured woman.


I needed a "little black dress" and the fit is good--actually, it's flattering to someone with a larger bustline, so I'll be keeping this one!
