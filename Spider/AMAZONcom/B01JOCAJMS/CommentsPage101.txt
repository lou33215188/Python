I got a 2xl and it fits me. I am 5'3" and 230 lbs. I read reviews and got what I would normally get. I love the design and how soft it is.


Not what I expected. Didn't fit well.


Love the stretch fabric. The fit is true to size. May need to wear a slim fit under panty to smooth stomach area. It fits over head. No zipper to deal with.


It fits okay.


This dress is comfy and simple, but seeing as I am 5'1 it was WAY too long. Definitely going to have to get it shortened. It would be long on anyone under 5'7


Fabric is thing and clingy, will be returning


No shape. Like a nightgown. Returning it


The dress fits great and the material is wonderful. I am 5'3 and I weigh 145 pounds, I ordered a large. The dress came down to just below my knee.


Super cute, nice fabric with just enough stretch, color is pretty much what I expected - perhaps a tiny bit more lemon yellow, but no complaints.


Dress is super cute but very thin, a little see through
