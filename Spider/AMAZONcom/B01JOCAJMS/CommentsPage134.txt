Fits me perfect!!! LOVE LOVE IT!!!


It was ok


Very good


The material wasn't the quality I had expected.  This is more of a polyester-blend to it.  The fabric is soft enough and has a very slight sheen to it, but it's not the kind of fabric that I prefer.  Also I wanted this for the beach and this kind of fabric doesn't breathe as well as I'd like and tends to retain warmth, so won't work for me.  I had also thought the collar would be a bit wider than it was.  It looks bigger in the picture, so while this fit, it was snug and the material clung around the shoulders and bust and was a smaller-fitting collar, so had a different look than I had wanted.  It did overall look like the picture though, just that the collar is a bit higher.


Totally fit as expected. Would purchase again


I got the XL, am 5’7, 200lbs. It’s perfect!!!! It lays over your curves without clinging. Wore mine as Lucy Van Pelt for Halloween.


True to size! Great length!


This is the comfiest dress out there. It feels like pajamas. I'm 5'5" and it comes right to my knees. I'm rather chesty, and it's not a problem as long as I wear a black/nude bra. (The material is a bit thin when stretched). I wear a large or extra large in US women's sizes, I ordered the XL and it fits well. Perfect!


Loved the material! So comfy!


A friend recommended this dress to me, and I am so glad she did!  I absolutely love the fit.  I am 5' 1", size 12 on bottom, and 14 on top, and bought the Large.  If you're about my size and don't want it form fitting (however, it does not looked stretched out on my bust), I would recommend the XL.


While I love this dress because it is flattering for my hourglass shape, it does not work for all body shapes.  The one I gave my mother, who has an apple-shaped body, is not so flattering.  I also purchased one for a friend with a pear-shaped body and she absolutely loves it.
