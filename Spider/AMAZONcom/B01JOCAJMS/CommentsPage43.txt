Pretty see-through.. I wasn’t super impressed with the quality and it’s awkwardly long.


Loveeee how this dress fits and looks! I added a 3in thick belt for added accessories!


I love this dress and wear it often. I am a little under 5'6 and 135 and DD. I purchased a medium and it fits great.


I've only had it on for a little (and haven't washed it) but the fit is great. I bought it (yellow) for Halloween, but I'm tempted to buy another in a color I would wear more. Great dress and soft! And the price-can't beat it!


Love it, it was for a funeral, it arrived right on time, it fit perfect, (I'm 5' 4", weight 125) I ordered a small.  Would order again in a different color.


I like the fitting. The fabric is good but mire suitable for casual use. Print is cute


Not perfectly fitted but this is a great dress for the price. I wore it to graduation and it was comfortable all day. I'm 5'8" and 125lbs and the dress goes right above my knees so for shorter ladies expect some hemming or fabric glue. Otherwise this dress is soft and really lovely


A truly rich green.  Great for work and semi casual dress wear.  True to size and length.


Very nice dress, it's lightweight and the fabric is soft. I bought this for a summer wedding and it's just right for that.


I was hoping for a slightly lighter shade, but the color is still great! I got this dress in green. Keep in mind, this dress is more like t-shirt material, but could be dressed up with a nice cardigan and belt if needed. I’m 5’7 and definitely on the heavy side, but the dress came down to my knees. Good for those hot summer days.
