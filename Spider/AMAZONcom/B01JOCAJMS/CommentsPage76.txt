I got a large after reading the reviews.  Fits just the way I wanted, not too tight or too loose. I am 5 2"  155 lbs. Hits a couple inches below knee.


I love the looks of this simple dress.  Can be dressed up or down.


Great dress and very comfy! I just wish it had pockets.


See thou it.


Had to send it back...


It's very comfortable. It fits great!  I love it!!


Very cute!  Fabric is thin but not too see through.  I am 5 foot 7 and 160 pounds, I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly


fabric a bit cheap- pilly but nice fit


Runs a little big but super cute


I used the sizing chart and chose accordingly.


I love wearing this dress. It fits well, it's casual and easy to care for.


Good price and I love it
