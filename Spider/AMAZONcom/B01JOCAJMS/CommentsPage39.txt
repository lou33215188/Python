I love this dress so much I ordered 2 more in different prints. As far as sizing goes I am 5'4" and 150 lbs. I ordered a large based on my measurements and my preference for a looser fit.


I haven't done more than try this on, but it's comfortable and fits as I thought it would.


So comfortable and cute! Breathes well from a great material and is super flattering. I'm 5'7, 185 lbs and bought an XL. The dress hits a little below my knees.


Love!! Will be buying more! 5'7 170 pounds, got a size large and it fits great, ends just below the knees.


This dress is so cute! I'm 5"4 and 150 lbs and I got a medium.


Really like this dress. The fabric is just heavy enough to cover nicely and light enough to fall nicely. A bit longer than most (which I like). Price is great and can easily be worn year round with a sweater or jacket in the fall and winter.


I LOVE this dress. Fit perfectly and being 5'10" it wasn't too short which is usually the case with dresses. I have about 10 of these in various colors!


Soft and comfy


Super cute casual spring / summer dress. I'm 5'4" 127 pounds and the medium fits perfectly. Hits just under my knees.


This dress is really cute. Fits well and is true to size. Perfect for spring and summer
