I am 5'5", 175 pounds, and I tend to carry my extra weight in my tummy and breasts (38D). The large fits like a glove! It is stretchy, breathable, has a nice flowy feel, and comes down to just below the knee. It doesn't ride up when I sit down, making me feel like I need to wear undershorts for modesty. My husband says it makes me look pretty and feminine -- not in the least bit frumpy like some dresses can make me look. I'll be buying more.


I am 5' 5" tall and wear 34a bra size with a waist of 26 inches and hips of 38. I ordered the large Navy Peony colour since I like a little room and this is for wearing at home. Fabric is good. In terms of the size chart a small would have been my size but I know if I did order that size it would have been too tight. I would say order one size up from your measurements of the product sizing. A medium would have fit me best.


REALLY cute super soft dress. I'm usually a medium (I'm busty 31" waist, 5'9") but according to the size chart I was supposed to be a large. I ordered a large and it was really loose and unflattering around the waist. I'm planning to try ordering a medium next, but a little nervous that it will still be too loose.


First of all this dress is very very stretchy and soft! I ordered my usually size large and it was very big and that never happens with dresses. Returning was no problem and I got medium. Strangely is still a bit too big .... but Iâ€™m buying a belt to do with it so it should fit fine then. I still like it and wore it. Itâ€™s a long dress too but flattering In the tummy area but Iâ€™d like a tighter fit on top. I might try to order another dress a size smaller and seeing if that fits better. Overall, I got lots of compliments!


This is a cute dress. I ordered the sunflower pattern and it get lots of compliments on it at work. I'm 5'6", about 155 and 36-38D. It is longer than i expected, and hits a couple inches below my knees. I usually prefer a shorter hemline, but it's good for these winter months anyway.  I have a smaller waist and it's a little big there, otherwise it fits well. The fabric is soft, but the black has faded a little in the few times i've washed it. Maybe consider hand washing, or using a gentler soap than i have in that past. Overall, it's a great dress and i'm looking into a couple other colors


This dress is the perfect choice for any occasion. It fits like a dream. If you happen to be on the borderline in sizing (chest/waist), however, I would recommend ordering the next size up. Simply LOVE this dress and the price makes it a fantastic bargain!


Great basic little dress. Super soft material. Was a little longer than I expected. They said it was 36 inches but it was more like 38 and 1/2. Fit just about knee length. I'm 5' 6 and 1/2 ". Haven't washed it yet so not sure how well it'll wash. Great price and shipped super quickly. You can dress it up with jewelry and a belt or wear it casual. It's really a great versatile dress, super comfy.


It fits great  thank you ! I love the material and the pink color! It's my 14 year of being a Breast Cancer Survivor!ğŸ¤—ğŸ™�ğŸ˜‡ğŸ‘�ğŸŒ¸


Very thin material you can definitely see through and well past my knee (5'5). IIf your'e between sizes order your smaller size. Description measurements aren't accurate. Website says 37' for a large, my dress measures 41'


Haven't washed this dress yet but so far, I love it!  Fits perfectly - I'm 36G & 5'4".  I have unsightly psoriasis on my knees so was hoping the dress would fall a little below them & it does. Very happy with this purchase, trying to justify buying one or two more! :)
