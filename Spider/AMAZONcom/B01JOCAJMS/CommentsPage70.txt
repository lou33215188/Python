This was a repurchase to  replace a smaller size  perfect fit now


We can make do, Thank you.


Bought this for a cosplay my daughter was doing.  The fit was great and the quality seems very good.


I chose to order a large based on reviews and size guide and it's too small.


Nice fit, can dress it up or down. Glag I ordered it.


Super cute and fits my 12 year old perfectly. She's 110kbs and 5'1". She's wearing size small and we added a belt.


Fit is great/  The colors are exactly as pictured.  I have already purchased two more dresses from them and have more planned for downtime road.  VERY comfortable too


This dress was too short in the waist for me but and overall it was long enough. I am 5'7" but I am long in the torso.


I love this dress! It's a tad bit longer than I'd like, but still super cute! I'm 5'8 125 lbs for reference. It comes a bit below my knees.


Runs Large
