This dress is gorgeous, comfortable, and flattering! Get it!


I first ordered the black dress. Based on the comments, I ordered an XXL. I normally wear a size 14/16 (depends) and considering other reviews, I was concerned that an XL would be too small. The upper portion of the dress fits well and the skirt is roomy and hides my problem area (tummy). It's a good quality but I haven't washed it yet so I will update this review after that. However, thus far, I like it for it's simplicity. It's a "no thought process" outfit. Just grab it, add some cute shoes and go. In fact, I bought two more that happened to be on sale (blue and multicolored). It's a casual dress but with a jacket or shrug and fancy shoes it can be dressed up a bit. I plan to wear them with a sweater and boots when it gets cool.


I purchased this dress in navy blue and pink and  they were exactly like the photographs on Amazon and really awesome. So I decided to buy the same exact dress in black and when I received the black dress it is absolutely not the same dress as the picture on the website and it is a completely different material length and design.  I can't understand how the black dress is completely different than the website picture and description and nothing like the other two colors. Much cheaper fabric and I hate it.


I initially bought this in a large, which fit perfectly everywhere except the bust. I returned it and went up a size and it fits the bust perfectly. Honestly, for an $18.99 dress, I am shocked at the quality and comfort.  It is very cute, very flattering, and an easy wear. You can dress it up or down and wear it all day without feeling uncomfortable. I liked it so much I bought a second one.


This dress is a gorgeous simple dress. It's hard to find a good modest dress that's not either super long or super short. This dress is it!! Modest, simple, no frills, perfect knee length dress. This can be worn casually as is or can be dressed up for church or a wedding with the simple addition of a cardigan, shrug, or scarf. Comes in gorgeous colors. I ordered the light Robin's Egg blue and the pastel lavender. These colors will be perfect for spring. And the price can't be beat! I will definitely be ordering more colors. Thank you Huhot for this amazing wardrobe addition and to Amazon for the fast shipping. I am definitely in love ğŸ˜� ğŸ‘�


Great casual dress. Doesn't wash very well, and stains easily, but stains don't show up much on the darker colors. It's great for layering, and can be dressed up or down for many occasions. For sizing: I'm 5'5" and weight 230 lbs; it falls to just above my knee, and size 2X fit perfectly and is very flattering. Neckline is very modest, material is light and comfortable. It's a very good dress to keep for one or two seasons, but I wouldn't expect it to last much longer than a year, depending on how you treat it. Overall, I really like this dress, and have bought it in multiple colors because it's such a good price.


I just received my dress today-i ordered the red peony floral (black background) in a size xxl, based on other customer's recommendations. For reference,  I'm 5'5, 198lbs, 44C, and typically wear a size 16/18W. This dress actually fit very nicely and accentuates all the right curves,  while at the same time,  hiding problem areas. This dress hits right below my knee- which is exactly where i wanted it to be. Only complaint is that the fabric is very thin/see-through, however this is nothing that a black slip cant fix. I will say that if you add a belt,  it really takes the look up a notch.  The seams/sewing of this dress arent the best-but for under $20 you get what you pay for, so i didnt have high expectations on this when i ordered it. If  you happen to be familiar with the Lularoe Nicole dresses-this is a good bargain for a similar silhouette, and the fabric is just as soft as the Nicole. Hope this review helps. Overall great,  vibrant dress for a great price!


LOVE this dress. It is going to be my "teacher uniform" when I start teaching. During the winter I'll add leggings. It hits just below the knee on me (5' 4" - long legged and short torso, fairly skinny, 115 lbs). It fits perfect and looks nice. Very pleased. This one (the beige peony) is a polyester or something. Dries quickly when laid flat/hung. I'm not going to put it in the dryer so it lasts longer. I bought 3 or 4 of these dresses and it seems some are cotton + spandex and some are polyester or nylon or some synthetic. I'll come back and edit after I read the tag.


Perfect! A little big but looks great. I'm 5'5" and 226lbs. It washed nicely and I hung to dry.


A good basic dress for most occasions. I am 5'2" and 200 lbs, ordered the xl to be on the safe side. I could have gone with just a large but it would have been clingy. This dress is great for work because the neckline isn't too low and my shoulders are covered. On me it falls a few inches below the knee. Easy to dress it up with a jacket and nice shoes. Easy to move in when you're lifting heavy files or rooting under your desk for a dropped cord. I will probably order another one after I wear this a few times to be sure I like it.
