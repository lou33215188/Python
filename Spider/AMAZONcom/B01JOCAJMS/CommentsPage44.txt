i new it would run small bought a larger size. color is very beautiful.


Too big, and the neck is very unflattering. It feels like an oversized  long tshirt.  Pretty color though

Great dress!! I love it! Iâ€™m going to buy it in several different colors/patterns.


I got this dress to travel with, speak at events and wear to nicer or more casual events (depending on what necklace and jewlrey/scarf I wear). It fit as expected and works perfectly!


I read the reviews on this dress and bought a size larger and it fit just right.  I gave it a 4 because I really didn't realize that it is just like a T-shirt. At least the material is. I did get lots of good comments on how it looked.


Bought this to wear to my daughter 'Peppa Pig' theme party. I also expecting so it fitted well ( wasn't too short ) & comfortable.


I am 5'3" and bought a large. The dress went past my knees so I'm going to need to have it shortened. I like that the sleeves actually cover the upper arms. I gave 4 stars because the material is very thin. I wore leggings and a tight tank top underneath. I'm not sure I'll be able to wear this in the sun.


wear with capri leggings as it is too short for me to wear alone.


I got this in grass green for a Louise Belcher costume, and it fits perfectly. Looks perfect!


This dress is so cute.  Im 5'3", curvy and ordered an XL.  It falls just below the knee.  The cut is great, the short sleeves are a good length, the stitching and design of this dress seem to be well done.  I wore it to work with a cardigan, black tights and heels and was super comfy all day.  I will likely be ordering more of these in the future.
