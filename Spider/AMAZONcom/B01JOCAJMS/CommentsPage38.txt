I love the cut and length of this dress. Covers all the unflattering areas while accentuating the feminine silohette. I wish the neckline was a little fancier than the T-shirt like hem, but still a super cute, casual dress. I bought the black for versatility and am pleased with the color (black black, not blue black or grey-ish).


Perfect doesn't describe this dress. Honestly, I purchased simply from the reviews and few pictures. Crossed my fingers and wahlah. I truly suggest this dress for women of all shapes and sizes. Be sure to consider your measurements when ordering. It's true to size. I will post pictures later.


It is so small and the fabric is transparent. I returned it immediately.


Like the fact that It's comfortable, and can wear it with a tan shrug I have.  Can go anywhere in this dress.


This is not a dress- this is a moo moo.


The color is exactly as pictured and the material is extremely soft and comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it's very long. Went well below my knees. I'm 5'1 so keep that in mind if your petite.


Item exactly as pictured.  The printed dresses are a little more flimsy, so I would recommend wearing leggings underneath after a few washes.


The fabric is a little weird and fleecy and the skirt isn't as full as I hoped. But it's good enough to wear!


I bought 4 dresses and they all were true to their size. I have also washed them and they wash and dry great. Love the dress style, length and material. Good product.


This dress came in and looks just like the picture. I bought a large based on the reviews. I would normally wear a 10-12 in a dress. The material is stretchy. I falls just above my knees, I am 5'3". It's cute.
