Super soft and quality material!!


Just doesn't flatter me.  Wasn't what I was looking for.


This dress does not it look on Amazon


I purchased the navy blue with the lighter flowers in a large. It didn't quite fit as I'd hoped - I'm larger, but not terribly busty, and the fabric stretched the print all kinds of awkward over the chest. The fabric was MUCH thinner than I anticipated - you could see through it, so, not a good idea for work. Maybe 20 years ago.


Seemed made well. Liked the length. Just fit awkwardly on my rounder frame.


Fits as expected.


I was do excited to order this dress as it looks old fashioned and covers more for wearing to school as a teacher. However, I am extremely disappointed in how the product actually is. First off, it is a thin and very cheap fabric. The dress is longer than expected as well. When trying on the dress, I have to say it is very disappointing on how it fits and shows underneath. I will be using the fabric to probably make something else or donating this to good will.


Color: beautiful dusty rose;


Fit: as I expected using sizing chart;


Fabric: substantial weight, but when I bent over to put my shoes on, it wrinkled. By the end of my work day, I decided it is usable for house dress.


It looked as tho I had slept in it. So disappointed, not suitable for professional setting. Glad I did not pay much for it.


Disappointed as the dress is not a "midi" as described, hits above the knee. The quality of material less than expected. Would not recommend this item to a friend.


Dress is very cute but see through. Disappointed


Too short in length for my taste.
