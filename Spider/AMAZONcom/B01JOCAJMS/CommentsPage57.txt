Very cute dress! Nice shade of green. Fits well and looks nice. Comfortable to wear.


My daughter loves it.


Their sizing is off.


Very flattering! Great price...would recommend to go up a size, because it shrinks...not surprising..it is cotton, but good for warm weather.


The material was pretty thin, as expected, but suuuuper soft. I unfortunately had to return it because I'm 5' and it was a little longer than mid-calf, which is an awkward length on me.


So soft!! I ordered a bunch of dresses and this was the only one I kept! It is incredibly soft and forgiving.  Not too tight, not too loose.  Hits right below the knees.  I love it!


My daughter loves it.


LOVE! I'm so pleasantly surprised by this dress. The price was great. It fits perfect and it's so flattering. I love the material. For reference I ordered med and I'm 5'4 117lbs


Too short. Waist on the wrong place. I'm 5'7" and the waist is neither on my natural waist nor as empire. No idea why all dresses being sold recently are with these weird placed waist seams.


I never write reviews, but I LOVE this dress!  I'm 5' 4" 135 lbs bought a size S and this dress is super flattering! It's beautiful but comfortable enough to wear it around the house as a stay at home mom. It's like LulaRoe's Nicole dress but way less money. I'm about to buy a few more... can't beat the price.
