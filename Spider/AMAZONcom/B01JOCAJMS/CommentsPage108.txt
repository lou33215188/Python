This is going to be a great staple piece to my summer stock of dresses for work.  It is jersey, but heavy enough to not be "sticky."  I don't need my spanx waistband showing!  The color is very vibrant and the pleating is very forgiving.  I am 5'6 and 160lbs- very muscular build.  I have a hard time finding dresses that are form fitting up top, but more forgiving at the bottom- this dress is just that!


Great dress, super cute, and easy to pack for a quick get away.


My wife said the fit was perfect, but it has a few strings that needed trimming.


Sleeves were a bit tight, fabric not a soft as anticipated. But a nice shape and dress.


Love it! Just the right stretch. Knee length. Comfy. The BEST.


The dress is so comfortable. I will be purchasing more.


So comfortable and soft!  I wear a size 6-8 and got a medium that fits just right.


It is very nice but the fabric is very thin- would work more as a slip than dress


Received today amd love but very bummed because it has a stain around the collar.


It is about two sizes too small.  Like the color and the material.
