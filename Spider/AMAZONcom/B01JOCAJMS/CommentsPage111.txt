This dress looks expensive....the fit is excellent and the fabric washes beautifully.


Love the dress!  Can be dressy or casual!  Love the feel of the fabric.


Loved the material and feel of this dress; and donâ€™t have to dry clean!


I did not read the fabric label correctly and thought the weight of fabric would be heavier.


I should have ordered the Medium but it's not too tight that I can't wear it. I will most likely order another color in a Medium.


Perfect summer t-shirt dress. Love the fit and flare.


Cute dress but could not wear my normal size. Was too small.


Love the fabric it's soo soft!! I'm normally a large but I ordered xlarge and it fits perfect!!


Very cute and easy to wear


I bought this along with the white retro kitchen restaurant flirty women apron for my 12 year old daughter's role as a servant in a 1930's musical production.  She is 5'3", 100lb and ordered the small.  It fits her well (not snug but not loose), to her knees.  Perfect for the role.  Next year she can be a 1930's servant for Halloween!
