Beautiful.  Didn't want to take it off.


So many compliments on this dress! Super cute.


It is for petit women


Nice fit and very comfortable.


i am 5'3", 41-33-41. and have a hard time with getting a good fit. the XL is just a tad tight in the bust and a tad loose in the waist. not enough that anyone else would notice. it is a casual dress, tee-shirty, but could be dressed up if needed. it falls an inch or two below my knees.the arms and shoulders fit me well (average).  it is soft and comfy-shows no cleavage, and is conservative enough to wear anywhere. Love it. I'm ordering another soon.


Wonderful dress


The waist cut is a little too high up but I still like it


Not my favorite fabric but a good dress


Comfortable to wear,fits petfectly.can be worn with sandals or heels.


Sending back.  Too small.
