nice deal


Runs small. Thought itwuld be brighter green. It is more of a dark forest green. Decent material. Not much stretch. Cotton.


Comfortable fit and fabric.


Nice dress. Good quality and material. Colors are more vibrant than expected, but very pretty. I plan on buying more.


Absolutely love this dress! So cute and stylish-and I can wear it between work and a night out because it's just that versatile. Highly recommend! The only reason I gave it a four star rating is because the fabric it a bit too thin for my comfort. Otherwise, it's a beautiful dress!


I'm 5'8" around 230lbs; I ordered an XXL because I have a bigger bust and it is perfect! The dress fits my body in the right ways, and it isn't too short. I'm definitely considering purchasing another dress in a different color.


It fits soo well (Iâ€™m hourglass shaped). It comes down to the knew and is easy to dress up or down. I keep getting a ton of compliments when I wear it - Recommended!


Very cute dress. I have received many compliments when wearing it. The fabric has gotten a little woren looking after 4-5 washes.


This dress is a terrific buy! Even though the fabric is a little on the thin side (I'd buy a darker color or a print), the style is on trend and it's also super comfortable! I wore it for my son's baby dedication with a statement necklace and got several compliments. I'm 5 foot 3 in. and weigh 127 pounds, and the small fit very well.


Very comfortable, well made, I'm 5'5" and it falls just to the top of my knee. Greatctravelnor casual dress. The fabric is lightweight and stretchy bit not ser-through. Feels a little cadual fir work but a good tracel and summer dress.
