Super comfortable dress. It fit just as expected. I'm 5' 120lbs so the small fit perfectly. The length came right below the knee but that was expected. Perfect for a bridal or baby shower!


I am 5'4 and weigh about 130 pounds and usually wear a size 4. I ordered the medium, erring on the side of caution, and I am sorry I didn't follow the size chart. So going to get the small now. The medium reached me just past my knees.


Comfortable, flattering, and nice length! The fabric is soft and the colors are great! Planning to buy a few more in different colors/patterns.


So comfortable! I got size medium. I'm 5'4" and 140lb. Fits perfectly and the length is below the knee which is a cute modest look. A dress I will wear all the time.


Very comfortable, a little thin, but good quality. I am 5'2'' and 118 lbs, ordered the small, and I had to get mine taken in at the waist.


I'm 5'5, and about 170 lbs and this was a bit loose on me at an XL. Extremely comfortable though and it hits right below my knees.


Love the floral colors and the fabric is perfect weight for summer. The fit is perfect, I ordered a large, I am 5'6 and weigh 150. The reason I didn't give 5stars is that it's 2 inches shorter than the one I ordered earlier and I like the longer length. It is a great go to dress!!


Feels nice. Very stretch and light. I’m 5’ 6” 185 lbs 38C. Got the XL and aside from wishing it was just a tiny bit shorter I really like it. Will look nice with heels or casual shoes I think. A little thin may need a tank under it or at least nude or white under clothes.  Might size down to a large if I reorder


This dress is really see through!! I bought the large but this fits more like a XL!!


Nice dress, normally I wear a medium but as a precaution ordered a size up. Glad that I did.
