This is one of the best products I have ever bought on Amazon or online. I love it.


Absolutely love it!


I should've ordered a size up since this will shrink when washed but I do love it


It’s very long, past my knees. I’m 5’3”. But it’s cute!


Very cute fit and nice color blue!  I hope it washes well.  I wear an 8 and the M fits well now but if it were any tighter I would have exchanged for L.


SIZE fit my torso and arms. But it’s too long. I’m 5’2” and had to get it hemmed 4” because it went past my knees.


This will be great for Fall.  So comfortable and great, soft material.


Unflattering cut


Material stretchy very long im 53 and goes past my knees. Not pleaded as shown in picture just lays flat.


I'm 5'2" 120 lbs and the small fits perfect. The material is soft and super comfortable. Im obsessed with the floral pattern. Get this dress!!
