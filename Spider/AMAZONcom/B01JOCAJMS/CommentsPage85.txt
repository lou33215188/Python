Super cute dress, I would order it again in other prints.


Super soft and stretchy. Delivered on time!


Great fit!! Super comfortable and easy to dress up for work!! Will definitely be buying more!!


The solid color pink dress fit entirely different than the patterned one with stars. The patterned dress was super soft and fit perfectly. The solid colored dress was an uncomfortable and heavier stretchy fabric that was much tighter. Returned it.


It's a little tight but I will keep it.


Did not like the material but still good.


Bought this dress in three different colors!  Stylish, modest and comfortable for summer time!


This dress is so comfortable and dressy enough to be considered business casual. I'm actually planning to wear it to a summer wedding.


It fits wonderfully and is soft like a shirt. I'm 5'5 and a large lands right below my knee.


It was still a nice dress.
