It was okay. I carry my weight up top, this wasn't flattering for that shape. Does not camouflage a belly


The dress is way longer then it appears which is nice. It went way past my knees. It's exactly as pictured, Tight at the top and lose on the bottom, My only problem is the whole thing feels like a large t-shirt. Worked better for me as a painters smock dress or but would work as a great sleep dress.


fabric doesn't last with washing. it faded quickly and


has small lint pieces on it after two washings.


I get a ton of compliments. Fits great and is comfortable. Would buy again and recommend to others.


Fit, but showed entirely too much! Gave it away to someone smaller.


I purchased this to have a simple, modest summer dress and it is perfect. I am petite pear shaped, 5 feet tall, small or medium top and size 6 bottom. I purchased a medium. It is a comfortable fit with some stretch and the length goes below my knees.


Cute dress - I would like to have more prints in this style.


Cute and comfy! Ordered this dress in yellow for a custome party... Joy from inside out. Received several compliments on the style of the dress. It is very comfortable and fits well. I do have to wear an under shirt which I don't like doing.. but I think if it was a darker color it would be fine. Overall worth the buy! Thinking I'll order in black!


Awesome dress! Beautiful pattern and fabric, very flattering for my hourglass body type. Swooshy as I wanted! Great quality.


A little see through but a great light weight dress.
