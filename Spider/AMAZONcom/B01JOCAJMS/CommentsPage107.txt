I love this dress!  So comfortable, nice flare and shape and the price was amazing.


I'm 5'9" and this is the perfect knee length dress! Really cute and the material doesn't feel super cheap.


My favorite dress for work! I get compliments every time I wear it. Very comfortable!


Love, Love, LOVE this dress. It fits perfect I am 5â€™2. & 170 pounds, I ordered an XLG & it is perfect


Really like this dress alot. Can dress it up or down. So comfortable and it gets lits of complements.


It's amazing! Cool, cottony feel. Perfect for summer. A little thin but nothing a slip can't fix.


The color is more of a mossy green than vivid, jewel green


This had a really nice soft feel and was comfortable but unfortunately just a little tight so I returned it. I would purchase again just order a size bigger


Wore this to a bridal shower. Everyone loved it! Looks really good w/a denim jacket.


I fluctuate between a medium/large so I ordered a XL - not sure if it was the material but it did not fit true to size!
