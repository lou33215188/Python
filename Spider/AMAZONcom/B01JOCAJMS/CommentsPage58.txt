Don't expect to get this overnight.  Other than that, the Navy is black on top with a navy skirt.  Still looks very nice together.


I sent it back because it was too small. I really loved the dress and will re-order a size up.  I'd like to say it runs small, but it might just be me


Material a little thin and runs a little small.  But I like way it looks and can dress it up or down.


A little tighter in the arms and shoulders than the other dresses of the same size/cut.  Still very pretty and flattering.  Perfect summer dress.


i love that its cotton


Nice product


Thanks love it!


Great dress for the price,  I am 5'8 150, 36c and large fit perfectly.  The black looks great.


Super comfy!


Nice quality
