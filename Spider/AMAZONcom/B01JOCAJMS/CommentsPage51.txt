Perfect summer dress! Fits great, just the right length, flattering, comfortable. Perfect for around the house or a nice occasion! Will buy more!


I get a lot of compliments about the dress. It is stylish, fits great and I absolutely love it.


i just recieved mine..so far i like it..its comfortable.


i ordered size small (i am only 5ft tall and 106.4 lbs)


When i ordered it it was $18.99 and just now its $13.57ğŸ˜…


This is a very thin dress. May need a slip if you're going to be in the sunlight.  It's also smaller than expected.


Very pretty dress but the top was too tight. I had to return it. You might want to order a size larger than you usually wear.


Dress is beautiful! I measured before I ordered and itâ€™s too small.


I am only 5'3 and the Medium was very short waisted, had to return  item


soft, washes well, dries with no wrinkles


Absolutely love it!!!! So cute! Hangs perfectly on me.


My daughter said the dress was fine.  Haven't seen it on her yet though.
