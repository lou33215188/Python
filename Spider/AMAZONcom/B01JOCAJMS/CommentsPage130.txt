I love the dress but I ordered the rose and received the light pink.


Super cute and comfortable! Fast delivery as well ... I got this dress in green, size medium.  I'm 5ft2, 125lbs and it fit just right ... fell to right below my knees , didn't cling below my rib cage which is great! No belly bulge or panty lines to worry about.  Material is lightweight but not see through.  I haven't washed/dried it yet but I'm guessing if it's washed in cold water and hung up to dry it shouldn't shrink.  You do have to lightly iron /steam it as it did come wrinkled from being folded up.  I like that it can be easily dressed up or down , much like a nice tee shirt can. Great purchase:))


Fits great! Looks great!


this dress is nice and comfortable


Bought my wife a large, and she normally wear medium. Fits well, though she couldn't wear it without a belt: It would poof out too much. If you are petite but normally wear a medium, you may be able to get by. Not high quality but not terrible. You get what you pay for and this is no-name, made in China. It's great for every day wear. I think my wife looks really cute in it. She's 5'7" and 130lbs, for reference.


Beautiful. Material somewhat thinner than expected.


Very nice fit and good material.


Just right and bright, :)


So cute, flattering and comfortable.


Simple and easy!
