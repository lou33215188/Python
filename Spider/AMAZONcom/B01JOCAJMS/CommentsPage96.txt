Very comfortable. Like the material very much and the cut of the dress. Got lots of compliments.


A lightweight, clean, well fitting dress.  I plan to wear it as is and also throw a sweater over it.


Like the quality and cut of the dress. Reordered size larger


I really liked the color. it was true to picture.


The fit was too clinging. I didn't like how the waistline fit.


Fit smaller then expected. But otherwise it would have been a cute dress.  I will reorder next size up.


I got an XL. It fit everywhere else but it was tight in the chest and arms. It's super cute though. My advice Is get a size up if you have big boobs. Oh, and the seam was undone at the stomach


The material is super thin, I could see my tattoo through the side of the dress.  Also the sizes seem to run a little big. Had to send back. Cute print though.


Fits a little looser than expected but I really like it.  I received compliments.  Good quality material.


It fits well and the fabric is light and comforable


Nice dress over all. I like the feel of the fabric.
