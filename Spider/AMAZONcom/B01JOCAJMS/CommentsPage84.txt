This dress fits really nicely and compliments the figure quite well. Its super soft cotton and does not fade. I've washed it several times and it still looks new.


Good color. Good length. No ruching like pictured, it’s just a flare from the waist out. Not flattering on me, not what I wanted. Will be returning.


I am in love with these dresses. The sizing runs TTS and they are comfortable and super flattering. I own 5 or 6 of this dress and am always looking for new colors.


Great dress. Fit is amazing. Super flattering and modest. 5’6” and 130lbs small fits just right.


Daughter loved the dress and the bright color. She asked to get more colors and i will purchase.


Horrible fabric that faded and became aweful looking after one wash done while following instruction on the garment.  Do not purchase this product.


Love this dress! Great for the price.


Purchased for a Halloween costume. Was a lot longer than I anticipated.


Great material but I bought a large and it was huge on me.


I usually wear and xs. 5'4 105 lbs. I got a small because they don't have xs. It's a little loose on me but it's a great dress. Simple to dress up or down. Perfect work dress (teacher). Can't beat it for the price. I'll probably order every color.
