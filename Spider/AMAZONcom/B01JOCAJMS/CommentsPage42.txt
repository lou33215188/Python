The color isn't as pretty as the picture. The length was awkward on the leg.


This dress is lovely!


I'm 5'6'' and 210 lbs and the dress fits perfectly with the end of it falling to my knee.


The material feels super soft and breathable which makes it very cozy (which is great for people like me who live in a place with hot weather).


This might not be my favorite dress I own(though its pretty high up there) but as far as comfort goes its the most comfortable one in my wardrobe.


Very pleased with this purchase!


The waist was too high and the material was very thin.  Would not recommend


Great fit, nice soft feel. I liked this one so much I ordered 2 more different colors.


I’m 6’ tall and 159 lbs.


I ordered a medium and I’m very happy with the fit!


Super soft dress and even though its a clingy material it fit great and was still modest in length.


It's so cute, sexy and comfortable.  I am not a small person either.  Fits well.


I didn't like this dress, too long and neck part too high. I'm disappointed


Dress was slightly smaller than expected. Overall very comfortable and love the fabric. I will be ordering more in more colors.


Love these dresses! Bought in black and green! I will admit i do think sometimes sizing can be a bit strange, as i bought both in L, but i feel as if the green dress hugs me just a little bit better than the black. The dresses are a good quality, and cute while modest. I wore these as casual as date night, to Christmas with my boyfriends family! Wonderful because they can be dressed up or down. Def considering buying other colors to be honest.
