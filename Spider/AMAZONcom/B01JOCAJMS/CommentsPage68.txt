Adorable dress! It's cotton, light & airy and the print is perfect for spring/summer. I'm 5'5" and 205lb and the large fits great! (Hope this helps ğŸ˜‰) I definitely recommend this dress!


Very disappointed with the ultra-thin material. Returned it.


This is very nice and feminine.


I chose the size based on the measurements of the size chart. The waist is a little higher than I expected, but I have a big check that is probably lifting the waist line some. The material is soft, but also feels thick and like it will be durable. Totally happy with this purchase.


I liked it but it was too long for my liking so I'm returning it. I'm just giving it 4 stars because it's long. Beautiful material, well made, etc.


Fit my wife perfectly, and made a perfect Pikachu Halloween costume.  She's a 4th grade teacher, and her kids loved it.


Very casual and comfortable to wear.


Returnedâ€” did not match image at all.


It was cute and its just probably me!


fits great nice material love the pattern
