beautiful dress right size chart.


Perfect fit and have had many compliments.


Comfortable, flattering. I got several compliments wearing it.


Great fit! Knee length...I did expect a little shorter. Its bottom of the knee. But I love it.


I just bought this for my wife and she likes it a lot. It fits her well and it has a lot of potential for different outfits and color combinations.


Fits great. I am 5’8” and it’s hard to find dresses that aren’t to short. This dress is great for work. I already plan on purchasing more.


Good dress. Just buy a size up and you'll be fine. Very comfy, but pills easily.


Inexpensive. Fits perfect. So soft and comfy.


So comfortable and adorable. Yellow is slightly sheer, but not noticeable with nude undergarments.


I liked the color, but I didn't like how long it was on me, I'm on the petite side so I thought getting an xs would be best to purchase.
