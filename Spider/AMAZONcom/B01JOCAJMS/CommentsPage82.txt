This is the second dress purchased in this same line, just a different print.  This purchase is a size larger than the dress I purchased before even though it is marked the same size.


I keep getting compliments and it's really comfortable. I have the green and it looks as pictured.


Stretchy, true to size, only a little transparent.


This is my second Short Seeve Round Neck Summer Casual dress.  I ordered it in Navy Blue.  It is so comfortable and fits so well, I ordered another in Black.  I highly recommend it.


Very comphy


I am 5' 4" and I think it should say tea length since it came below my knees. Top is not made for busty women either.


A cute dress for a very short person.  It's also very short waisted.  The waist comes 2 inches above my natural waist and the hem about 2 inches above my knees..  I am long waisted and about 5'5", 130 lbs.  A medium would probably fit better but still be too short waisted and too short at the him.  I like a dress at least knee length or 1" below the knee.  If it fit it would have been a very useful dress - great for travel.


A little light weight but will be great for next summer.


Suuuper cute dress! It was what i was expecting.


Very fresh and confortable to wear. It is like a casual dress but if you add a blazer could work for an office outfit.


Check your stitching mines is bad in back of the dressğŸ˜‰
