I love this dress. I would order more in other colors if I could. The fit was perfect, the style very flattering, the fabric soft and flowing. Love it


this product fits a little larger if you think you should get a medium...get a small. Material slightly see thru.


Fits exactly they way it's pictured.


Perfect for a hot day


Nice little summer dress!


This dress was a little smaller in the chest area than the normal XXL.


Started pilling after wearing one time, cute on


I am a bigger girl and this dress looks great on me and is so comfortable!  I usually wear a size 16 and order a size XL and it fit perfect!


Don’t get what’s the point of selling a damaged item. I was really excited for this dress and now I’m extremely disappointed.


I love this dress. Fits perfect! So cute! I'm 5'5 and hits at knee length. I weigh 135 lbs and got a medium and it's perfect.
