Fits great!  It is a little longer than I expected it to be, but I bought a large to fit my bustier frame, so it makes sense.  The length doesn't look bad and the dress is very comfortable, so I may buy it in other colors.


Nice fit, very comfortable. One of those go to pieces of clothing you can dress it up or down. Plan to buy more in other colors for the summer.


Adorable. Perfect lightweight dress for the Florida weather. Well made and fit perfectly. Would definitely recommend.


Beautiful dress


I get compliments every single time i wear this dress! It fits great, the length is perfect. Super cute dress. I went back and bought it in another pattern.


Fits great! I'm 5'8 and 155lbs and the medium fit well and is comfortable.


Like it but it is a little thin.


cute


Love love love!!!


I love it so much. If I could give it 100 stars I would. It fits and looks nice too. I'm 5'11" and it fits me.
