Very comfy dress. ..got lots of compliments!


Love this dress! I'm 4'11" and 106lbs. I usually wear a 4 and this fit just as expected. Fabrics isn't too thick or think and the seams are well made. Several people complemented me on this dress!


Cute dress


Love this dress! I'm always afraid to buy "cheap" clothes on Amazon for fear of fit and quality. But for the price, this is a great buy! Fits true to size. I'm 5'5", 150lbs and a medium was great.


Fantastic dress! Im short and chubby but this dress makes me feel the opposite! I got an XL and it's a little loose, but that's preferred. Ordered two and plan on getting another.


Great dress! Fits well and looks pretty. I get lots of compliments everytime I wear this out. Be careful to wash this with anything fuzzy as this picks up all the long, flyaways, etc. you can imagine.


Faded after a couple of washes


I wear large to extra large dresses, depending on cut. I ordered an extra large to be on the safe side. The sleeves and bust were too tight.


nice black dress


i love this dress.. cute pattern, flattering cut, fabric is a bit thin, but looks fine with a slip underneath. iâ€™ll be buying more
