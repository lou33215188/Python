The length was good. I am 5'7" 184 lbs. . I am too busty in this dress . It made me look trampy.


shorter than expected and I'm not tall. color is nice.


nice dress for anything really lays nice on the body nice for summer occassions


Fit very nice and like to color


too long for a person 5'2 goes to my mid calf.  print is ok kinda dull


This dress is great! It fits well and feels twirly and flirty just like I wanted it to. However, I am only 5'2" and this dress hits me about mid calf. It's a bit longer than I wanted it to be, and I will probably alter it myself. If you're looking for a dress that's more modest in the leg, this would be a great option!


Prety i love


Perfect! The color is great and the fit is just perfect and very flattering.


Will order again . My daught


I love both the thickness and the feel of this dress.  The size chart was perfect and fit as expected.
