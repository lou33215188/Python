Love this dress! It's so soft and comfortable, just like wearing a nightgown. I get tons of compliments when I wear it.


So comfortable.. Like putting on a really soft second skin and is good quality... It is not see through and I wear it to work and around during the summer and beginning of fall... I love this so much!!


Love it!  I received a ton of compliments;  however,  the material can be a little see-through when stretched.  At the bust, I had to be a little careful about what bra I chose since I am large chested and certain ones would show.


It's thin but it fits great!


Love this dress! It is a tad bit longer than I expected but it is adorable. This is perfect for all occasions! I can't wait to wear this to work!  I am 5ft 5" and 155lbs. I bought a medium and I am glad I did!


Very nice for the price!


Love the ğŸ‘— dress!


Got so many compliments. I love it. It may be long on shorter women I am 5'7 and it was perfect for teaching not to short or too long. Very comfy and flattering.


Fit great, little on the see through side.


I am ordering more colors I love it.
