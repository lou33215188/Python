I am 5'11" and 175 lbs, and the xlarge fits wonderfully. It hits just below my knee, and is amazingly flattering. Modest, functional, and pretty are hard to find when you're built like me--will def be buying more!


Worked perfectly for the purpose for which it was intended which was actually as the basis for an Alice in Wonderland costume. But really it is a nice little dress if you're looking for a simple dress. Seemed well made. Nice color.


The only reason I'm docking one star is how thin the material is but otherwise I love the fit, the pattern, and the comfort of this dress! Beautiful!


Nice fabric, but did return, front is so much longer than back, looks ridiculous.


This dress is perfect for summer!  If you have a somber occasion or an evening event, you can really dress this dress up!  I'm very happy with this dress!


Thin fabric and even ordering a larger size, was still too tight in the arms and bust (I am not very busty).  Waist was too high and didn't flow well either.  Returned it.


I really like it, the fit was nice. I am short so it feels a bit too long on me (5'2) other than that i'm hoping to order a few more in different colors.


Love this dress! It's breezy and very light. The only reason I'm rating a 3 is because it is too tight in my bust. I can still wear a jacket over it, but for a summer dress that's hard to do. I would have been willing to exchange, but they did not have a larger size in my favorite pattern.


It wasn't the right dress for my body. I'm 5'9, 165 lbs and I carry my weight in my stomach. The great thing is the free return, so it was no risk for me to give it a try.


I just got the dress. I love it. Will see how it washes. If it washes and no shrinkage I will order more! And give 5 stars.
