First one I ordered was just above my knees. Second two I ordered was about 3 inches shorter but with waistline the same, a bit above my natural waistline. I like them both, but not sure which I'll get next time I order.


Dresses are grossly mis sized.


It fits great.. I am 5'1 and 110 lbs but wish it was not so long..


My daughter felt this dress was not form fitting enough and very loose around the mid section. Length is great and material is okay.


Cute for work or casual.


Great dress, but I bought a large figuring sizing would be on the small side. Instead, true to size. A large was too large. Otherwise, beautiful dress.


My daughter loves it, fits well and soft to touch


Love this dress. It looks and feels great. So many of these types of dresses don't look good on me because I'm not as thin as a rail, but this one was flattering. It washes up good. I just put it on a delicate cycle and lay it flat to dry.


See through..but nice and light weight material


This dress runs extremely small. I ordered according to the size chart provided. Returning.
