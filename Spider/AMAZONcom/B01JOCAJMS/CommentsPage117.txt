Very thin material!!


Love this dress! It is comfy and true to size. Can't wait to wear it for family pictures.


The perfect little black dress!!!


ordered a medium, its huge. also came ordered in coffee/mustard stain on front.


Perfect.  Bright color, airy and light. Although next time I will order one size bigger.


My bust fits great, but the dress makes me look like I'm pregnant.  Will be sending back.


I've gotten so many compliments on this dress! It does look a little worn after one wash though.


Love the fit and it hits under my knee perfect for me to were  to church


I absolutely love this dress! I would recommend ordering up one size, which is what I did and it fits perfectly!


This will be a wonderful dress for summer, casual outings. It is comfortable, fits well, easy to accessorize!
