Absolutely love it!!! Itâ€™s so comfy and cute!!


Too long and not great quality.


Looks great


This dress is wonderful in every way! But, I need to tack it in at the waist a little. It's just a hair too large and with a stitch in place, it'll trim a curvier body as opposed to hiding it, but without stretching it tight across either. For reference, I'm a new mom, so I've got some curves going. The length is good, coming to just below my knees at 5'7". It feels super soft, there is a little bit of stretch to it, and the color is true to what's on the screen. It's not see-through even with dark-colored undergarments. I can't wait to wear this dress all spring and summer, and I may order another one in a darker tone for the fall and winter. I think I found my go-to dress.


im short (5'3") but top part is short wasted even for me


Very nice quality


I've never bought clothes online but I figured I would try my luck and I'm glad I did it fits perfectly


Fit perfectly and great value
