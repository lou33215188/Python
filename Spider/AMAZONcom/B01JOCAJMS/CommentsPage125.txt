I am 5'7" and this dress went past my knees.


Fits perfectly. Ordered size large. Form fitting and comfortable.


Good material for an everyday dress.


Very Thin and the waist didn't fit to the waist it just hung.


Love the dress, received more compliments on it than any other dress I own.


I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. I expected it to be too short and more cheaper looking - but found it fell below the knee (I am 5'2") and looked pretty good when worn. It fit very well too


My only call out is the fabric is a bit thin and I have to wear a slip under it and it is also a polyester blend which means it doesn't need pressing but it can be a bit warm to wear in hot weather. Considering the thinness of the fabric - I was not expecting to feel so warm in (I live in Sri Lanka which is a tropical country and has temperatures averaging in the 90's)


I do like the dress though and will be buying more colours


Love it , recieved lots of compilments!


Liked the dress, just too small, you didn't have size 1x, is what I needed.


I look more adorable


It's long, just the I way like it
