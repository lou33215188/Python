Not as fitted through the waist as I expected


I wore this dress today and got many compliments on it.  I'm thinking I might order another one in a different color!


I loved the dress


Dress what a great quality for the price. Bright colors and fit as expected. Wonderful product and will order from the seller again soon!


Great dress!  Fit perfect. I wear an 8 medium. I bought this in a large to be sure it wasn't snug.  I love it!  I have three different styles.


Fits good.  I really like it.  I like the fabric, it drapes nice.


This is maybe my favorite dress ever. It's really light material but well made.


Good quality and I loved the print, but was just a little too big and long.


Love this dress nice thick and soft. Stretchy! All around an amazing casual summer dress. Excellent price.


It was not flattering.  I have a slim shape and I looked like an Amish girl.  It was also coming apart at the seams so I returned it
