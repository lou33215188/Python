Great dress!  Very comfortable and can be dressed up or down.  I am 5' 6" and weigh about 130, the small fits perfectly.  I wish I could buy more colors but they are all out of stock now.


Fit way too small. I ordered 2x fits like a medium.


This can really dress up with accessories.


Kind of static-y; it sticks to itself and gets a little annoying to walk in.


Fits great. I am 5’7, 152 pounds and ordered a size large. Knee-length, so it’s great for taller girls.


Lightweight cute and soft


Same as other one 2 sizes to small


Fits great!  Flattering cut.  I have received so many compliments!  Great casual with sandals or heels to dress it up.


This dress is great. Soft, comfortable. I'm 5'10 and wear a US 16/18, the XL is perfect.


Love it! Second dress I ordered. They have so many colors. Nice flowy dress that you can wear to any occasion. Light weight. Fits well.
