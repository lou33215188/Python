Good buy. My wife has loved it so far and received many compliments. We ordered 2 more in different colors.


I LOVE this dress. I wear it as soon as it's clean every week. It's comfortable, beautiful, and versatile.


Navy peony size medium. Absolutely gorgeous dress, my 13 year old daughter is thrilled! She is 5 '2", 130 lb and very curvy. This dress is modest, extremely soft, and very flattering. Would definitely recommend the Navy Peony!


Bought small size for 110 lb, 5'6' with thin frame. Needs to be ironed to look nice after washed.  A bit snug in arms, across shoulders, otherwise cute, breezy, soft.


I looove this dress!! I'm rather short, so for me the dress is long, but I don't mind as it is so comfortable, flowy, modest, and very well made! Highly recommend this as it's a very good deal! I will be buying another :)


Too long, came horribly stained, looked worn out upon arrival.


Purchased this dress for my friend to wear to church and other events.  She likes the color, fabric and style.


Ok for extra dark dress. Can dress it up with jewerly or sweater. Could be a little bigger at bust line.


I ordered this dress for my halloween costume. It fit too snug even though I ordered it in a size larger than what I actually am. I could see every line and mark, even my belly button showed. Sleeves were to short as well. Not a fan.


The dress was fine, but bought for my 12 year old and she did not like the look.  Again, more preference, not what the dress actually is.  Totally perfect for plain black dress.
