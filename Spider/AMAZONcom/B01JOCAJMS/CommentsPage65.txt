would buy again


Ordered a large, I'm 5'7", 143 lbs, fit is tight and looks awful! I would never order again!!! You get what you pay for!!!


Very thin fabric, clings in a horrible way.


I'm impressed with the quality for the price of this cute casual dress. It's light but not sheer at all so it's great for spring and summer. I'm very busty (40h)and the XL dress fits great! I'm getting more in different colors!


I ordered according to reviews of the fit. I am 5'2" 162 pounds, wear a size 10 pant and medium or large top; so I ordered the Large and it fit perfectly.


One of my favorite dresses! Comfy and does not attract pet hair as badly as some knits


Returned


Nice summer dress, pretty design. I’m 5’6 and 110 lbs. the small fits nicely. Four stars because the fabric is thin (but soft) and there were some misc. threads hanging from the hem.


The dress fit perfect!  I wear a size 12, I bought a XL. It is just right. It is a soft knit but keeps it's shape. It is hard to tell the colors from the pictures. The flowers are shades of peach. I love it.


Lots of Complements
