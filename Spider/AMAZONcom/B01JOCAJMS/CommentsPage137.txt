Really pretty, but the  material says "100% polyester", which is not at all what the description says. The material feels like that cheap t-shirt nonsense that all China made dresses seem to be.


This dress seems like it will be good for a wash and a wear, but no more.


Edit: I've been very careful to wash this dress on delicate and line dry, to preserve the material. So far I've washed it twice and it seems to be holding up okay, so I changed my rating from 1 star to 3. It's pretty, and long and comfortable.


Very cute dress, especially for the price. Washes well too!


The dress was okay but it was huge!!! I'm normally a med or small so when I ordered the other colors thwith dresses were perfect this on however was too long... like down to my shins long... and it was wide... it looked like 2x large. The material was also cheaper than the other ones... really upset about this product.


Very soft. Good fit.  Simple dress for every day.


Does not look like a picture.


So nice! Flattering and comfortable.


Beautiful light weight summer dress.  The arms fit too tight. A little small.  Might just make it sleeveless.


Washes up nicely. Hang dry.


Dress was nice but too small


Fit perfect. Love it


Floral pattern is different than pictured but still cute. Fits great and is super comfy! I want more in different colors. I'm 5'8 135lbs and I ordered a small.
