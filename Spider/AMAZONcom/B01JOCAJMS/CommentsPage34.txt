This dress is fabulous. It is long enough to be modest, but not too long as to be awkward. It's sturdy l and is cut just right. I would definitely purchase again.


Ordered an XL and the arms where a little tight but not so much that it was noticeable to anyone other than me. The black is a true black and it fits well (except in the upper arm area). Comfortable and versatile.


The white floral is very thin - but it is still really cute with a slip. I will reorder in a darker color for sure.


Very good fit, falls above the knee, I wanted my knee covered, but I will add a cotton trimming. The material is very simple cotton, like t-shirts, but very good for the price.


Adorable dress, but it is completely see through. I could tell as soon as I took it out of the package. I bought a slip to go under it that works but it would look and fit so much better if the material were just a little less transparent. Beautiful design though.


Fits perfectly. Skirt has nice swing and flows away from the body right where you want it to. I am 5'4 and curvy so I got an XL to be safe. The color was always exactly as shown in the picture. I got the navy with turquoise flowers


Very soft and comfy. Just right thickness (not too heavy, not too thin). Pretty design. Doesn't emphasize bulges.


I love it! I am VERY hesitant to order clothing online, but since I could return this item for free, I took a chance. I absolutely love it! It fit me perfectly! ( I'm 5'6; 145 lbs....& I purchased a Medium.) It's not too thick, not too thin...it feels great against my skin, & I will be ordering at least one more, & if not two or three!ğŸ˜Š


I am 5'10" with 36C bust size. I ordered size Large. It is a little snug in the arm pits but for the most part, I am happy with this item.


This dress was very nice ,but I returned it because I looked bad in it. This wasn't the dress fault ,it's my body !!
