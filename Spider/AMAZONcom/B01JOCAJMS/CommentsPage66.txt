A little thin and see through but no worse than expected for the price. Comfy and flattering. Runs a bit small but not too bad.


Fits great. Fabric is good quality. Love the color.


Material poor after wash


im 5'6" 145 pounds and the medium fits like a dream. it's super soft and flattering.  I will be purchasing more colors


Colors are bright and pretty, fabric is soft and somewhat stretchy, the only negative is that it is clingy, shows my "love handles" other than that the fit is great and I am pleased with this product


Ordered an XL and it fit how I expected it to. I am 5'9" about 200lbs and the stretchy material makes it fit snug but comfortably.


Perfit fit! I would suggest that you go with your size that you are now. :)


Nice but runs large and it is long


Very flattering fit! Love it!


Very comfortable dress, a go to that can be dressed up or down! I'm 5'9 and this sets right on top of my knees!
