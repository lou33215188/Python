Order this dress in black and was very please with it.  Thicker that I thought it would be, which was a pleasant surprise. Wore it work and received a lot of compliments.  Order 4 more in different colors:  navy, white, orange and pink.


I love the texture and it flared my figure. Since a midi dress is suppose to fall halfway between knee and ankle, and I am 5'4", I am planning to rock this dress by wearing  strapped heeled sandals. That way it will elongate my legs and combat the stumpy look a midi dress gives.


My favorite dress ever!!


Ordered Numerous styles of this dress. The plain color (I ordered gray) fits by a little more snug than the flower patterns. Also seems that the material has a little less stretch than the patterned dresses


To tight on the top and sleeves


Use the size guidelines and order the larger size requirements for the measurements you meet.  It fit perfectly because we followed the recommended size. It is machine washable but hang to dry.  The medium hit below the knee for a height of 5'2".


This dress is really cute. It does fit me a bit too snugly around my chest. But for the price I can't complain.


Color is good didn't like fabric either.


I love this dress. It's so comfortable! I'm 6'2" and it's normally impossible for me to find a dress that is modest, but the length on this one is perfect (hits just above my knee). Highly recommend!!!


I wish there was an XS option because the small is still too big. The length is odd too because it goes about 3-4 inches past my knee and I’m 5’4”. That said, the material itself is really nice. I got it for a costume so I can make it work but I won’t be able to get another to wear normally.
