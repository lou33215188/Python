Very comfortable.


They don't change the waist line to fit the size. So the waist seam is way too close to your boobs and no where near your waist if you have large boobs.


Pretty and the cut is flattering to my fluffy self.


Absolutely love this dress and had many compliments on it. Fit perfect.


tight fit and odd material


Very comfortable and flattering.


Is okay for what i wanted.


loved it so much i had to go order more colors!


Dress is great but fits a little more snug than I expected. It's a great dress and looks exactly like what I expected. Shipping was great-2 days!


It fits great! I’m 5’5 and it hit a little below the knees which is a great length for me. Good material too :)
