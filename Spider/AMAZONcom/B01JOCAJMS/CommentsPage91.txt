This dress is  nightmare. I read the other reviews saying it ran large and to order a size down, which I did. Fits extremely tight and is completely see through. Would not recommend.


Cute dress but I didn't like how it looked on me. Plus it was see thru.


Beautiful dress for the price !! Got lots a compliments I wore it for a day bridal shower brunch , perfect for the occasion


Solid colors are not same fabric or softness as the patrerned


The material was a little thinner than I expected.  I thought it would be a little more structured. But the dress is extremely flattering and comfortable. I love it.


Love this dress! I'm going to buy it in more colors! It's light and comfy and  a good length to wear to work.


I am a size 4/6 and this ran tight in the chest and waist. The fabric is very sheer. The colors are beautiful and the fabric feels soft.


Beautiful dress! It fit just right and isnâ€™t sheer at all. I got the cream color dress with pink flowers. It accentuates my waistline and I love it!!!


Like the style of this dress for casual, ordered a XL and wasn't big enough in the hips... Wish this came in plus sizes


It was cute, but no large available. Refunded promptly. Thanks!
