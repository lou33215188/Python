I thought it would be shorter. Hits below the knee. I was so disappointed. Color as nice. But too long.


Love it! Fits perfectly


need to return for a larger size


The black was a bit see through and the waist was high. I didn't like the fit or fabric and returned it.


It's snugger than I expected.  It's a very casual looking everyday dress.  I wished it was a little longer.


This dress is very comfortable and fits well.  Great for casual wear.


Love the dress....


Received the wrong dress ğŸ˜“ğŸ˜“ğŸ˜“ would have been ok if it had the same sleeve length.


Very flattering, comfortable, wore to work with a cropped blazer and black tights. Felt like a million bucks!


Fits as expected, lightweight material.
