Think the sizing is Asian based, and not American


Received this today and it's very cute!  The material isn't thick, like a stretchy tshirt material, but it's adorable and for the price it's great. Fits true to size also. I'll be getting more.


I'm 5'4 and about 135 lbs (give or take a few).  This dress fits perfectly.  It's light, comfortable, flattering, and requires no ironing, just hang dry.  Score!  I bought two more and am holding myself back from ordering more.


Loved this

Perfect sundress to dress up or keep casual.  Love it!....Wash and wear perfect.
