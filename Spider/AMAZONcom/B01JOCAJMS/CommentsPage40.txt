Love love love this! I was slightly worried about the fabric at first but it is very flattering and fits smoothly. Will be ordering atleast one more in another pattern.


This dress is great! I like the way it flares out and I'm glad I ordered the size I did. This way, it allows for extra room and does not hug my body to tight.


Wife says way to loose in the hips and chest areas makes you look bigger than you are


I absolutely love this dress.  I will be ordering more in other colors.  Super cute!


Expected fit, nice soft material, great for work!


A little bit thin material, had to get full white slip to go under it. Plan on wearing this summer. Slip helps the see through. Light material. Little snug.


Adorable dress. It fits perfectly and is nice a flowy. Already have it in the wash to wear tomorrow!


Very cute, decent fabric, nice color & length.  Does run about a size small, but overall it's a good buy (assuming it washes well)


Love, love this dress!!! The material is so light. Will be ordering more. It is slightly too big but not too much for me to wear anyway. :)


What a wonderful surprise to find a casual comfy dress with sleeves!  Because of the price I took a chance, studied the size chart and read reviews.  I am 5'3", 160 pounds and usually wear a 12-14. Bought the XL and it fits perfectly for me. Loved it so much I ordered another color.
