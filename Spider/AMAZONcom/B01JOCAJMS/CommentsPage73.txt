The print was cute, but the fabric was not as thick as I'd like, also it was cut very small.


Love it ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•ğŸ’•


This dress was not what I expected it to be as it is way too short for my liking & is a little tight.Otherwise it is a pretty dress.


I needed to hem the dress but I expected that since i'm 5'2.


got this as part of a halloween costume, but im going to wear it all the time now. it fits great and ive gotten so many compliments! probably going to order another in a different color.


The waistline hit strangely on me.  It was higher than the natural waist but too low to be an empire waist (on me at least).  It was cute and a light weight material but it did not fit me well. It was rather large as well.  I would advise sizing down.


a little longer than expected


Love the fit! Very cute!


The dress is really cute but the fit is about a size or two smaller than the size chart says.  The fabric is really stretchy though so if you don't mind a skin tight fit you would like it.


The dress is a bit short waisted; I used a wider belt and am able to enjoy the dress.
