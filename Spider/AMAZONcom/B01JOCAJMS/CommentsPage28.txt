I love this dress,  used it today for Easter service and got a lot of compliments.  It is see through but nothing that can be fixed.  I am 5'5 and 135 pounds,  I got a medium and is perfect.  It goes down under me knees I like it.


I bought this dress in 5 different colors because of my hip surgery coming up in 2 weeks.  They are wonderfully soft and are lose enough to be comfortable. I sure I’ll use them long after being healed from surgery as well.


Very nice feeling and draping fabric, but  too clingy, showing


every curve/roll...not attractive on me.


I love this dress! It is not sheer at all and it is very soft.


I ordered a white dress, and it is INCREDIBLY see through. Too see through for nude colored undergarments. I could see every single thing. I will be returning shortly.


I have a longer torso, so the fit wasn't quite what I had hoped. I would still recommend the product. It is a nice cool summer dress.


Pretty color, but fabric too thin and a little undersized.


I’m 5’4” and fairly short waisted. The dress fits great BUT the waist is way too short, even on me. It almost looks like it’s supposed to be an empire waistline! It’s about 3” shorter than where it needs to be. The overall length is fine. Sleeves are fine. The fit around is just right. But the waist line definitely needs adjustment before the fabric was even cut.


It is absolutely different patter on dress than I ordered!!!  The one I wanted could be worn to s viewing  The 1 got no no no would be too embarrassing. Now I’m stuck with nothing to wear


Geez thank for nothing!!! Highly disappointed!


I love this dress! Colors are beautiful! It is slightly see through so you probably need a slip under it. The length was perfect for me. It's a little on the longer side but if you're taller than 5ft it will probably hit your knees.
