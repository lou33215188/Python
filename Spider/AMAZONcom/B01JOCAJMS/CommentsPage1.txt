I bought the floral pink and the royal blue!  They are beautiful, modest and comfortable!  The small has a 29- 30" waist and is 35-36 inches long from shoulder to the bottom of the hemline. These are made of knit fabric so it is easy to move around. These dresses can be worn to work, church or to the store!  Add some jewelry or a belt and jacket and you are ready to go out on the town!  I would definitely recommend these dresses!


I'm 5'9, 190 and the L fits nicely. I'm pear shaped with broad shoulders, and it's flattering. The fabric has decent body, green is mossy not Kelly. Seams aren't perfect. Length to the knee on me which I love. Ordering another color.


IGNORE EVERY NEGATIVE REVIEW ABOUT THIS DRESS!!!


Ok, so I'm guilty...I only read reviews with pictures attached, BUT THIS TIME something told me to read on.  While there were several negative reviews, my gut told me to take a chance on this dress, and I'm so glad I did!!


Sizing:  I am 5"0 about 150 lbs.  My bust is small (34 C), but my hips measure 45 inches AND i have a fluffy, mommy belly, however, I do still have a pear/hour glass shape.  Typically, I float between a Small and Medium depending on whether or not the dress is women's or junior's.  Based on what I read, I ordered the dress down a size in a Small.  I could not ask for any more of this $18 dress.


Fabirc:  It fits up top perfectly.  It hugs my boobs but not in an offensive way.  I tried it on with a dark bra and other than the lines from the bra, I couldn't see it through the YELLOW fabric at all.  I also tried it on with black panties.  Without pulling the dress to lay it against my body, I couldn't see any pantyline/print AT ALL.  Did I say it's YELLOW <--- WHAT MORE DO PEOPLE WANT lol...the fabric is light weight, but not see through.  I held it up to my face when I opened it and I couldn't see ANYTHING but a little light from the sun.  Again, I ask WHAT MORE DO PEOPLE WANT???


Length:  Because I am on the shorter side, it's a teeny bit longer than I would prefer for a party dress, but it's FINE.  The hem it's me not quite at the middle of my knees, but considering the fact that I will have on my trusty body shaper, I need the length anyway so the legs of the shapewear won't show.


Overall:  BUY THIS THANG IN AS MANY COLORS AS YOU WANT!!!  It's under $20 and you CAN'T SEE THROUGH IT!!  If it comes with jacked up stitching, guess what...IT'S AMAZON...THEY ACCEPT PRETTY MUCH ALL RETURNS AND REFUND/EXCHANGE QUICKLY!!!  Based on the yellow, I will certainly order another one in a darker color.


I love this dress. It is cute, comfortable, and knee length. Might not seem like much, but it is rare for tall women like myself to find a dress like this that doesn't show everything. The fabric is thicker than I expected and it had a nice stretch. For reference I ordered my usual size small and I am 5ft7, 140 lbs.


Do you have any idea how difficult it was to find the "right" orange in a skater style dress??


Thank god I found this one - it was PERFECT for my Disneybound.


Anyway - the XL fit really well. I'm 5'11" & 220 lbs


It was comfy and soft, and it hung nicely.


So I looked through the reviews just like everyone else and debated with myself on whether to get this dress or not. STOP debating and get the dress. I can't say much about the solid color choices but the flowered ones are lovely. Fit perfectly. I am 5'10" and 242 pounds. I ordered the XL. And for the price! The quality can't be beat!


I like this dress.


 I got a size Large.


 I read the reviews and the question and answer part, so based on the height and weight of some i was able to make my decision.


 I am 5'5 with the weight of "198-200" around their.


(Sorry i do not know my measurements.)


I ordered a Large and it fit well the material is stretchy and breathable.


It falls right on my knee.


Hope this helped anyone.

Adorable and comfortable. Im 220lbs and ordered the XL, i am 5 ft 4in and it falls right at knee which i love. Will be getting other colors


Dress is well made, the stitching is food and looks secure. The Rose color is true to what you see online. It is a vibrant color and the 'skirt' portion of the dressflares out. It looks nice with or without a crinoline . The fabric is very light weight, stretchy, and is very comfortable. I usually wear a medium an that is what I bought, which fit everywhere but the sleeves were a little tight.


CON: The only concern I found or this dress is that the material is thin enough out will probably need a slip underneathâ€‹.


I ordered the white one for my daughter to tie dye ( which turned out fantastic by the way) and the style was as pictured and great. It hit my 5'4" frame at midknee. I liked it so much , I ordered the green. The fit was again perfect( I wear between a 10 and 12) but the length was 4" longer than the white one(so now I understand the differing reviews about length) . I going to keep it and hem it.
