Pretty dress and great price!


The material is a little thing but fits great! I'm 5'5" medium build, it comes down to my knees and a little loose in the waist.. but the medium size is exactly what I wanted.


Got  this dress for my mom.. she's totally in love with it.. and out looks great too. Nice comfy fabric and great length.


I'm 5'1 225 lbs and a 44DDD and a XXL doesn't fit. It's to snug for my taste.


This is the beautiful dress although a little small.


One size too small.  Material is wonderful and the fit is just right except for sizing.


I love the fit and feel.  I receive compliments everytime I wear it.


Flattering dress, very comfortable.  I am 5 10 and the dress is at my knees.


I love my huhot dresses! They have a wonderful fit and I get compliments everywhere I go! They're also very comfy in the Texas heat!


Precious dress. Love that it falls at the knee so I can wear it to work. Excellent summer dress.
