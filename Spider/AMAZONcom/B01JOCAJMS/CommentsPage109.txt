Very nice material. Wish sizing were a little truer.


So cute on. Very comfy. Great bargain for the price.


Fits true to size.  Color is less vibrant in person, more of a dusty pink.


The material wasn't what I expected, but I like it.


Looks good.  Material is very thin. You would have to wear a slip.  I wear size 16 and ordered an XL.  Fits good.


I love this dress! The color was just like the picture and it fit perfectly!:)


Beautiful...I am ordering more in different colors


very pretty and breathable!


Runs small and the seam cuts way too high above the waist. I'm 5'6. Might look good on a shorter person.


Material is good.  Overall good dress.
