The dress came in just in time for my husband to take me out. I am 5' 9" and this dress reached the tops of my knees, which was exactly the length I desired, and loosely fit my mid section. Great dress for the price and very versatile!


Love love love this dress!! I am 5’ 6” and 155lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. The material is lighter than I expected but I just wore a tank top and slip under and it was fine. Very flattering for those that have a little extra to hide in the mid section!


Fits perfect, Easter dress.


Love it .


love it


Great dress to dress up or down. A style that is timeless!


I liked everything about this dress except for the fit.  After trying it on, I decided the top was just too tight.  I loved the color and the style.


I needed a simple dress that can be worn to work or a night out and this is perfect. I usually wear a 16 and purchased the XL and the fit is perfect. It doesn't hug the bits you want to hide but isn't made in such a way that makes you look pregnant  (which is an issue when trying to find dresses that fit your boobs and body properly. The material is thick and has good stretch, it's not cheaply made at all. I will be buying other colors.


Love it! Fits amazing and I get many compliments


The material isn't the fanciest, but this is a perfect, lightweight black dress.
