Very comfortable for summer. Fits well.very reasonably priced. I am glad I ordered these.


Love the feel, soft and comfy. Arrived on time.


Looks awesome on my wife...but everything does.


This dress was better than I expected it to be! The dress fit perfectly and the material is super soft and stretchy! However, this dress was a tad longer than I wanted it to be, but I am 5'1" so that is to be expected (EVERYTHING is too long on me, lol). The dress sat right at my knees. I am 135 lbs and bought a size large. The yellow is the exact color of the photo!


really long and made of a weird t-shirt material


Fits and flares perfect.  It is just a bit shorter than I expected.


A pretty floral dress that fits well and is comfortable.


Turned out great! Fits nicely and looks great. Very happy with my purchase.


I love this dress.


Very thin material
