Came with a rip in it. I had to return it, but it did fit as expected.


Very flattering on. Beautiful print on this one.


One of my favorite dresses.  Thought it looked a little '90s, but it looks beautiful.  I get more compliments on this dress than any other. Very flowy.  It even looks great as a early maternity dress.


You have to press this dress...ugh.


This dress is so comfortable. The only problem is that it is very see through. Will need to wear something underneath it. Dark color would be better.


Love it.  The product is as expected, 95% cotton and completely wearable.  I will buy another color soon.


Comfortable summer dress.


I bought a S & M, I usually wear M or L, but this time i deffenitly liked the small size better. This dress fits below my knees, which i'm very fine with that. In alI I honestly  loved the modesty of this dress. for reference I am 5'2, 34b, and 130.


Good, thick material (but breathable) with a gorgeous pattern and color. The flare at the bottom is an adorable detail - I feel so pretty in this dress! And the sleeves and length hit exactly where I hoped they would. I want another! (For reference: 5â€™5, 120lbs, S fit great)


It's perfect! It's one of my favorite dresses. I wear it all the time just because it's so comfortable and it fits my body so well. The fabric is something that I also really enjoy as well.
