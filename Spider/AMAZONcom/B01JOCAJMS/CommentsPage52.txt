Very flatterering, super attractive and sooo comfortable


This dress is awesome! Better than expected for the price! Love it and will be buying more!


Beautiful design, fits well! I get compliments on it every time I wear it. I ordered this size because I normally wear a L (US 10-12) I am 5' 5" and 180 lbs. I often make sure to wear nude undergarments as it can be a bit see through. Otherwise, great dress for the price!


I love it..beautiful  shade of green ..I ordered a Medium..I wear a US size 6/8 in womens..fits below the knee I am 5'2..


This dress is beautiful in person. The colors are bright and the fit is true to size. I am 5’9” with broad shoulders and large breasts the XL fits perfect and the length (which dresses are usually short on me because of my long torso) hits an inch above my knee.


Adorable dress that fits perfectly and compliments my wardrobe.  The length is appropriate and the color is vibrant.


The dress is beautiful. It is hard to get sizing exact with online ordering. The sizing on these seems to be inaccurate.


Way too small, ugly color. The yellow looks like a dirty mustard


Love this.  5'5" 170, large fits great and it comes right past my knees.


Received a lot of compliments on the red plaid dress
