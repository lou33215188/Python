It was so cute and it fit so nicely! It was the perfect length I wanted. I order a large and I am 135 pounds and 5 foot 4 inches. It went right below the knee.


Description said midi.  I'm 5 feet and it fit right at the knee.  It was loose so My but wasn't pulling it up to make it short.  Still a nice looking dress.


I have gotten a lot of compliments on it. Perfect for work.


I love it!


Really nice but too small.


Really love this dress! Well made, washes well, no color runs, the stitching does not come out easily. Certainly am A line dress and fits all the right places!


It's nice


The dress fit me perfectly, it's a keeper. I ordered an XL of Orange Peony. I'm 5'7" and 175 pounds, wear a size 12/14 dress -- am 36DD up top and bigger with hips/thighs. The fabric is a light to medium weight knit. The bottom hem came right at my knee and just long enough to cover up the ugly. I have very chunky unattractive knees, but I feel comfortable wearing this dress.  I'll probably wash on gentle cycle, cold water with the rest of the dark delicates, and hang to dry. There's no room for it to shrink upward!  I bought for summer wear, with a denim jacket.  If I wear it during winter, I'll need to wear something underneath, and warm tights.


Used for Halloween dress


It's an okay dress. I didnt like it because it was too light of a pink, and someone said that they could see my beige bra through it.
