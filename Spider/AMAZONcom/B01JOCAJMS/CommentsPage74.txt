I love this dress. I don't leave reviews very often but this is one incredible deal. After the first one arrived, I bought it in three additional colors. Love all of them. Fits as expected, very flattering, lots of compliments.

For a costume


Fits really well and is very comfortable.


Cute as hell, if a little big. Long enough to cover my big booty.


Great basic dress for work.  Can dress it up or down with accessories


Great dress!  Very comfortable, good color, dressed it up with accessories.  I am 5'2"" tall and weigh 195, bought the a xx2 and was very pleased with the fit. Will buy more like this.


Super modest, cute dress. The only issue is that the fabric wrinkles easily. Super cute dress for the money, though.


Super cute but faded really bad in the wash.
