Very light weight and runs small . Would have liked it longer length.


Great material!!!


Love the fabric, fit, and print pattern. Looks much more expensive!


Cute, comfortable and perfect for casual summer wear with sandals.


Very comfortable and cool for hot summer days, and very cute!


Fabric and fit is fine - however there is a sewing flaw in the seam, I fixed but it was very obvious for QC to not notice.


I’m in love with this dress! It fits perfectly and is so flattering! I am typically a M and ordered a M. Do need to wear a slip underneath b/c it’s pretry see-through.


These are the most comfortable dresses. I have struggled to find decent midi dresses, but these are it. I bought three, but I'd love to have one in every color. If you are looking for a soft and just overall darling dress, this is the one for you!


My 10 year old fit in it perfectly for a quick MUSIC MAN costume.


This dress came today and there is a spot right in front , a faded spot in the shape of a circle . Needless to say - I have to return it .
