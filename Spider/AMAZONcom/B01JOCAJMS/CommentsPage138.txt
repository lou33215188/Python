Perfect fit and great quality.  I wore it all day and was so very comfortable in it.  Fabric is the perfect weight and I felt cool enough indoors yet warm enough outdoors in it during the spring.  Will purchase again.


Color not as expected so it was returned.


Love the color and easy wear of this dress. Can wear with tennis shoes or sandals. Nice material that will make this dress comfortable to wear when it's hot outside, but not really see through. Fit is flattering.


Look amazing on me good material and I feel like it's worth the money spent. I am buying more in different colors.


This dress is just perfect. The length was just right, right below my knees. I am 5' 7" and at times find it difficult to to find a dress that's long enough, so I am very happy with this dress. Also, the fabric is soft and feels very comfortable.


I love this dress it is a bit longer than I thought it would be but it fits perfectly and is very comfortable


Questioning if this is an adult size.


I bought this for a costume for Halloween, but was so surprise with its fit and comfort, that I decided to not paint on it (as planned) and keep as a dress to use more. I bought the yellow and was surprised it was not see through at all. Good material, good fit, cute!


Love it


Fit ok for this price, but material this shrink
