Fabrics was a good weight, BR the shape was kind of wonky.  Almost like the darts didn't fit in the right place, empire waist set to high, etc... hope this helps.


Very very thin. Did not hang very flatteringly.


Cute dress that fits well and is figure flattering.  This will be a great vacation dress this Summer.  I also ordered a couple of dresses like this in different colors or patterns.


This dress is darling. A great casual dress for summer.  It's just a teeny bit tight.  I would say the medium fits like a size 6-8, instead of 8-10.  The fabric is nice, a heavy knit, but soft and comfortable.  I plan to order another color.


EMPIRE WAIST!!! Cannot Belt this dress even with a wide belt. VERY misleading photo and VERY disappointing purchase. It seems designers can't find women's waistlines anymore. Either they make"low-waist" (aka HIP HUGGERS), or semi-empire waist. I am short-waisted and even I couldn't make this dress work. RETURNING.


Overall the dress is cute and comfortable, but I think is cuts in sort of high on the waist which I don't love. It would be a perfect dress for someone who is pregnant and needs room for their baby-bump though. I'm 5 ft. 7 in. about 150 lbs and a 32 D. I bought a medium and it fits pretty well, but I probably could have sized down to a small.


super nice quality. sits right at the knee. very comfy.


I purchased this dress for a concert. It wore very well and is very comfortable. It was for the most part flattering, however the waste line was a little high and oddly placed. Other than that, I would say this dress is good quality and I will certainly wear again.


The dress looks great.  I got lots of compliments. I thought it was going to be cotton. I guess only the solid colors are cotton.


This is a really nice dress I typically wear XL but ordered xxl and is a little too tight
