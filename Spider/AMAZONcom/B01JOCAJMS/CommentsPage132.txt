Would buy again.


Purchases for my daughter- fits her perfectly. Nice, soft material.


I bought 2 of these dresses and love the colors, but the fabric is very clingy, and the dress is pretty plain.  I added a belt and a shrug and it looks much better.  I agree with other reviews that the waistline is higher than your natural waistline, but with a wide belt, that can be hidden somewhat.  If you are busty this dress does nothing to hide or minimize and personally I could never wear it without a sweater or shrug to cover that area.  Love the style and colors, but not my favorite or most flattering fit.  Will probably be sending at least one dress back.
