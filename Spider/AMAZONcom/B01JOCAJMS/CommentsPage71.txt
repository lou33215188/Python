This is a GREAT dress, especially for the price. The fabric is nice and I got a bunch of compliments. It's a great length and it fit very nicely. I was hesitant about buying clothes on Amazon but this may be my new thing.


Lovely fit and comfortable.  Can't wait to wear it to School as I am a teacher and I think it will be quite appropriate!


Very nice dress for the price.  I thought it fit as expected, it washes nicely and maintains it size/shape.


Other than a bit small in the bust, this is a great dress.


Decent fabric, not for the large busted


Very comfortable! Fit true to size. I purchase the  floral pattern on dark background. It is a bit thin so Iâ€™m sure the lighter colors would be a bit see through. Will be buy more with different patterns!


What a beautiful dress, I'm very glad I bought it and actually will buy another in white! Highly recommended.


I went by the reviews but I found this fit a little larger. But I got a lot of great compliments on it!


love it, perfect


I cannot even begin to express how much I'm in love with this dress. Great fit! Comfy fabric!  Just perfect!!! I will definitely be ordering more!!!
