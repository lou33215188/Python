I bought it in more than one color because I love it so much!


Very comfy but very very long.


Runs small and cheap material. Disappointed after reading so many good reviews.


I am 5'3" and 135# and purchased a Large.The Navy is a nice shade. It could be a little longer. (The print was longer.) It is flattering and great for shopping or church with a sweater. It is well made with finished seams.


5'4 140 lbs ordered a medium, fits great, good material - I wore a long t-shirt under this, but you don't really need anything under it.


This fit so perfect on my daughter.


The dress would be nice if it wasn't so big around my waist


A little see-through. Definitely need a slip with it. But it fits well and is very cute.


There is no tag that shows material content but it feels like an expensive cotton blend. I am 5'6" 190 and bought XL based on recommendations.  It fits nicely all over except it's really tight on my back. I am ordering more but in XXL so you have extra back fat I recommend going up in Size. Very nice dress.


I got the Green- and the color is VERY DISAPPOINTING ! It's hardly the color in the picture. The dress i received is more like Military dull green... I also got the orange and that was pleasantly a bright , true to the picture dress !


The fit however is great. It is, like many mentioned, a high-waist dress. This style is perfect for those that have an okay upper body but want to hide away the tummy/hips :P


The material is somewhat thin...contours and flab will show.
