nice light material, true olive color. nice fit great for spring summer wear - i'm 5 1 it hits right at the knee.


Product was as labelled and I like it.


Comfy.  Easy to accessorize.  Fun to wear


It is so cute on.  It is very becoming.  The only thing I would change is there is a seam in the back . Looks like they ran out of material and had to piece it.


It fits fine but I didn't find it as flattering on me as it looked on the other reviewers.


This dress with a belt and cardigan is super cute! I want it in every color! I'm 5'4" and 155lbs and the medium fits great. I've received many compliments.


Dress is tshirt material, so it's super comfy. Fit my body type perfect and came down to my knees. When it arrived, my boyfriend asked why I ordered a "Laura Ingalls Wilder dress" but after I put it on he said he likes it on me.


I am so happy with my purchase. It fits just right, feels great, and is well made. I will be ordering more in different colors! Love it!


it was white - not beige like photo


I love this dress! It fits well and is comfortable. Good length and I am excited to dress it up and down for different events. I feel like I am going to end up ordering another color...  :)
