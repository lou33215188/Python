Perfect. Exactly what I needed. Fits well and sits at the knee. I'm 5'2"


Dress fit just as expected.  Size is very accurate.  The dress hangs nicely and is easy to wash/dry.


I am 5'8 and the hemline was great. Fell right to my knees. But the waist line was super high under my bust, not at my natural waist like in the picture. They need to adjust their pattern for taller women.  Beautiful color and the fabric was nice. I returned the product.


Used this for a costume.  It is comfy and light weight.  Got some compliments on it.


Very comfortable.and fit perfect.


Lovely sun dress! Wish it wasn’t so long, but it’s still cute.


I am 5'4", about 155#, and the large fit perfectly. This dress is super comfy and I love it. It falls just below the knee on me, which I like. I will be wearing this a lot this summer and in sure it will get a lot of use in cooler weather with a cardigan. Love love love!


Nice dress. Good price. Color wasn’t exactly what I was expecting but it’s always tricky to pick a specific color online I know this. Was a little tighter than I like. I am 5’11” 163# and bought the large. I will go with an XL next time because the L accentuated my momtummy a little too much for my comfort level.


Fits perfect and LOVE the colors


Well made and fit except in the arms so I returned it.
