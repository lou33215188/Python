I love this dress and the fit. Received a lot of compliments in this dress. Thinking about ordering another one in a different color.


Material looked cheap though clouts were vibrant there was a whitish haze


Super cute dress....a bit thin so a slip is needed


Very convenient and comfortable. I am 4'11 so i had to get it hemmed a few inches. You can easily dress it up or dress it down.


Very pretty dress, but completely see through. Returning it because I can't even comfortably wear it because the fabric is so thin.


A bit see through but super cute


Great fit, the fabric is soft and comfortable,  and very flattering overall. I am 5'9" and the dress falls at knee length on me.


Like the dress s lot!  It fit me s little snug so I gave it to my daughter. It's so cute on her.!


I like it.  I like the way it fits.  I was a little disappointed on how thin the material is.


Got  lots of compliments on this only wish the waist was a little more tapered
