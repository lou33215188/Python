The fit is terrible. It was way too big. This isn't a dress. This is basically a long t-shirt. I returned it.


I bought this dress for Easter 2017, I love it! It fits just like the photos! I will be buying more.


Your scale of measurement is not correct


This dress is comfy yet stylish and also has great length on it. I get asked all the time where I got my dress at.


Soft and comfy for sure.


No problems


It was what but to small & not classy


Fits perfect


The dress is super cute and comfortable, but be forewarned that the material is a little sheer in the lighter colors.


Super soft. Love this dress. Bought more in other colors too!
