The dress has an extremely high waist. I'm 5'4 around 125 lbs and I got the medium (I usually wear a 4-6). .  I have a very long legs 30+ inseam and a very short body yet the waist on this dress was way too high - more of an empire waist. So, the skirt just billowed and the fit was awful. The fabric is also *very* thin - thinner than the average t-shirt.  I had pre-washed as I do with all new clothes, so this will go straight into the donation box.


very cute. fit my 12 year old perfect. it so hard to find dresses that arent too "Mature"  but not to little kid either.  she wears like a a size 12-14 and she is literally in between being a full blown teenager and young woman in terms of her body.  she wants to feel like a girl but not expose her body either.  length and comfort were perfect.

Pretty, thin summer dress. Lighter colors will show dark underwear. My orange dress does. Orange dress looks like orange-red on the screen, but it's  really bright, intense orange for those who wonder.


Love this dress, purchased it in three colors! I'm an apple shaped person, which is the worst, and it's difficult to find flattering and comfy dresses where the sleeves aren't cutting off my circulation or the waistline isn't in my boobs. The material of these is thick and has a smidge of stretch, which is great. Paired with a chunky belt or some leggings it's really cute!
