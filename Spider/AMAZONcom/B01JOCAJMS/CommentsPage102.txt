Lovely Dress . I wear it to work and it fits perfectly.


Thicker material than I expected. Nice enough that it can be dressed up


Really comfortable material. Fits wonderful!!


Super cute. I was expecting to be disappointed. I was not!! It's ADORABLE!! Perfect length.


Not as soft/cottony as I would like, a little stiff even after washing, but nicely made and the fabric does move.


Great dress, especially for the price!


I love this dress! I got a large in black. I'm 5'4, 165lbs, 36DD, and it fits perfectly! :) I may get a few more in different colors.


i love this dress.i will be buying more


Material really soft. Fits as expected.


Doesn't look the same in person. It's a little big and longer than expected. Will have to take it up a little.
