The bust was tight.


Love it! Perfect for summer. Doesn't wrinkle - I can roll it in my luggage and it still looks good.


somewhat large and unflattering fit.


Cute dress fits well. A bit longer on me than I thought.


I haven't washed this dress or worn it out yet, but I just tried it on and it fits beautifully! It's a lovely thin fabric that's perfect for summer, and the skirt is a gorgeous cut that flares out nicely. I'm about to go look at the other prints because I want another one just like this!


It isn't too tight, and it's great to wear everyday. It is the right combination of modest and modern!


I have purchased many many Lularoe dresses, spending hundreds of dollars! This dress, for no more that 20 dollars, is even more amazing than any Lularoe! Love it!!!!


I love this dress it fits perfectly. It run true to its size


So cute, perfect weight, would buy again!


Love this dress! The length and the cut, it fits me perfectly
