Love this dress!!


I have yet to try the dress on my daughter but I'm already not that happy. First of all, I had to send the first dress back because it wasn't as described. It doesn't fit small and it's not short. My daughter is 5'7 and 120 lbs. the medium was down to her knees and too big. I sent it back and just received the small. Pulled it out of the bag and it's coming apart at the seam. She needs it for a function so it's too late to send back. :(


great fit and really cute


Loved it! Fit great & like it said it would! Definitely recommend for a light spring dress!


Super cute fit but very thin fabric. I ordered the white and it's a bit see through.


It was very cute on my granddaughter. And the material was very soft and fit very well


Good value for the price. Comfortable fit and after wearing it I ordered 2 more.


great color and fabric.  Fits a bit small. Waistline feels strange: too high for waist, too low for empire.  length at bottom of knee ( I'm 5'3')


This is a fantastic summer dress. I was looking for a dress that I could wear for summer with short sleeves.  Almost impossible to find here in FL.  Most summer dresses are sleeveless. I read the reviews, looked at the photos of the dress other buyers posted and I took a chance.  I am 5'3" and 137.  The medium was too tight in the bust area so I returned it for a large. It fits well.  It is a little bit long for me but I can wear it as it is.  My husband liked the price and look so much that he wanted me to buy several, which I did.  I love the flowers.  I got several flowers and one solid.  The tan/flowers was to see through for me and I didn't want to wear a slip in our FL humidity and heat so I am returning it.  It is a light weight material so I stuck with the darker colors and the flower patterns.
