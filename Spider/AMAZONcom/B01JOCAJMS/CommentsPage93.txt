Beautiful dress but was pilling by the first use! Very disappointed.  It is a little thin as well.  However, it's soft and the fit is very flattering.  Just wish it wasn't already pillingl


Super cute and simple black dress!


perfect fit looks and feels great


Gorgeous casual dress!!


This might be my new favorite dress. It's so soft, and comfortable!


The material quality is the same as the price - cheap. I won't buy another one


Great dress - great purchase !


I'm going to buy in other colors and someone asked for the info to purchase as well


This was way too small and had to be returned.


Very soft, comfortable and feminine feeling. Will probably purchase more in different colors. Can be dressed up or down.


The dress is nice. The quality is good, but I don't like as it fit me, usually I have a small but this dress is too large on the waist.
