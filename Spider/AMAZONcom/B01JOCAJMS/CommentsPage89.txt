Very comfortable! Great fit!


soft fabric


This dress is so flattering. Hits just at my knee (I'm 5'7")  I wear it paired with a navy duster type cotton cardigan on cooler days. Its comfortable and light weight.


I love the styling, fabric and flow of the dress. The only negative comment is that it fits a bit snug at the top. i norma;;y wear medium but i should have oedered a large.


Good


This dress is perfect! I bought a size bigger than usual and it fits well.  I received several compliments through out the day.


This dress is wayyyyy to long and very disproportionate.


Great quality! Super cute


I like the overall fit and style of the dress, but the color was not as anticipated.  I bought the green thinking it was a brighter green, but the dress was definitely a dull green - like a camo green.


Very cute. Will probably get another one shortly. Comfortable
