Not quite the Everest green that the picture shows but still a very pretty green. Nice length, I am 5'6" and it goes to my knees. Heavy, quality material, however it does wrinkle easily. Overall would buy some other colors to add to my closet.


fits just right!  fabric is thick somewhat heavy but fine quality.  May be a little warm in summer but a really nice work dress for me!


I'm 6'4... Fits well and looks fantastic!  Perfect casual dress for spring and summer!  Definitely going to buy more.


Nice dress.. I mean, nice for the price.


I love it.


I bought this so I would have a plain black dress for warmer weather.  It says "Hand Wash Only" but I threw it in with my cold water delicates/darks, hung it to dry and it lost the inch or so it was too long to begin with.  The sleeves are a little snug, but I'm a fairly muscular overweight person and they do stretch nicely without ripping the thread.  I'm 5'4" and the XL comes to just below my kneecaps (making it the PERFECT length).  Wouldn't dream of trying to wear anything this fitted without a cami underneath (just feel more dressed that way), but the fabric in the black at least is probably thick enough it shouldn't be absolutely necessary if you're comfy wearing something this unstructured without it.  I will probably buy it again in another color.  It does have a seam at the waist (not ideal) but is high-waisted enough it is almost an empire waist so I can deal with it.  I ordered the Orange Peony after the black fit so well, but it fits a little smaller, the fabric is thinner (and more prone to static), and the dress is generally shorter.  Still good, but keep in mind sizing is NOT consistent.  Neither dress shrunk any more after the second wash.


This dress is super comfy and easy to throw on.


Love it!!


Exceeded my expectations!!


A little see through but if you have the right color bra you will barely notice it.
