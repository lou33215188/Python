I got the large. It was a little tight in the bust. I expected it to be shorter but it is quite long on me and since I’m 4’10” I’m sending it back to get another that is more the right length.


Love this dress! I purchased one in black, and once I tried it on, I promptly ordered 3 more dresses in varying colors and patterns. This is super comfy and flattering. If you have a large chest, I recommend going up one size.


I like this casual tee drrss because its comfortable and fits perfectly.  I'm thinking of buying another one.  The dress is true to size I usually wear a small to medium.  I'm. short so the hits just below my knees.  Thank You.


The fabric is great!! The dress is to small!! Creeps up around the arms


This dress is really cute on! Its not cotton more like a lycra/spandex material. I'm very busty and bought a large and it fit perfect. It flares at the bottom and i feel really girly. For the price you cant beat it!


It fits perfectly! I’m 6’2” and it hits just above my knee which is perfect!! I love the wine color too.


I couldn't even wear it to see if it fits. The dress was already used by somebody. I got a used dress instead of a new one. I am returning it today.


Love, love, love these dresses! Easy to put on and look great! I keep coming back and ordering more!!


Great dress and fits well. I like wearing it with leggings.


This dress is so flattering on me. The fabric isn't the best quality, but I think it is well worth the price.
