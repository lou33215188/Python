Love the color... I wish the length was a little short.


I bought a large and I love it! Lol I can't for the weather warms up.


I wore this dress to church yesterday. Very comfortable. I am getting another one!!


Good dress. I like the length, it was right above the knee. Comfortable fabric.


it's very comfortable.  It fits a little big, but that's better than too small.


Daughter had me decorate this for Halloween and liked it a lot.


Absolutely love thus dress! Super comfortable. absolutely gorgeous!


just as expected, very good for the price


Simple and cute. Material is good.


Bought this for part of a Halloween costume.  Adequate price for purpose.
