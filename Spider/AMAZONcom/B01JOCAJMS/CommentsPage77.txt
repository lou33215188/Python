I’m 5’5”, 135 pounds, and a 34B. The small fit perfectly although if you are looking for something short this is not the dress for you. The dress came right to about my knee; maybe even an inch below my knee. It paired well with a thin,braided leather belt.


Beautiful dress, long enough for work


Love it


Could have gone a size smaller. I love the length of the sleeves though, they are not too short like most t-shirts/dress sleeves.


I sent the two dresses back I did not know I could print a return label till I have already sent them. I wrote on the package return to sender. And put all my information written on paper and placed inside package.


Looks as great as it wears!


Received & it was a bit bigger than anticipated.  Shrank when washed and fits very comfortably.  Size small will probably the perfect fit because i like things a bit more on the snug but still comfortable side. Still super happy and Will order again in multiple colors.


Loved this summer dress! Fit as expected and drops just above knee so not too short. I wash AND dry this dress with almost no shrinkage. Throw it on and add jewelry...done!


My daughter was very happy with her dress. It fit perfectly, and was a bit longer than her knees. She wants to wear skirts that are modest and cute. This dress fit both!


Fits well, looks nice
