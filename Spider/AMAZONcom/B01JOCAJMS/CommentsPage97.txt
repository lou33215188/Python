Very comfortable! Great quality fabric. A little roomie in the waist but that’s okay. I’m 5’8” and an XL comes right to my knee.


Very cute dress! Worked perfect for my Animal Crossing costume


Nice dress, I wear it to work, it works fine for business casual.


Pretty but not my style


It would have been perfect if it came in a petite size. The fit and style is fine but it's a bit too long for my heighth so I'll need to have it altered.


Really like this dress. Fits well and is a perfect length. Definitely recommend if you have a little extra on the backside, ample material and loose fit on the bottom.


A little tight in the top and the waist fits at an unflattering place on me.  I will keep it for casual wear around the house.


It's a nice dress. Comfortable and pretty bright color. Easy to dress up or wear casually.


The fabric is very thin. I don't think I'll be able to wear it without a slip. I like the color and the pattern.


I love this dress. The fit was perfect and it goes right to my knees. The fabric is soft and stretchy. It's a great dress and a great price.
