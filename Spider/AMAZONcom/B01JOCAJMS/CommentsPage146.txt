Very cute one but very see through!! My daughter has to wear a tank top & leggings under it, very discouraging!


The dress fits great and is super comfortable! I wear it with a belt, because it is a little loose around the midsection. I ordered green, the photos appear to he Kelly green, but it's actually more of an olive/Forest green. Next time I'll try the blue one!


The bodice was a bit tight but from the waist down it was perfect. It flows nicely, flares attractively, and the length was just right hitting right below the knees.


It's a great dress. It's comfortable and is great for summer. It does show things on it (like water) easily, and it seems to wrinkle easily, but the wrinkles just come out.


This is a nice cotton dress. It fits true to size and I bought it to wear in Florida.


I bought this dress in pink and in black, and I was so excited when they arrived early. However, I'm 5'2" and the dress length went all the way to about my mid-calf and the dress did not flare out. It looks much better online than in person, and upon closer inspection I realized the pink one had a small stain. At least I get to return the dresses for free.


This dress is really nice. I am 5'9",so it is above my knees. I was hoping it would go below, but I  have that problem being taller. Otherwise it is just perfect.


I love this dress. It was a very flattering fit. I have a hard time finding dresses with both sleeves and a decent neckline, since I'm uncomfortable wearing low cut or sleeveless tops. Paired with a cute belt this worked perfectly to wear to church and I got lots of compliments.


Too small and too short. Fabric was much thinner than I expected. You get what you pay for!


Comfortable, good amount of stretch, and very flattering. A little thin, but will make a nice summer dress. Came back to order more colors, as this is a perfect dress to dress up or dress down for any occasion.
