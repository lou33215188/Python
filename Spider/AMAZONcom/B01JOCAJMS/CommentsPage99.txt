It's easy simple and comfy and yet I get compliments everyday I wear it. Winner!


it was too big, very long.(im 5"2 and 140 LB i got a med.  i'm not fan.. but friend loved it so i gave it to her.


Cute  and I liked the flare of the skirt.  The waist of the dress fit a little above my natural waistline.


The skirt in the picture looks with more flare and volume than it really has. I wanted it to go to work with a pearl neacklace but is more casual than work attire.


Not the material I expected.


Not impressed with the fabric.


I really didn't like how it fitted and it was long. I thought it was a little shorter but it's okay. I do love the color.


Very comfortable and flattering!


Very comfy to wear


Great dress and it fit perfectly but some of the sewing was not correctly done and was on the waistline
