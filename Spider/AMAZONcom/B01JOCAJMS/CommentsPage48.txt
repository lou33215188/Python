This dress is so cute! Love the sleeves and the colors. It is a little bit big though-I weigh 125 and am 5â€™7 and I got a small. Iâ€™ll still wear it and it will still look super cute though! Great spring dress


Great fit (as expected) and hits a bit below the knee which is cute (Iâ€™m 5â€™3â€�). I definitely needed a half slip because itâ€™s somewhat thin. Sleeves are a comfortable flattering length and fit. I just bought two more! Also the brand â€œHUHOTâ€� (â€œwho hotâ€�) cracks me up.


Itâ€™s okay. Not thrilled with the color after washing it looks old! Good fit though and fits well.


It's a little small. However, I find myself wearing this all the time. In fact, I'm ordering 2 more!


I absolutely love this dress! I get compliments all the time wearing it. I am 5'2" and weigh 150. I got a size large like I would in any other brand and it fits great! I comes right past my knee, almost like a tea length dress since I am short. It's beautiful and I plan on buying more dresses in this brand and style!!


Get casual/work dress fit a little bigger than I would have liked, if you are like me and order a size up on amazon, don't with this one.


This dress didn't look anything like the picture. Clothes from China tends to do that. The picture always looks nice, but the clothes are poorly made and do not look like the pic.


Nice quality. Smelled a little like vinegar when I got it but it came out when I washed it. I'm short (5'2") so it hit way lower on my than I thought, about mid calf when I figured it hit about the knee.


Lovely quality, fits as expected. I wish the dress came in an XS size. I've taken it in a little and now it fits perfectly, given that it's a small and I love it.


Very cute-nice simple dress that can be dressed up with sweaters, tights, jewelry, etc. Will definitely order more colors in the future.
