Beautiful dress just dislike the thin see through material flower pattern nice but dress is a waste


I really like this dress, the only (very minor) complaint is that it fits a bit more snugly through the torso than I would have liked.  But other than that, it's nice-looking, worked fine for the event I bought it for, and I did get a lot of compliments on it!


So cute, but got pills on the fabric from sitting, arms moving, any touched surfaces.


Super cute dress for a summer wedding- really comfortable. I did wear a light colored cami slip underneath because the fabric is a bit sheer.


Beautiful fabric and cut but the 3x fit a family member who wears a large, not the one who usually wears a 2x.


LOVE these dresses! I've bought 3 so far in different colors / patterns. They wash up great. They ft perfectly and look adorable. We have been needing some cute church dresses that are both flattering and modest for our adolescent girls and these fit the bill. You really can't beat that price too!


Fabric is lightweight and does not hang well from the body.


Nice dress but too small


Comfortable! I ordered a small, I’m petite weighing 110 lbs at 5’3. Great fit with a pair of sandals!


Perfect for upskirts at work. I can give a sneak peek to any perspective lay. Upped my game 100%
