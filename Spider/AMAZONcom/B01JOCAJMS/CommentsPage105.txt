used it for a Joy costume. worked perfectly and fit perfectly.


The fit is just as expected.  This particular print is extremely see through.  I will be returning this dress.


Finally, a cute dress that is long enough on me! I'm 5'10 and super leggy so I always have a hard time finding dresses that cover everything. This hits right above my knee and is great for work or for casual wear. I am about 130 lbs 32B and got a medium, but it's a little loose on my up top, so I could have gone with a small. It looks fine though, it's just on the looser side. Overall, it's a great dress and I will definitely be buying more!


Ugly in person


I love the  material it feels like a t shirt. Size is expected I wear size 10 and ordered a large.


you can dress it up or dress it down, beautiful fit, love the color, doesn't fade in the wash


I'm a 14/16 and ordered an XL.  It's a little tight so I'm wearing it with a vest.


Order one size up.


The dress fit perfect  I love it I'll be ordering another one soon thanks amazon.


Comfortable.  Easy care.  Wish I liked more of the patterns and colors.
