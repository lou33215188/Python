i clicked "repeat order" from a version of this dress i previously purchased and LOVED (by HUHOT) and instead received this one (by Binroyal). amazon helped sort that issue out but the material is sub-par. Scratchy, thinner, not as quality. if you're looking at this dress seek the "comparable" one by HUHOT instead.


I LOVE this dress! It feels WONDERFUL on! I had purchased the black one, and it is a tad shorter than the floral, but overall I'm very pleased with both.


very comfy, great for travel- covers enough but not bulky, can layer with sweater or jacket, light weight, pavks well


Made well but not crazy about the material & the waist is at a strange place & is not flattering.  It should be higher or lower. Love the pockets but they fall right at the hips adding bulk where most of us donâ€™t need it.


It is very small ... I wear a L and I order a XXL because I wanted it to be loose.....it's very snug but I can wear it


I love this dress. It's a perfect fabric. Maybe a light slip but for Florida weather it's perfect. Fits as expected.


Dress is very simple and comfortable. Can dress it up or down.


So cute and classy! I cannot wait to wear this dress to work.


I ordered the navy peony in small and it's adorable. I'm 5' 6", 127 lbs and a 36D. It is a little snug through the bust, and a medium probably would've worked a little better up top, but the small is okay. It's super comfortable and cute!


I love the way it fits. True to size. The flowy bottom helps hide my love handles. Its not too long or too short. Length is perfect. Colors are gorgeous. I've already washed it a few times and the colors stay bright.
