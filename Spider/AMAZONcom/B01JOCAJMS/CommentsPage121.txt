Fits perfect but the quality of cloth is not rich


cinch is a little high so it doesn't hug your waist where desired but still cute and super comfy!


I LOVE THIS DRESS. I got it to alter into a Wednesday Addams dress for work because it actually goes to my knees, BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH. Its a nice t shirt feeling cotton, its got a bit of a stretch to it, the arms aren't tight at all. I just really love this dress.


Fit perfect! Paired with a jean jacket for a modern look.


Fit as expected. Nice dress for daughterâ€™s band concert.


perfect fit.


I ordered the short sleeve round neck dress, and received a tank dress. Not impressed.


Color no where near green shown


So gorgeous! Wearing this for family pictures and it couldn't be any prettier! Buying an all black one too.


Very pleased with sizing.  This can be dressed up or down!
