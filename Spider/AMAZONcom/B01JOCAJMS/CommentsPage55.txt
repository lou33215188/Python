This dress fits perfectly!  I got a small and I'm 5'9" and 125 lbs.  The pattern is a little bit different than what is online.  The flowers have a little bit of pink in them and they are white in the picture.  I love the dress though!


very cute and slimming but drying it a few times has ruined the material


I love this dress! It's perfect for work or a casual outing. I live in south Florida and find it light and breathable.


comfortable and soft material for the warmer months.


super cute, fades a bit after washing, but very good quality, I tie it up on the inside for a flattering fit.


Love this dress, so comfy and cute.


Great dress for me! This dress is extremely comfortable and easy to care for. I only wish there were my patterns available!


Dress fits perfectly. Nice and flowy. Great for the summer. Knee length but also looks cute with leggings.


Nice stretchy material. Flattering empire waist. I'm 5'7" 195# ordered L. Perfect:) hits right below the knee on me.


Beautiful color!  Pair it with a summer scarf or some cool jewelry and you're ready to go!
