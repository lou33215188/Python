Really cute dress. Fits as expected and is a perfect length.


Terrible dress! I purchased this dress style from another Amazon seller, and absolutely loved those dresses (I purchased a total of 5 from another seller). This dress has a very strange shape to it, it's wide and short, too large in some areas, the waist isn't even in the correct place. I would STRONGLY recommend AGAINST buying any dress from this seller. It's no bargain if its just trash.

Love the cut and look of dress


Love this dress! The fabric is great for the summer. The color is vibrant and the fit is great as well. It's pretty try to size. I'm 5'2" and 155 lbs. I ordered the large and it's perfect!


Runs way small


The material is very thin.


Will be perfect for costume for a play.

Live the dress and is very comfortable
