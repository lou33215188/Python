This will be my go to dress when I need to grab something on a Monday or a day when time has escaped me. It is soft and the flare is really cute


This is a nice casual dress. fits as expected the material is a little thin though. Almost needs a slip which I refuse to wear!!!


Love the pattern and fit butthe fabric fades FAST!


Comfortable material, fit as expected,  skirt fell right above my knee (5'7). The bodice was a little tight so size up if needed.


I Love this dress, I bought a size small Fits just right I am 5'4 at 115lbs, I wish I would of gotten a Med. Just because I like my dresses louse for the hot days in Hawaii, It fits just right but I like my dress a little big but that me, now that I'm almost 60 lol


For the price this is great. Just a cute simple dress. Perfect for summer. Could easily be dressed up or kept casual. I need to order a few more.


I SUPER love this dress. It's not see through-I was worried it would lighten over the areas that are stretched (specifically my bust) IT DOESNT!


I am 5'5 1/2 and it hits just below my knees. I ordered the lemon print. It's a super soft fabric and light enough for summer but also easy to add tights under for fall.


This is comfortable and well fitting dress.  The stretch fabric is very easy care and I am thrilled this dress  fits so well.  The dress arrived in great condition, was well packaged and arrived earlier than I had expected.


Fits great, ordered my normal size SM (5'5, 116lbs, small chest). This dress hits about an inch below my know which is perfect for work. The material is thin and if held up to the light you can see through it. But in black, no one will ever notice. I think it's a great value for the price.


I can't tell you how many compliments I get on this stress. But fits great over my 38G girls. And for $20, you can't beat that! Please release more prints.
