On time and as described.


Very cute. The dress hits the knees which is nice. I'm 5'4, 125lbs and the medium is perfect for me


Perfect shade of green.


Really like this dress! I was between a medium and large, and the large fit great. I even got a compliment from a stranger when I wore it to a farmer's market. Might need to get another!


Beautiful size down though


Cute but daughter couldn't fit it


Fits perfectly and looks great!


Fabric quality is really nice. I'm 5'2, 140lbs and ordered a medium in the royal blueb It fits perfectly but runs a bit longer than I would like. It hits just below my knees. But I liked it so much and thought it was a great deal, so I ordered a blck one too! I will probably hem both of them to the length I like.


Fits great. Very confortable.


Color was a little darker than the picture for the type of yellow I had thought it was, but that is okay by me.  Fits me great, just need to take make sure about wearing nude underneath.
