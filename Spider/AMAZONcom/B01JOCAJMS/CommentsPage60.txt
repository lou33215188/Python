I love these dresses, layer up or down they are amazing.


I love this dress. Perfect fit. Very flattering.


I like it.  I am happy with my purchase.


Beautiful! Soft, lightweight fabric without being too thin, and super comfortable. I'm 5'9", 150 lbs and large busted, and a large fits very well. I could've fit a medium, but I prefer the large (I don't like tight sleeves). Absolutely beautiful, and I want to buy more colors!


I really like this dress it's just a little bit longer than I was expecting, I'm 5'9 so I wasn't expecting something that came past my knees. While it is really comfortable and flows as I was hoping, it is a little bit big around my waist which is about 38 inches. I definitely be buying more colors just maybe a size smaller.


The dress came packaged well and it fit perfectly.  The color was exactly what I wanted and the quality of the dress was amazing.  I will definitely be ordering some more colors if possible.


My wife loves these dresses. Looks great on her! She has a collection going now!


I absolutely love this dress. It fits perfectly and is so soft. It fits well in the waist and flows out in a perfect A-line. Will definitely be buying more colors.


Color is slightly lighter and more olive-toned than the picture (which makes it look like a dark emerald green), but still beautiful. The simple classic style is easy to accessorize for all kinds of different looks.


Comfy and nice shape. Wanted it loose, not snug, so ordered a size up - and it's perfect. Color is great. Will probably by more colors! Great work/casual summer dress - neck line is comfy and conservative.
