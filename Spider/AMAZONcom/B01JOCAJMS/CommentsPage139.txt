Loved the dress and the fit. I am pear shaped, 36B, usually wear size 8 or 10 dresses, so opted for a large based on reviews. Although my arms are somewhat heavy, the fit was great. I am about 5'5" and the dress came down to just above my knees. I would have preferred it to be a little shorter but it was fine. Overall good price and great fit, my only complaint is that the material was significantly damaged after ONE WASH. I placed the dress in a delicates bag and washed it in cold water and hung it to dry, and it still had some scuffed areas on the material. I am severely disappointed by that. I wish I knew it'd be like this so I could have just hand wash it instead.


Comfortable, I got a lot of compliments.  Basic lbd.


Large
