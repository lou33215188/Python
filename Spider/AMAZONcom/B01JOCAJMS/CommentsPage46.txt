Fabric weight is very nice.  Will be a nice dress to put on to go to the store.. Very pleased with the fit also, and length since I'm petite at 5" it hit me at mid knee.


Very cute! It looks a bit more casual in person than in photo. It is really a t-shirt dress, matte not shiny. The red is also slightly less vivid than in photo. So, it could  be dressed up with jewelry but the fabric is not 'fancy.' True to size -- I'm 5'6"/118 and S fits perfectly.


Love this dress.  The style is perfect on any figure and can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion.  Love it.


kinda thin fabric, you might have to use leggings or a slip.


fits perfect right size and everything thank you Louisa Might order more dresses from in the future thank you right now.


This dress is so comfortable and easy to wear. Definitely a great buy. Donâ€™t think about. Just purchase it. You will be glad you did


I love this dress, however, I can tell after wearing it three times and washing it a couple of times, it is not going to hold up very well. The print is so fun and beautiful.


I would suggest ordering up a size. I usually wear a large with plenty of room but the large is snug. I will definitely having to wear something slimming underneath it.


Seaming is oddly placed, it should be higher (empire waist) or lower so you can wear it with a belt. Too bad I missed the return window...


Wife loves it.  Glad I ordered a Large, she is normally a Medium top/Small bottom, but like many things coming from overseas, was good to order 1 size up.
