Beautiful dress


I ordered this dress for my Fran Bow Halloween costume. It fit perfectly, the fabric was soft and bendable, and the length was perfect. Loved it, would definitely order again!


This dress is great for work and other occasions where you want something casual but more modest. For reference, I'm 5'4" and ordered a small, and it hits me just above the knee. It's soft and comfortable and fits fairly well! It's a bit loose around the midsection but can be fixed with a belt.


Just what I was looking for. Great for travel. Good length and I liked three cap sleeves.


Love this lightweight modest dress!


I'm 5'7"and 138lbs. I ordered a large because i like looser fitting cloths. Its perfect and comes just below my knees.


Dress fits great! For reference, I’m 5’1 and 104lbs and I bought the XS. Please please make some more color options in XS, it’s a perfect everyday work dress not to mention the price is right!


Really cute dress. Fits true to size, has a bit of stretch to it. Got the beige/peony and it was see through so you will need to wear a slip and nude colored underwear. Was very comfortable, perfect for summer when you don't want to wear anything too heavy.


It fit, but it wasn't flattering on me


Had to reorder the medium fits much better, very happy.


Good as expected and looks nice. Stretchy soft material as expected. However this is not office wear.
