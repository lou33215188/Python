Great material and fit - will definitely purchase in other colors / prints!


I love the length and fit of this dress! It's so cute and it can go with any accessory or shoe you can imagine! I love it!!


I ordered an xl. Use size chart.


A bit long but I am very petite. Cute dress.


Comfortable but a little to long


Got a lot of compliments fit nicely very comfortable


Too long


Not the best quality but just needed it for a costume so it worked. It was a little long


Nice way to get dressed quickly,good fabric.
