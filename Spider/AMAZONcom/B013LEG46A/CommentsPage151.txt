It got here fast, the size was perfect, the fabric is of nice quality and for the price it was definitely worth it.


I love flared dresses because I have no figure. I don't need to hide stuff, since there's nothing to hide, lol. The length was perfect. I'm 5'5"-5'6" and the hem came about 1-2 from my knees. I can bend over without giving a show. I thought I might be too old wear a dress like this, but it's super cute! If there is anything I would change, it would be where the band is for the "waist" area. For those with a very short torso, no worries. But for people like me with a longer torso, the band is only an inch or so below my breasts. Sort of an awkward place. But this dress is so simple, it's perfect. I can dress it so many different ways, I can wear it 3 times and no one would ever know! It's like the staple "little black dress" that every woman needs, it's just purple! Love the material too! Comfy, so much so, I think I could sleep in it!
