It was a little large on me, but I got it for a dance costume last minute so I can't really complain too much.


Probably wouldn't wear it as a dress out and about because it hits me at a weird length, its past my mid thigh area, but not to my knees. Really weird length (I'm 5'7)


It is a pretty decent dress. It was a little loose on the top but my daughter is very thin. It looks really nice on her and she is happy with it.


I'll be returning this because the skirt was absolutely massive on my frame. The way it's made I had hoped it would be flattering on my somewhat more straight figure but I think this dress would suit those with specific proportions best.


This looks adorable on my daughter. Shes somewhat petite. 5'5 and a half and weighs about 125


This dress is very classy. I bought it for a casual wedding however it's a little too dressy. If you are looking for something elegant this is it! Fits well, true to size (5'5" 130lbs small is perfect)


Dress is cute a little long I’m 5’3 and 125 lbs usually wear size medium. Dress fits great everywhere but was a little longer than I wanted..... but I am on the short side


The reviews were right. This dress fit wonderfully. I'm about 5'6" 170 (36D), and the medium fit great. I was afraid it might be a little short, but it wasn't too bad. The fabric is of good quality, and the color (salmon) was as expected. I really love the way I feel in this dress. Buy it! Money well spent.


So beautiful! My daughter is a size seven and the small worked for her!!


This dress is really pretty. I'm usually a 14 in dresses so I ordered a XL. It fits fine. The material is really stretchy and comfortable.


Great little black dress! Fits perfectly and not tight around the waist which is a plus! Perfect for a wedding or party.
