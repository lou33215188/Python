I really like this dress. Comfortable but durable material. I originally ordered a med but with the stretchy material that was a no. Went with a large and I'm much happier! I'm about 5'5" and 155, I carry my weight in my middle. The large didn't make me feel self conscience even with the shape of the dress so that made me happy.


The dress is really beautiful, and very well made.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the sizing.  I normally fit into a small or x-small in dresses.  I am 5 ft/108 lbs and the extra small was huge on me.


The dress fits just right. It is beautiful and well made. My daughter likes it a lot.


I was skeptical about purchasing clothing online because i can't try it on but as long as you know what size you wear then it should fit! I hate that it came folded in a box because now I have to take it to the cleaners for a steam press, other than that, I'm satisfied with my purchase!


Love this dress! I feel confident in this dress and I knew it would be my go to dress as soon as I tried it on. Came ready to wear with no wrinkles whatsoever. Out of all my purchases on Amazon, this is my best so far.


This dress is cute, but it is larger them I expected. I think I would looked it better out it for properly.


Fit was perfect and looked so nice on my daughter.


Hugs your body like a glove. Love it. Very classy looking. Well made. Sooo happy with it. : )


Very nice dress!  My daughter absolutely loves the look, the feel and how it fits.  The color is true to what you see and the size is accurate.


Has a very thick material and is very well made. Order off bust size. I am not comfortable with my belly area and this dress has no problem hiding it and I feel good about myself in it and I enjoy wearing it out!
