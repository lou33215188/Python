Fits great! I was worried about the size(bought an XL). Fits great.


Itâ€™s cute. Just not what I had hoped for.  The lace is super shiny, which I guess for the price is to be expected.


Love my dress!!! Just tried it on, haven't had a chance to wear it yet.


Better that what i was thinking it is


I'm not opposed to short dresses but this one looked ridiculously short on my 5'10" body!


I am 5'1 and 170 with curves and the medium is a perfect fit! The fabric is high quality and very forgiving! This is a beautiful dress and very flattering.. I love it!


If you're above 5'6", don't even bother.


The dress itself is beautiful. But when it came it had a burnt smell. Would have given 5 stars for the fit and color, but it smells horrible.


Very disappointed.  The style of the dress and especially the neckline are totally different than the pictures


It was small and short
