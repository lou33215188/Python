Perfect fit


The dress looks really good on; however the zipper is problematic. Hard to get up and down.


Love it


Love this dress! It is super cute and it fits perfectly!! :)


It's so cute I love it!! I Was nervous at first since I am a little bigger but now I don't want to take it off!


Absolutely Love!!! Very Flattering! Usually wear a 16/18 and ordered a XL. The dress fits very nicely!


I love the shape of this dress, but wish the lace was a little higher quality. The minty colour I purchased is. Beautiful but could use a liner.


Absolutely love this dress!! Fit perfect and was amazing for my office Christmas party!!
