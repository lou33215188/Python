not bag, the material is very stretchy but not super flattering. kind of had to make sure i had some spanx on or something to kind of keep myself smooth under the dress. overall tho, from afar, the dress looked nice ^_^ color was nice too!


There are not enough positive things to say about this dress that will accurately express how happy we were with this purchase.


Dont get me wrong I love this dress but its a bit large it the waist area and stomach area. The dress is also longer than the picture depicts the dress to be. But overall great material and very comfortable I would love this dress more if it was just a tad shorter


loved it very  pleased with both dresses.


Great dress! Good quality! Fits as expected


Everything about this dress is amazing! It loold just like the picture, the quality is great and the cut and fit couldn't be better. It arrived a day earlier than expected and was a completely positive and hassle-free experience.


Super comfy and quality material! It's about a half size big for me 5'7 127lb I love this dress though, very flattering!


I love the material, the fit, and the length. I usually wear about a size 8 and I am 5'8 148lbs. I ordered a medium and it was spot on! If you're around my size and don't want it to be super form fitting I'd order up one size.


I got an XL, just to be safe, however, I think a large would have been fine. There is lots of room, the material is nice and I love the colors! Just like the picture.


Very comfortable and flattering. For as expected.
