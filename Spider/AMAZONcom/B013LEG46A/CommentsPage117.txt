The small fit more like a women's medium (8 - 10) although it's a very cute and well-made dress.


This dress was perfect for the occasion, nice quality, I loved the vibrant blue. I ordered a small I'm (140lbs) and it fit great.


I ordered this dress for my daughter's 8th grade graduation. I ordered the xs hoping it would fit her as her measurements were well under the sizing chart. It fits her perfectly.


I purchased this for a wedding and it’s even cuter in person! Totally fits true to your normal size and the fabric isn’t cheap and thin at all. GREAT BUY.


This is my favorite little black dress!! Fits nice, very complementing. Got tons of compliments!


Gorgeous! So elegant!


I loved it! I didn't think it was going to fit when I first saw it. I tried it on it was perfect! I don't normally buy clothes online.


Very very good quality
