Love this dress! I wore it to a wedding and received many compliments.


Pretty dress, but not the one intended. We wanted the one with lace, somehow we got the one with sheer top. Amazon did right by letting us return it and get another nice dress. Thank you Amazon!!!


I purchased the dress for my daughter.  She loves it and it's very flattering on her.  She does have to wear either a clear strap or strapless bra with this dress.


Products arrived exactly as described and in a timely manner.  Great quality and price.  Highly recommend. Runs small at least 1 size up.


I'm 5'0" and bought an XS. It fits great in length and the material actually thicker than what I thought it would be so that's a bonus. It makes a great dress for weddings, parties, graduation, church, or even work! It's not at all skimpy, but it's also not a grandma dress to it so you can wear it anywhere. I felt pretty sassy in it!


This dress it amazing. I got a small and I'm about 5'5" and 130lbs. It fit just right. I wore it to a dance I went to with my dad (it's a long run tradition) and its looked great for that but still able to go out after in. Highly recommended. Super comfy.


I bought this dress for my sister's wedding after searching endlessly in stores. This fits like a dream and hugs all the right places. I'm in love with it already and I just got it in the mail two days ago! The color looked a bit more maroon online than red, but in real life it's like a dark red. i also couldn't tell online how long it would be, but it comes to right above my knee. I love this dress!


I LOVE THIS DRESS! wore it to a concert it was very comfortable! I have a tummy and this dress hid that perfectly! Nice length up to my knees and the yellow was perfect!


This dress is very cute and the sizing guide is perfect.  It lands just above the knee. Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€� and ordered a small.  The salmon is a very pretty color and really nice material.


Beautiful dress.  Good quality. Being an XL with a shorter torso, the style didn't look as well on me as I liked. It looked good with a waist shaper but still wasn't flattering on me. I think it'd look better on someone who isn't 5'1 and 160 lbs.
