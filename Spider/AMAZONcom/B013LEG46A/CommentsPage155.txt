Needed a dress quickly for an awards dinner for my 13-year old. For the price, the dress was very good quality and fit great. My daughter got a lot of compliments on it.


I want my money back. This dress is not what I wanted. How can I send it back


Its a bit short for my 6' body but other than that it's perfect


Dress is great! Purchased for Mardi Gras Party and the purple looks great! Very stretchy and comfortable.
