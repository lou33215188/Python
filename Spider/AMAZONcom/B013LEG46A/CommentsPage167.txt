Great Great value for the price. The perfect LBD. The bottom is quite wide and the material is quite sturdy but I see these as pros as they make the dress seem pricier than it was.  I am 5'2" 180lbs, usually I wear an XL but this dress runs quite large. I got a L and there is still some room. The material is very stretchy. The mesh also feels quite sturdy. The length comes to my knees which is a bit longer than I like, but great for the work dinner that I purchased it for!!


Great price, great dress, great fit!


Beautiful dress, great price. I'm a size 10 with 36D chest and ordered a medium and it fits great.


Read the size chart clearly keeping your neck line and mid section in mind or you will end up with the wrong size


Fabulous dress.  Fit was perfect and you can't beat the price.


5'10", 145 lbs, medium fits perfectly and the skirt falls to about mid-thigh


The dress is slightly wider than expected, but over all great quality.


Loved it!


I love my dress. It fits perfectly. I had to go by the sizechart and it was spot on. I also love the quick delivery.


It was a very nice fabric and very comfortable. My problem was with the fitting. I am a very busy girl that has an athletic body.  It fit well around my shoulders and chest but was too large from the chest down.
