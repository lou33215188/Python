I got a XL, I think I should have gotten XXL. It shows my tummy area to much in my opinion. It was a nice dress with a cardigan over it. I’m about 5’8 200lbs.


Really liked the material, seemed comfortable and good quality. Usually wear small, ordered small. Fit more like medium to me.


The fabric is smooth and not flimsy and does not feel or look chinsy or cheap.


It appears to be well made though I haven't had it for very long to test its durability.


I am 5'0 and 120 lbs and usually get a small size; the small for this dress was a good fit for me.


The sweetheart style is a bit low, but with the lace/mesh, it is not noticeably so.


The fabric is thick and what could be stretchy. It hangs well I feel. Had to iron it of course but I love it. I'm 5'4 and 125 I got the small and it was fine. Maybe coulda even been tighter. It goes close to my knees and is flattering.


Pretty awesome dress! Thought it was going to be a little short but surprisingly it fits great! I’m 6 feet and it hits my knees! Nice amount of stretch but doesn’t get see through.


The wife says its very nice and fits just right, we will most likely purchase others in different colors.


This dress is just great... First arrived in time. Second you can't tell by looking at It and touching it that is a good material. Third it Fits perfectly... If your are looking for a dress that you can wear on date nigh or an event this is it Ladys...


The material is thick and stretchy. I got a size larger than I normally wear, and although it was comfortable, it was snug because of the thickness of the material. I got compliments on it, but I personally didn’t like it as much as I’d hoped to based on the other reviews. That’s my personal preference though, and honestly, it’s well made and very cute on the hanger.


Love this!!! The a line makes my waist look so tiny! Thick good quality material!
