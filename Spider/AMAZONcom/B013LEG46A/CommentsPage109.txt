I LOVE IT. The fabric is amazing, it fits perfect and its a beautiful dress all around. I am taking it with me to Italy in May. Thank you Heloise. Please make more dresses same style but diff design.


Update: I now have 4 colors. I do love them. I wear them all of the time


It fits perfectly. I'm "well portioned" and it fit better than I expected! I'm wearing it for two occasions coming up and I'll update if I find any issues.


The dress fits nice and can easily be dressed up or down. I did buy a size up only because it is a little fitted in the waist and it worked perfect!


Cute dress for my preteen, was a little big but very cute!!!?


Great product for the price. Fit perfectly. I'm 5"4 125 pounds with a 30 c chest. I got a small. The fabric is thick. The product is well made and seems to be made of good quality.


The dress was fitting and loose at the same time. On the back of the dress towards the bottom of the zipper the dresses bulged out. Not noticible under a jacket. I really liked the dress. Would probabaly order a different one in another color.


Perfect, bought for my wedding in January and is just what I wanted. Fits great, material feels amazing and the skirt is the perfect length not too short or too long. Very happy customer


I took a chance when ordering this dress, but I'm so glad I did! Fits PERFECTLY, it's strechy enough I'm 5'1 and it hits just below the knee and the top is cut very nicely. I'll be buying more colors for sure!


Fit great looks great to


This dress is gorgeous. I bought it for a wedding I'm in this month and it's perfect. The material isn't too heavy, it's soft and airy. I'm 4'10 116 lbs 34D-29.5-37 and the medium fits great. I'll be purchasing another in a different color. :)
