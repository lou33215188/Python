High quality material, runs a tad big


128lb - 5'4" - ordered size medium


I like it, but I had to buy another dress for my formal occasion.  It wasn't formal enough, but cute and fits good


I never know what size to order offline but the only "complaint" I would have is the zipper isn't the easiest to pull up. Other from that I love it. It's the perfect length and super comfy material it isn't see through with i love and it's not a super hot material either.


Dress is too cute!! Definitely fits me well and just what I expected.


Amazing dress runs true to size!


Omg, I love this dress! The material is very nice. I get really nervous buying clothes from vendors or stores that I don't know. I took the chance and very pleasantly pleased with the everything (how it fitted, the feel of the material, and the price!). I love it so much, I bought another one for my niece. :-)


Love this dress!! It's light, sexy and fit nicely.


Dress is super cute and flattering. I had bought a small that was just a little too snug so I tried the medium and it was a little too big. I feel like Goldilocks!


its pretty very plain but fits nice


The dresss fit my granddaughter as expected, with the exception it was really short! She is 5'7" and would have had to wear leggings under it to wear it. It's best suited for a person 5'4" or under in the length. It was cute through. I returned it.
