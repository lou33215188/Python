Adorable dress.  Fabric feels great and is thick and not see through making it look much more expensive.  I usually wear a size XS (5'8"  127lbs) but i went with a S with this as some of the other reviews said it ran a bit small.  i could have fit with an extra small, as the small was a little bit big on the bottom for me - but the small was very comfortable on the top.  I'm quite small chested so I can see needing to order a size up if your not.  Loved the dress will totally wear again soon.


After reading reviews I ordered a size up and it for perfectly. I struggle finding good dresses bc I am a 38 DD but am only 5ft 2in. It had plenty of room for my boobs and was the perfect length for me. It did hug me a little in the middle. I loved the deep purple with lace. I can't wait to wear it again!


The skirt was a little larger and longer than I expected, but it's not too much. I'm wearing this dress to my Winter Formal High School dance and it is very elegant looking. The big skirt makes it a little more formal and so it's perfect for an occasion like my dance. Overall I'm very satisfied with this product but I would make sure you know that the skirt is a little larger than I expected. I'm 5' 4.5" and weigh 120 lbs so I'm pretty much a small in everything. This dress fits me very nicely in the top: snug but not too tight, and the skirt hits me just above the knees and has a flare that's a little larger than my shoulder-span. I wouldn't say I have broad shoulders but I do have a little larger than normal I think. It fits and looks very classy so I would definitely recommend it. I hope this helps!


Great material and it is a little long for me.  I am 5 feet tall and about 100 lbs so I got the extra small.  Love the fit and can always fix the length:)


Xl fit much larger.  The white is gorgeous.  The bottom has a bit more extra material then I like and wouldve had it taken in if I wold have kept it.  May order it again in a medium.  Currently wear xl.


I'm 5'7 170lbs and 36DD and this dress actually fit, sorta. I wish the top material was a little stretchier to fit my boobs for comfortably. I don't want to go up a size because then its too baggy around my waist. Its not a bad dress, it just didn't go well with my figure, returning but may try a different style/mesh.


For the price, I give this four stars. The fabric is nice and the dress is quite pretty. The waist is a little odd. If you have a prominent rib cage like I do  it's not as flattering. It's not obviously a cheap dress, though the fit around the wait is not ideal.


I usually wear size 10 dresses, 5' 7" 165lbs, I ordered a large, which fit me well.


Wow! Blown away by this simple dress, I swear it's like the sister hood of the traveling pants,  it looks good on everyone! I bought the wine red for my anniversary night, which is close to Christmas, and I cannot wait to wear it! It fits great! Not too short, and really good quality. I might have to get a few more colors hobestly.....


I bought this dress in a small based on other reviews. It fit perfectly. I ended up hemming it slightly to make it a bit shorter and more "fun." The material is much nicer then you'd expect a dress at this price to be and it's very comfortable to wear. I can't wait to wear it again.


Gorgeous dress. Such a great deal for the price. I have ordered a small and the dress has a great fitting. It makes your hips look slim and your body long. It also makes your legs so much longer. I would deifinelty recommend it.ğŸ‘�ğŸ˜�
