i like the material a lot - easy to iron, soft and comfortable. The waist was a bit small, but I expected that based on the photo. I would say the measurements are a bit off, as I got a small and have a bigger waist than the dimensions listed, but it still fit me properly (maybe this is due to the stretch of the fabric). I love all the different colors and options for the chest portion and would probably buy again in another color for another wedding. Definitely recommend this dress as it is super flattering.


I loved this dress! It was classy and casual at the same time. It was a heavier material for the skirt and it kept my legs warm when I tried it on. I was sad that the mesh on the top had a tear in it and I could not wear it to my event, however it is a dress I would buy again. It was comfortable, soft and the perfect base for a light jacket/ cardigan.


This dress is perfect for something between super formal, and casual. You can dress it down or dress it up. It is VERY flattering. I am 5'2 and weigh about 125 and am a B cup. I ordered a small. This has been my favorite online purchase. I've never been more pleased with an item. It's very soft but a sturdy material, not sheer or see-through (well made, not cheap material) not too tight around the armpits either. All I can say is I put this dress on and felt pretty. It's tight and loose in the right places, room to breathe, soft, we'll made, flattering, girl what are you waiting for?! Go buy it!


I absolutely love this dress. I got so many compliments on it. I love the way it fits. I am 5'2 130 pounds 36 dd ( seeing other peoples sizes helped me pick mine) I got a M and L . I wore the M and returned the L. I will definitely by buying other colors in this dress! Could not be happier.


Purchased XL. I'm 5'9 181lbs. Fit perfect. Quality is wonderful. Good push up bra n I looked perfected for my bridal shower. Came on time as well. 2 Day shipping. ğŸ¤—


This dress is a pleasant surprise! I needed a white dress in a pinch and didn't even bother to read the reviews before purchasing. Had I read the reviews I probably wouldn't have been so surprised at how great this dress is! The material is heavy and stretchy, which allows for comfort and a flattering fit. The skirt of the dress is very full -- fuller than I expected from looking at the picture, but I like it regardless. The white is definitely more of an off-white. I usually wear a size 6 or 8 dress and the Medium fit perfectly.


Loved this dress! Color is spot on and it is very well made. It was just a bit snug at a large on me( I usually am a 12 in a dress) I say buy this dress at the next size up when you are under 5â€™ and even though it has stretch my lady lumps were too visible as far as my back fat. Iâ€™


I am 34j cup, 34 waist and 48 1/2 hips. Iâ€™m very curvy at 185. lbs.


Super cute dress & great quality for the price. It's really soft and comfortable. I'm 5'6" and 145 pounds and ordered a medium. Mind you, I do have a really small waist and this fit me so consider that when buying. Overall, really excited to wear it to wear it to my upcoming dress.


Size 16, 53 years old (more tummy) purchased an XL.


This dress is exceptional!!  Fits me perfectly.  Very slimming.  Lace draws the eye upwards, away from tummy area but it just fits the "right" way.


Not tight just flows over problems.


Adorable dress! quality of the dress is fine, a little on the heavier side, but i bought this to use as a bridesmaids dress and I think it'll work perfectly! Elegant and not too revealing. Lace puts such a great touch to the dress! I'm 5'5" 130lbs small busted (34A) and this dress looks great!  I ordered a medium and it fits me just well. Not too tight and not too loose.
