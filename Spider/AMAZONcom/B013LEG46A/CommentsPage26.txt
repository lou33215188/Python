Pretty dress can easily be dressed down bought it for my birthday but don't like how it casual it looks.


This dress is beautiful it looks amazing beyond happy it's a thick fabric but feels really nice decent length just don't touch your toes lol


Lovely little dress.  There is a bit more room around the waist than I would prefer but I really can't go down a size without taking away the room I need up top.  Really a very nice dress for all occasions, great coverage, great stretch, super comfortable and flattering, yet well priced.  I got the medium for my 37-30-37 figure.  You really can't go wrong here.


This dress actually fit pretty much exactly to size, unlike a lot of dresses on Amazon. The cut is nice and flattering on those of us who are a little more curvy as well. I didn't even need to unzip the dress to take it on and off since the material is stretchy enough that you can just pull it over your head. I ordered the Large, and I'm 4'11" / about 160lbs


First when I opened and looked the dress  a thought, don't fit, cause  seen little  but for my surprise when I decide to try it, fit me just perfect omg  i get in love with this dress  ,everything is the best ,hit exactly to my knees  ,material is stretched, made my body look beautiful, ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜€


i love. this dress


Very cute dress. Going on a cruise for my 35th anniversary and I can't wait to wear it. Love the color, the fit, the length. I'll probably hand wash this because after all it wasn't an expensive purchase so I didn't expect high quality material but it's nice and I love it.


I really like the design of the dress! It can be dressed up for more formal occasions, but can be dressed down too, to wear casually! The color is beautiful, as well as the lace design. It's made very well, with thick, stretchy fabric, and is my favorite dress! I plan on buying a couple more in different colors!


The overall fit was as expected, but it didn't quite work for me. I'm petite, so the lace came down too far, and the waist of the dress started too low. Other than that, it is a nice dress and good quality for the price.


Dress is great but the dress arrived with a run in the mesh in the chest area. Attempting to Ship it back for a replacement. Will update the review if seller makes it right.


Updated- amazon easily made it right and quickly processed refund so I was able to order replacement. Happy customer and a cute dress.
