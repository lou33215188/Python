I ordered a medium and this fit me perfectly! I love the lace at the top. I will be ordering more in other colors.


I got a large based on a review that said "I'm 5'5" and about 135 pounds. The dress fit fine, I just wish it was a tad smaller."  I'm 5'2.5 and 160 lbs so I got a large, I'm about a dress size 10-12.  It fits almost perfectly!  I can't wait to wear this out to my bachelorette party, it fits almost perfectly!  However, while the white isn't what I'd call "see-through," you could tell a person is wearing even a white thong through the material. I would def recommend!


Love it!


Beautiful !!!


Great dress!


Wrong Item,  Wrong Color Did Not Order Dis Item


Love the dress but somewhat smaller than I expected

loved this dress! so comfortable and gives in all the right places!


I love this dress.  The fit is perfect.  I bought it to wear for my sons wedding coming up in July.  I also plan to get a blingy belt to dress it up a bit.
