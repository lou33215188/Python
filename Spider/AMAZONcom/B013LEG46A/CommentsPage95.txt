I bought this for my 12 year old daughter (Size Small). It exceeded my expectations!  Super cute and appropriate for her age and she loves it!


Bad fit on me but the dress is cute and the material is good quality.


Daughter loves it


I love this dress!  Bless you for showing it to me


I was a little worried this might fit too snug but it turned out to be a perfect fit for something ordered online! I'm a 14/16 so I got this in xl and it turned out great.


I am 5â€™4 120 pounds. The small fits great. I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. It is well made, the material is thick, and it has a flattering fit. I would definitely recommend this dress, especially for the price!


Bought this for my girlfriend, she looks great in and she loved it!


Beautiful price more beautiful dress.


Great quality! I bought this dress for engagement pictures and it looked stunning. I received lots of compliments. I highly recommend this dress!


Ordered for a wedding and it looked and fit perfect!
