I bought this dress in purple and it is wonderful quality and fits perfectly. It shipped so quickly and I couldn't be more excited! I needed a dress to wear to a wedding and didn't find anything I liked in the stores, I turned to Amazon and am amazed by how nice this dress is. I'll probably order again in another color for any event that pops up!


My niece love the dress she said it's perfect her birthday out fit she wore and got tremendous compliments  on it

LOVE this dress! I'm 5'6" and I wear size 16 pants -  the XX-Large was very flattering! The dress part is a thick but stretchy material, the lease is a kind of shiny synthetic type of material. It looks very nice once it's on, not sure how it washes yet though. It's a great little black dress for the price!


This dress was PERFECT! It came in on time and fit amazing. The fabric is thicker and has some stretch to it which is nice. I was also worried that the lace would irritate my skin, but it did not. It was such a comfortable dress to have to wear all day. It was definitely worth the buy. I may even buy another in a different color!


Fabric feels soft and good quality. Fits great and super flattering for my 'just had a baby and can't stop eating because I'm nursing" belly!
