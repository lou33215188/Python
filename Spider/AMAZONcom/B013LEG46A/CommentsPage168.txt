Love the way it fits.


I'm 4'11" and the XS fit so well! It ended just at the knees. The upper part is a lil see through, just saying. Otherwise it's perfect!


This dress fits perfectly! I'm 5'6 and about 215. I both the xl and it fits and is very comfortable.


A little big around the waist for me, but otherwise fits great and is a great material.


Love it. Tons of compliments.


Wow!  This dress is perfect.  True to size, great thick material that hangs very nicely, GREAT price!  What more could you ask?  Perfect.


I love the dress and it was a perfect fit.


Nice thick fabric, very flattering! Fit was as expected.


Very nice dress. Great fit and material. Defiantly worth the price


Really pretty and super comfy! It fits a little big on me but not to bad. Can get away with eating more donuts!
