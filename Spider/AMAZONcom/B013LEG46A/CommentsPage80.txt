Loved the dress, it fit perfectly, was adorable on.


A little large for my daughter but we liked it enough to keep it until she grows into it.


Love it, but a little too small


Cute dress but didn't fit me so had to send it back.


It's kinda long but good material


Love everything about this dress! It's true to size and the fabric is amazingly soft! It would be better if it was a little shorter. I'm 5'3 and the dress reaches (a little) past my knees. Maybe because I'm short, but other than that. Everything else is great.


I’m a size 12/14, 5’4 and this dress fits me like a glove! I ordered a large and it fits 100% as expected. The fabric feels great on my skin and the color (burgundy) is gorgeous. I can’t wait to wear this to my company Christmas party!


Cute dress


I love my new dress. Simple but same time sexy


Loved it !!! Bought it for my wedding reception.
