I'm 5'4 212lbs. This dress is stunning. Dress up or down. I get tons of compliments! It's soft and thick. I wore it in the summer and fully plan to wear it in the fall and winter. Ordered in other colors as well!


Very cute dress, the top fit me just fine but since I am petite, 5'3 it was a bit of an awkward length. I realize that isn't an issue with the dress so I gave it 5 stars, but if you are short and need a larger size, just keep it in mind.


Looks nice on my daughter.


The dress fits beaitifully.  It is for a wedding.  I looked beautiful in it.  The aline  dress has the perfect length.


okay fit, but cheap fabric. see through and feels low quality. construction is ok.


Based on reading previous comments I ordered my dress a size M, I'm not skinny and I'm not chubby and the dress does not fit right. It's loose on the waist and chest.


I can't say I'm totally unsatisfied with this purchase because the fabric is nice and if I had ordered a size S it would have been perfect. I will still be wearing this dress :)


My daughter picked this out for graduation. She is 5-10, a little short waisted and the sizing was perfect for her.  It will be perfect under her grad gown and later at semi-formal dinner.


Too tight around the middle, too big around the top.


Fit fine, it just looked really cheap do I returned it.


Love this dress.  Perfect fit for my daughter. I ordered it for her prom and she loves it.  Good quality and has some  stretch to it.  The material is nice and thick and doesn't wringle.
