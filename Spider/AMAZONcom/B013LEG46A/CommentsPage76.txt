nice dress


LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress! Fits well and looks flattering.


Beautiful!


Love this dress, it's amazing


Bought to use for a halloween costume. A little larger and longer than i expected which is good, made for real US sizes.  Good quality. I want another!


It looked fine to me, but the person I purchased it for did not like the style.  I have returned the item..


Great dress for the price. Fit very well and is a perfect LBD. Dress was perfect for elegant night on our last cruise. I paired with some black heels and a cardigan. It was comfortable and versatile.  Would recommend!


Cute dress, well made. Agree it is a heavier material but it hangs well. I ordered a medium. I'm 5'4, 130, 34C and it fits, hangs just above my knee. Recommend


I bought this dress as a bridesmaids dress for a wedding. The wedding hasn't happened yet, I will post photos after the event, but I have tried it on and it's so comfortable, so beautiful, and it's appropriate and perfect for the occasion. I want to order more in other colors just to have! As other reviewers have said, the material is not cheap-feeling. I normally wear about a medium, but the size chart said a small was a 4-6 so I ordered a small and it fits perfect. LOVE THIS DRESS! Can't wait to wear it.


*UPDATE* so comfortable and cute! Perfect for the wedding I was in!


The dress fit perfect
