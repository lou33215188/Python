Was exactly as expected and completely true what everyone says. This dress is beautiful and helps pull everything in. It is almost the perfect little black dress


Love! Love! Love! I ordered one in blue & one in white, I have worn them both & received many compliments!


I am usually between a medium and a large - 5'5" and 150 lbs, but this dress was perfect!!! I ordered the large and it honestly was perfect. A little big on the top but the medium would have been a snug fit and I don't like my clothes too tight. These really are true to size. I ordered it in black and in navy!!! Absolutely stunning and elegant!! I wore it for my nephews baptism with a chunky silver gem necklace and nude pumps. And I'm wearing them again next week for my two dinner for my office'space conference in Miami!!


I have never gotten this great of quality for so cheap! Excellent! Lace is defiantly  high quality won't string or fall apart. Looks just like the pic! I'm sure turned heads at my sister-in-laws wedding


I bought this dress for my Snow Ball dance and loved it!  The dress was shipped on time, and in great shape when it arrived. The dress fit like a glove, and the material is great quality. I definitely recommend this dress. There are so many occasions it can be worn to! Very versatile! I can not sa enough about this dress!


Fits pretty good. The wine color is nice. I ordered a small, I'm 5'2", 128lbs and pear shaped ğŸ˜„. It fit longer than I'd like it to be but it's still really nice on with heels. It's very comfortable. The mesh part isn't itchy. Fabric is good quality especially for the price.


I love this dress! It is flattering, it runs true to size, & it feels great on! It is so hard to find a dress that you can say all three of these things! Great dress with a great price tag!


I love this dress it was comfortable one of the best fitting dresses ever I definitely would buy it again and all the colors that they have


This is a super cute and well fitting dress. I liked where the hem fell on my body, not too long or short. I was worried that this dress would hug my in all of the wrong places, but it actually looked really flattering. Would order again if I needed another one.


Very versatile dress. Worn for school dances and even a couple of funerals.


Washes and wears well. Great price. I would recommend this dress in a heart beat.
