Love this dress! It's an appropriate length and it fit perfectly! Definitely recommend it!


Very elegant look! Perfect for wedding!


Great product, good quality!


I love the dress! I bought it for a wedding. Only problem I have with it is that it is too long. I might have to get it hemmed.


The dress is better than expected only because of the cheap price. Fabric and fit are great. Does not look cheap.  Love it.


I thought I ordered the all navy dress, not the dress with the black on top


Beautiful cut, quality fabric...only negative was that it stated it is white online and what arrived is off white. I love it and still intend to wear it!


Was a really cute dress, nice quality fabric too. Just didn't like how it looked on me is all!


I ordered this dress in white size XS. Found it to be true to size and a good quality for the price. 8inaould definitely recommend it!


Super cute wore to wedding. Fit perfectly.  Usually wear a 12 and fit great. 5'5. 170lbs
