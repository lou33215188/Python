Awesome dress for the price.  heavy weighted material which makes the dress lay great on the body.  Love Love Love it!


This dress came ontime and fit perfectly.


The material is very heavy. So it. Would be wonderful for winter where it it gets very cold.


This dress fit me really well.. I'm 5'2" and about 120lbs. I got the small.  The only bad part is you will have to wear a strapless bra because you will be able to see the straps.


Beautiful dress for the money but is a couple of sizes smaller than stated.


Love this dress.


Fits perfectly! Love the color and the way it fells. Is a lil heavy but nice :)


Fit wasn't as expected


I brought this for my wife. she love it. here is her review. " it fits perfectly i wear size 12-14 i order XL and its perfect for me. I have order red color but it bit different then what you see in image, also the material is good smooth and soft but this whole dress is quit heavy may be because of material and XL size. overall it is good buy"


True to size and great quality.
