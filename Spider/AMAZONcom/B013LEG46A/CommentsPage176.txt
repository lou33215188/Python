Perfect  loved it


I would've given this dress 5 starts buy I am a little disappointed in the style/sizing of the dress between the Small vs. Medium in Black.  My daughter kept the black dress in small as it was ok but wanted to see if the medium would give her a little more time to wear it before she grew out of it.  She is 5'9 and weighs 120 lbs.  The medium came and it was not the same dress; it had a different mesh towards the top and not the beautiful flowered pattern of the small.  Why the difference? Not sure...the medium was way more "boxy" cut too.  She will look beautiful in the small and it will work for the 2 events she needs it for.  The material is soft, comfortable and it is a super-cute dress for the price.


This is such a nice dress for the price.


One size to small


Great value, drapes well, true to size


Absolutely beautiful! I ordered the light green and it is perfect for any spring special occasion.
