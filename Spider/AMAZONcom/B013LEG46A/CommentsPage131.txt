not to my likings


Good dress for the price. It is very long if you are short but we just had it hemmed.


Such a cute dress for the inexpensive price!!! I wear a 12 and the large was perfect!


Love the dress! I have gotten tons of compliments!


Very well made. Shipped quickly. The only issue I had was the zipper would stick when trying to put it on or take it off. Otherwise, very nice dress!


Ended up returning it. Nothing really wrong with the dress it just looks a little different in hand


I was afraid it wasn't going to look right, I even thought it would look cheap, but it did not; the quality of this dress is awesome and the fit is perfect.  I bought  6 Royal Blue for brides maids dresses.


The dress is adorable but it is kind of an off white, other than that it fits great and is very cute on!


Just what my daughter wanted


it works, well made
