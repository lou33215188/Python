The fit is good and the fabric quality is great.


Loooove this dress. It is a very flattering cut and not too short for my taste. The fabric has some stretch to it making it very comfortable, but not diminishing the dressiness. It also packs/travels well resisting wrinkles. A wonderful purchase!


Super cute dress. I'm 5'1" and 140 lbs and the medium was a tiny bit snug on my torso but everywhere else fit perfectly.


I absolutely love this dress. Wore it New Years Eve for a wedding. I highly recommend it. I bought the color black and wore a beige strapless bra and you couldn’t really see the bra strap in back.


Fits great on 5'3" tall person


Great dress. Exactly as described.


Nicer than expected. True to size. Was in a pinch to get a LBD quickly for an event. It did not disappoint. I’ve worn it a couple times now.


Was very happy with it. The fit was good and quality ok. You do get what you pay for, but it worked great for a new years eve party!!


At first I thought it would be too short in the back and a little tight ( I've recently lost weight so wasn't too sure of my dress size) but the material is great. It's super comfortable and perfect for wedding season


The fabric, look and overall quality are nice but I got an extra small for my teenage step daughter who has a very athletic build and it was HUGE. The top came down to the center of her bra and the bottom of the dress went way past her knees.
