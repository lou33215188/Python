Love love love this dress


This dress is so comfortable and fits perfectly.


The quality and fit is amazing! It is true to size, I love it!


To start off, this dress is absolutely adorable. It's simple, looks classy and is great for pretty much any occasion. Most women could order this dress and be happy with the way it flatters their form. However, for those who are more petite than others, you may want to reconsider. As of when I ordered this, the smallest size they had on any color was a small. I ordered it, and it came exactly when it was supposed to. I put it on, and it is an adorable dress. However, on me, it is somewhat large. It doesn't cling to my curves like it does on other women, on me, it hides them. I'm 5'1 and 88lbs so I am a really skinny girl. I have wider hips for my size but my waist and frame are small. While the dress hugs my hips, my waist is too small and the dress makes it look nonexistent, along with my chest. Regardless, I still wear the dress to work because it is a nice dress but unless more sizing options become available, I hope my fellow petites are aware that it may not accentuate your assets and body the way it it does for other women.
