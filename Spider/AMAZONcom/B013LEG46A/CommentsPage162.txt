Great dress especially for the price.  My 15yr old daughter loves it!


I brought the dress for my daughter and she loved it!


I didn't like the fabric tho.


Nice dress pretty color


This dress fits true to size. It was a little longer than expected but nothing a little hemming won't fix. Otherwise it's perfect.


I love this dress. Perfect fit and just the right length. Very happy with my purchase. My husband loves it as well!


Great quality. Fit like a glove. Very classy look.
