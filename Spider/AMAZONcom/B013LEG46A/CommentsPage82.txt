Awesome dress, my daughter loves it. Got her a small she is 12 5'1"


I loved this dress. I wore it as my reception dress and it was so comfortable while also looking fantastic. It's also made of a pretty thick material, so it's warm and there's no fear of anyone seeing your underwear or bra.


Love this dress.


it is exactly as expected and if fits wonderfully.


The color is beautiful and is very complimenting.


Will recommend.


My daughter loved the dress. It was flattering and very comfortable. She’s about 190lbs and 5’6 and we got the size large (it stretches!).


Not at all bad, especially for how low cost it is.


Beautiful dress, very flattering!


Love it! Going to buy another in a different color.


This dress is amazing! I have never bought any clothing on amazon and I am so glad I did I'm 5'5 and 150 pounds and I got a medium and I look amazing in this dress It fits like a glove and I definitely plan on buying this dress in more colors


In love with this dress. I'm 5'3'' and about 140 lbs. I'm tiny but muscular with a broad chest. Unfortunately I only got one wear out of this dress because the second time I put the dress on, the zipper broke immediately. In the process of getting it fixed my a tailoring service. I'd like to buy the dress in a different color but I'm afraid it will fall apart just like the first one.


Great fit, beautiful dress!
