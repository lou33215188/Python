Love this dress and the fabric, great choise


I actually expected it to fit small. I love how the necline accentuates my assets. I also like that the material is not thin and flimsy.


Great dress. Sent as a gift and recipient loved it.


very nice for the price.


Loved the material, good quality although it didn't fit. It was a bit bigger and longer than it showed in the picture. I weigh 112 and 5'1.


Dress looks good but a little short I'm 5'9 next 150 lb


It is PERFECT! I am in love with this dress!! It isn't snug, it's the perfect length, and it honestly suits my figure and I couldn't be happier <3


Absolutely loved this dress!!! It fit perfectly, a friend and I ordered this dress for a Halloween party. She had ordered small and I medium, both of us feel in love with it. Would recommend this dress to anymore!!!


Great dress! Fit wonderfully.


Beautiful dress! For great, looked amazing.
