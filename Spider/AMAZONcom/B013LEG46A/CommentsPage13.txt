I have ordered this dress in two colors and two sizes. I first ordered the dark navy blue dress, about a year ago, in a size small. The fit was just a little snug. But it was a great quality dress and not to short (I'm 6 foot). The second dress I ordered was the wine red with black lace. The wine red color is a bit more red than the picture made it look. I ordered a medium for this dress, because I wanted a little extra length. However, it was a bit too loose. Which is my fault. But this dress is a great price for a good quality fabric. (It's also thicker so it would work great for a fall/winter wedding)


I needed a dress last minute for a wedding and I found this one on here. It was extremely highly rated and for good reason. The dress is a nice thicker material, but still cool enough for dinner events. I debated between the small and medium and ended up with the small. It fit perfectly, just a tad small in the arms. But I have wide shoulders too. For reference, I am 5'3 and about 135 lbs. Would order this dress again in another color!

This dress is amazing, I originally bought it in yellow but decided to buy it in black to replace my old "little black dress". This dress is amazing, it's heavier weight than I would have thought for the price. The lace is the perfect level of sexy without being extremely revealing. The dress flows extremely well, while I was worried that it might be too long it hits me below the knee and I'm 5'0".


Dress is made of good quality material and I love the color. However I bought an extra small (I am 5ft 4in, 33 bust 24 waist 34 hips) and to get this dress to fit me I had to throw it in the dryer; it was definitely too big beforehand. I also have a longer torso so now that the rest of the dress fits me, the waistline of the dress now sits about an inch above where my actual waistline is. Pictures are of after I put it in the dryer.


This is the best dress I've ever bought on Amazon or online.  I love it!  Usually I order them and they're too small or too big or just fit funny but this fits perfectly.  I was concerned my chest wouldn't be covered bcz I couldn't see how see through it was but everything was covered. I got so many compliments!


Bought this dress for my husband's pharmacy school graduation. Shipping was lightening fast, 2 DAYS!!!! I don't have Amazon prime nor did I pay for shipping, and it came that fast! I ordered a white dress with the mesh top. Item looks exactly as pictured. I wear a large/extra large and bought a large. I have a DDD chest, am 5'6, and around 170-180 lbs? Dress fits perfect! It comes up a little past my knee. Flowy, stretchy, and comfortable material.


I really wanted to love this dress but it was just a bad fit for me. Also, the zipper was horrible and it caused the dress to bulge in the back. Iâ€™ve returned it.


I love this dress! I purchased the blue one a few months ago and wore it to a wedding. This is the second dress I've ordered but in black now and have yet to wear it for another special occasion. The material is of good quality. Great purchaseğŸ˜€


I ordered 3 dresses from Amazon for my company Christmas party. For reference, I'm 5'5", 130 lbs, 34D. I ordered a small and this dress fit as expected. However, I ended up returning this dress. I didn't love it as much as the others I ordered. I think this dress looks better in the pictures on Amazon than in person.


I love this dress! My daughter (16) wore it on a cruise where she played in the orchestra and it looked absolutely gorgeous on her!!  She said her only complaint was that "it made my armpits black" but I'm sure that was bc it was new and hadn't been washed properly. It was also a very heavy material, so if she would have been flying, it may not have been the best choice for lightweight clothing in luggage but I bet it felt good on a windy chilly evening on the cruise. Also watch out for drying the material as it is sheer on top. I washed and then dried on high (hot) for 5 minutes, then shook it out and hung it the rest of the way dry.  Despite all of those things, I would buy again and again!
