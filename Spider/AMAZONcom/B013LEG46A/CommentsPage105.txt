Absolutely beautiful! Nice fabric.


it was as good as the picture ! always wanted a little black dress and found THE ONE.


Great fit


I sized up in case the fabric didn't stretch enough, it's plenty stretchy. The chest pleats are in a weird spot, so make sure your bra is super supportive. Looks kind of baggy in the back.


Fit perfect


Great dress for the price. Nicely made. Doesn't wrinkle. Comfortable. Just the right length. My daughter wore it ffor a dance at school. She loved it.


Material is nice.


I absolutely love this dress! I'm 5'7" and 209 lbs. This dress was absolutely flattering!


im 100 pounds, 5'4 and the dress come down below my knees. it said it would come up above the knee and it doesnt.


Such a gorgeous dress and it's so comfortable
