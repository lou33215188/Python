Absolutely beautiful


I love it is better than the picture


Came out of the package wrinkle free. Fabric felt great. My daughter wore a medium and she is 5'9" and 155 pounds. Fit perfectly and she looked amazing. Great buy.


Runs small.


Perfect fit! Love it


I have always been hesitant to buy clothes online but this one was definitely worth it. Very comfortable and perfect fit. The length was a couple inches too long, but one I washed and dried it, it was perfect. It goes right above my knees and I look so good in it!


Fits ok it's a beautiful dress.


Bought this dress for my teen daughter for a performance in a high school jazz concert. It looks very pretty, length was perfect and accentuated her waist. What a great dress!


it was a great dress BUT the medium was too big on me :( other than that, the qaulity and style was perfect :)


I wore it for an elegant dinner, and it looked great. It fit well, and was extremely comfortable. The lace seems to be of good quality.
