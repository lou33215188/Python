This fit as expected for the most part. I ordered this hoping to use for work but it was a little more low cut (where the lace meets fabric) than expected and did not feel comfortable using it for work. Other than that it was as expected and like the photo. Light weight material


Perfect lbd. I ordered a medium and I'm 5'2", 148lb, 32D. Hits a little above the knee. I was worried it'd be too long. Bought a cute pair of black heels. Can't wait to wear it out to dinner!!!


Very cute dress, but does run a little large. I would have been fine sizing down one bc of the material.


I got so many compliments on this dress as a wedding. Everyone thought it was from some department store when really it was less than $50 on Amazon! Pretty good quality for the price


I got m (5'1" 130 lbs 34c), fit is nice, the top is just a tiny bit loose. I almost got s but it would have probably been tight. Overall, it is a very beautiful dress and long enough (down to knees for me). Might want to wash before wear, has the new factory smell to it.


This is a beautiful dress. I ordered it in burgundy for my daughter. She loved it the style and fit of it! Definitely a good steal for the price!


Dress was perfect for my daughter’s homecoming dance! Comfortable and cute! It is well made and a fantastic price! I wish I would have gone up a size though. An XL would have been a tad  better for my 5’7 and a solid 165 lb. daughter.


I brought this dress for my daughter.  She loved it, but it wad a little long.  She had to.have it altered.  A petite size would of been perfect.


I love this dress. It’s simple, and great for somewhat casual special occasions. Fits perfect for shorter women(5’2).


My daughter ordered this dress and she looks fantastic in it.  The fabric is soft and stretchy, it looks great and feels like it would be magnificently comfortable.
