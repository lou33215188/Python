Very flattering. Lace on the top has a very pretty design. Only thing that was a drawback was how much wrinkles the bottom material can get.


I love the way dress fit, the flare and makes my stomach looks small. I got it in royal .Lots compliment. Going order another. True tobsize


I wore this for graduation it fit perfectly!!


The color is nice and it fits perfectly.


Very cute! Somewhat simple so I paired it with flashy heels. Feels great and the perfect length for any occasion! (5'3 160 lbs)


Super cute dress for my 13 yr old, not too sexy but cute enough for her to feel confident with peers.


This dress is an extremely good quality-much better than I expected for the price. I've never left an Amazon comment before, but I felt compelled to for this item as I was really impressed with this brand. Good buy!
