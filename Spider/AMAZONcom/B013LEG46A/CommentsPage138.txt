Fits perfect. I wore it to a baby shower and was very comfortable in it the whole time.


Although the dress was a lighter purple than I thought it would be, I was still very pleased with it. The dress was flattering and I got a lot of and how it looked on me. It will be my go-to party dress.


What a gorgeous dress! Great quality material - it's on the thicker side but very breathable. I recommend it everyone. I'm about to buy another one in a different color!


Perfect!!!!!


Loved the style. Great fit. Good material for price.


I loved this dress! I am 5'6'' and about 140lbs and medium fit perfect!


Wonderful material. Fits great


Really heavy material, high quality, fits tighter in the chest but I originally bought a bigger size and had to send it back for a smaller size to fit me better. Wore it for graduation and a wedding looks great.


Not what I expected. Looks great online but somehow disappointed at the actual product


Great dress...loved it!!!
