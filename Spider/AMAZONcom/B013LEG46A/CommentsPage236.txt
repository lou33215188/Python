I absolutely love this dress the way it fits in the way it looks on.


Just a little to short.


Love love love ğŸ˜� I'm 5'6 and 150 lbs and it fits perfectly ğŸ˜�


Doesn't look like expected


Asked for M gave me S and totally different dress


Dressed fit as sized. Looks lovely


This dress is so cute!!! I love the bright orange color! I'm big chested so I will need to wear a good bra or there's a gap in the buttons. I love the belt! It's versatile so you can wear it in front, on the side, or in back.


I wish this dress and the black one I just bought had pockets made in them!


Material is very good, fits very nice.


Doesn't fix ad expected


Nice dress, didn't  like the fit
