This dress was really well made and fit well, I would highly recommend


I ordered a small (my measurements are 34, 26, 38) and this dress was a bit baggy. This dress was see through and you could see the overlap of the fabric near the stitching by the bust. I don't know if other colors would have that same problem. The lace just wasn't right, maybe if the dress fit better overall the lace wouldn't look so awkward. This would probably be better for a younger lady for homecoming.


A lot bigger than expecting. Great material though


the dress was really pretty except it was wayyyy too long. i had to get a different dress to wear because of the length. it went down to my knees


It's cute! Good material, fits well, good stretch to it, its thick so not see-through, I'm a fan.


Top fits nice it is very awkwardly long.. will not wear anytime soon or will have to get shortened


It was the perfect dress to wear to an outdoor wedding on the lake


Many compliments when I wore this dress. Fits great, the stretchy material made it fit very comfortably.


My roommate bought this same dress a few months earlier. I wore hers to a party and loved it so much I wanted to buy one for myself. Upon arrival, the dress was not as expected. It was MUCH smaller in not only the waist but the length as well! It was almost 3 inches shorter than my roommate's SAME dress.


The color was also off and the material was very cheap and uncomfortable.


Overall, I was very disappointed in the decline of the store's product.


Not even close to the pictures
