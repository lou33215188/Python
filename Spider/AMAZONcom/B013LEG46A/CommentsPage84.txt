fits great


Looks awesome and was very comfy


Fits well.my second dress for a different occation.


If I could give this more stars, I would. It fits exactly as I was hoping and it looks SO GOOD. I get compliments every time I wear it because it's sexy without being too revealing. I feel great when I wear it and it is super great.


Love the cut on the dress. Its very flattering on my curvy body. A little disappointed that the aqua looking one was actually mint.


This dress is beautiful, shows my curves!


I wear size 11 in juniors fits great


I absolutely loved this dress! I bought it for presentations that required formal dress and I kept getting compliments with it :) for sizing reference I’m about 5’6, 36D and I went with a large, it’s fitted but not too fitted


Great dress! Wore it to a formal dinner at Disney World and I got lots of compliments.


Super cute dress! You can't go wrong with a little black dress.  True to size and fits comfortable with good quality for the price.
