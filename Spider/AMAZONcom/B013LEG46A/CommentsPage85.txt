Great dress. Fit perfectly.


This fits according to size and it looks really cute and is comfortable! Glad I got a great dress for a great deal!


It's a really pretty dress and the fabric is a heavier/nicer fabric. It's elegant and sexy and doesn't show too much cleavage. The length is A-line and it washes up nicely--just hang dry and it's fine.


Looks beautiful and fits great!


My new favorite! The fabric is stretchy and fits great. Gorgeous dress. Love it!


Great dress! I'm almost 6' tall and it was not too short on me, hit modestly above the knee. I'm thick through my midsection and this was very flattering. I bought the XL and I wear a size 14 in most jeans, XL in most tops.


beautifull dress looks great and very good quality will order in more colors


Beautiful dress, this looks just like the picture! I love it!


This dress fits well and is great quality. I wouldn't call it a LBD though. It's very basic in the fit. I wear this to work.


Really cute dress, fit well and is made well. My daughter got extra small, she wears a 00 in Hollister pants, and XS in all of her other clothing as well. She is 5ft, 95lbs and it fit perfect.
