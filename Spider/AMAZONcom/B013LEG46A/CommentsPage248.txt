This dress is absolutely beautiful, so soft and fits perfect in all the right places. I’m bigger in my belly (thanks to two kids) and this dress makes my midsection look tiny and seemless ❤️ Definitely recommend buying oh and size fits very true


Fits a post baby body perfectly!


Very nice quality. Daughter bough it for homecoming and loved it.


This dress was STUNNING! I wore it for homecoming last year and it did not disappoint. I recommend hand-washing and air-drying this, due to the mesh-type fabric on top. I unfortunately machine washed and dried the dress and the thinner fabric tore. Sad but a lesson for you all. Other that that, it was a gorgeous dress and definitely worth it.


This dress is very simple and pretty. It fits well and the navy color is pretty.


Beautiful color excellent fit might have to wear stockings or leggings with it because of the Hem length but other than that it's perfect


Fits true to size, medium.  The zipper runs smoothly, slightly higher waist is just cute, nice flare to the skirt.  Material nice and stretchy.


The issue with this dress is the seams. In the picture it looks like it has a sewn seam in a band around the waist. What I got when I ordered was a dress that was cut and sewn very cheaply, it does not flare out it falls flat to the sides and the most irritating is that it has this cross stitching in the front. It has a seam that runs vertical the entire length of the dress and another seam that crosses the part of the dress where it should flare out. It's very distracting and is NOT the dress in the picture!!!!!


I purchased this dress for a formal event that I have this weekend and received a completely different dress and brand. I ordered an XL, as I was expecting it to be a little small, but received an Ilanni size OX black dress with long sleeves. I am very disappointed.


Beautiful.  My daughter is planning on wearing it to next year's homecoming dance at school.
