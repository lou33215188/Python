The dress fit as expected and the fabric is of a good quality.


I love these dresses!  The lighter colors do tend to stain easily, though.


Love the fit! The dress is beautiful. The mesh on top didn’t fit as good as the lace one I got. The left side didn’t lay flat like the one in on the right. It was a very comfortable form fitting dress.


Loved it. Wore it for a wedding and didn't need spanx under it because it didn't cling to my stomach


Had to return it because it was just too small, but this is a beautiful high quality dress. The fabric is thick, heavy and falls very nicely. Could be worn in a dressy setting or even a more casual one.


This dress is very very comfortable and beautiful. It fits very well and the material is breathable.


My daughter wore this dress to homecoming and it was stunning!  She likes simple and pretty and that is what we got!  Can't beat the price either!!


It was for a homecoming dance for my daughter.  She loved the way it fit and how she looked in it.  Comfortable and very pretty, what more could you ask for!  Thanks for a great product!


Just arrived today and the fit is pretty fantastic. Fabric doesn't feel cheap. I'll most likely but from this seller again.


Wore it to a wedding and got a few complements on it. No complaints whatsoever.


I really liked the dark navy blue color and the lacy top kept it classy. Good solid material which kept away creases well.
