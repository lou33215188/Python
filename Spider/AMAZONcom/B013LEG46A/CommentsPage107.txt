This dress was for our daughter's homecoming. It is a perfect fit and she looks lovely in it. Great dress not just for homecoming but for any event where a dress is required.


So nice!


Such great quality! Fits wonderful and is very flattering


Got a small based on other people's reviews and it fit like a glove.  I usually wear size 4 in dresses and this was true to size.  I am 5'5', 34d, 128lbs with hips.


Really good dress. Definitely recommend this dress to anyone. I'm only 4"11 it came to right at my knee which actually didn't look bad at all. I may hem it but it looks fine the way it is.


This dress was ordered in light blue and was exactly shown as in the picture,the size chart was very accurate. When my daughter saw it she loved it immediately took it and tried it on. It fit perfectly.


After hours of shopping at the mall I went online and Bought this dress for my daughters homecoming dance. Material is good quality and thick. Received dress in about 3 days.  Fit as expected. Very elegant looking.


Love this dress! Very happy with my purchase. I am 5'8" and bought a medium. Material is a tad heavy but very comfortable. This dress is also on the longer side but that's perfect for me being in the taller side.


Just buy it! It's adorable and perfect for a formal event! I wore mine to a wedding.


Great dress! Fit perfectly!
