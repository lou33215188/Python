The dress is beautiful, but the waist is too low. For my daughter to wear this dress that fits otherwise perfectly, we would have to shorten about 2 inches to raise the waist line. We are returning it.


I ware this dress to a school dance. It fit amazing and the material was thick enough that I was one of the only girls that's underwear didn't glow(it was a blacklight ball) and it was so soft! I loved it and I plan to order more in different colors.


Love this dress!! The fabric is soft and stretchy, and is not thin like other dresses! I’m 5’5 120lbs and wear a 36A and it fits pretty well! The back is just a little bit baggy, but for the most part, love it!


My daughter likes it.  Fits pretty well.


While the color was lighter than I expected, the dress is still quite lovely.  I love that the material is the stretchy kind, since that means it fits my small chested body without hanging awkwardly where the boobs should be.  It's a good length, and a flattering cut.  Definitely my go-to dress for special occasions.


I was so afraid that this dress won't fit me, however Amazon prove me wrong. Indeed, it feels well in me and not just that, it looks good to me as well.


This dress is probably my absolute favorite that I own now! I will definitely be ordering another one in a different color! In case anyone is curious...I am 4'10", I weigh about 150 lbs., and my bra size is 38D. A large fit me perfect! The shipping was also very fast! I'm definitely a very pleased customer. :)


This dress is for my niece for my wedding, she said it fits perfectly.


Runs a bit small but good quality, surprisingly heavy material.


I ordered the black dress with the floral lace and it was perfect! I wore it to my brother's graduation and I got lots of compliments. It fit perfectly and was modest (went to my knees) yet elegant.
