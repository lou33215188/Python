The lace is of poorer quality than I expected but overall a nice dress

I love the dress


The fabric isn't what I expected - it doesn't hang like the picture. It falls straight and clings.


I like the style and color..but it was too short for me.


Adorable and stretchy. 10/10


Very cute and flirty dress! Loved it!


My daughter absolutely loved this dress..


I loved this dress and got tons of compliments. But I didn't know how it would fit so unordered a large. I def need a med.


Perfect fit! Fabric and stitching are great quality! I can't wait to wear this on my next cruise!
