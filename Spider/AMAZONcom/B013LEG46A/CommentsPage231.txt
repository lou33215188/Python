Beautiful dress..


Kind of baggy, not as form fitting around the top and middle. Otherwise nice.


I ordered three of these and only got 1 of the right ones, but the one I did get looks and feels amazing! My girls are going to love these! Bridemaids dresses!!


This dress is true to the size chart. It did fit me weird and hugged my stomach which didn't look good. The shipping was super fast. Probably will take it back.


The dress arrived with a broken zipper.  I thought the quality was low at best.


Size Xs fitted my sister size M


Nice white dress


The material was really cheap looking. I guess for the price it has to be.


It was a good looking dress, but returned it.


It's cute and comfy material except I'm a plus size women so I got the biggest sized they offered and it was still small


Very pretty dress.
