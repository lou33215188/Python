Fits perfectly


I am 5'2, 107lbs and ordered a small. The product is a heavy quality material, however, it looks "dragged down"...just sort of hangs on the body. I have a large bust (32DD) and it did fit that area, however, it was very loose in the midsection. Also, because I am short, this was NOT a flattering dress on me. Where as someone who is tall this dress may come up above knee-height, it came below knee height on me and sat at a very odd length. I had to return as this- just was not flattering.


Love this dress! Great quality and fits perfect !
