Pretty but I could not unzip dress to try it on because I didnâ€™t want to break the zipper. It wouldnâ€™t budge.


I just received this dress yesterday. I'm 5'8 and wear a size 7-8 and the dress fit fine. The length of it hit me right above the knee. It is a heavier weight dress and it looks just okay on me. I feel like the price I paid was higher than the value of the dress IMO. $37. I received it in red. Probably looks best in black though.


I purchased this product and ordered an xs but still found it to be too long on meğŸ˜•  I am 5' for reference


Got perfectly and came on time. Zipper a little hard to zip up in certain spots. But worked very well for my bachelorette party


Pretty dress. I bought a large and it fit perfectly.


Great fabric and cute dress. It's nice for those ladies who have a little bit bigger of a chest. (I'm a DD)


This dress is absolutely beautiful, and surprisingly well made. Iâ€™ve recently lost weight and was stoked to wear the medium perfectly (for reference Iâ€™m 5â€™5â€�, 148lbs, 34D). Follow the size chart and youâ€™ll be fine!


Brah...this dress is magical. I don't know what material it's made of but it's some good s**t. I checked my mail after a full, complete dinner and the dress hid my belly. Hid it! And I have an awkward hip shelf and hip dip that some dresses accentuate (which sucks) but this beauty, she was kind to all my unflattering areas. Plus, it's gorgeous. Like 20/10, would recommend.


Also; I'm 5'4" and 125-130 pounds, not chesty. Ordered a medium. Fits like the fairy godmother herself tailored it to me.


I LOVE this dress! I'm 5'4 and 250lbs and the XXL fit me great. It's really hard finding clothes that look good on my frame and I'm so happy with this purchase.


Love this dress, great quality, great price!
