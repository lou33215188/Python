I thought this dress was too short for me.


love this dress; especially for the price!


Dress was amazing and comfortable. Better then I expected it to be ! I'm 5"4 and 133 pounds and I bought a small it fit perfectly.


This dress fit exactly how i thought. True to the size guide. Very flattering to all body types.


This dress fit as expected and was very comfortable!  I wore it all day with no problems.


Lovely dress...True to size


Runs just a tad large. My chest is a 34, and the Small size is just a bit baggier than I imagined and apparently fits 33 to 35 in


Exactly how it looks in the pictures. A little bit heavy but very sturdy. I'm 5'3", 115 lbs, 34C. Ordered a small and it fit perfectly. Came on time. Definitely buy, it's perfect.


The top lace area is cut a little lower than I would have liked, but over all pretty and good fit.
