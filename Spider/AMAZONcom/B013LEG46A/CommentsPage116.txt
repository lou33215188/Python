The fit, color, and material are great! I never ordered clothes before from Amazon so I wasn't sure what to expect. However this particular dress exceeded my expectations. I love it and the fit.


I'm 5'8 and 210, I got an XL and it fit perfectly. Material is thicker than expected, the zipper is tough to zip in some places but over all I am happy with the dress.


Gave it 4 stars because of the zipper


Fits percectly! I've gotten a lot of great compliments and the material is so soft!


Awesome dress for a great price


My daughter likes it very much


Great dress!


Material is great, very heavy and slightly stretchy. I'm 5'7" and the small comes just above my knee. The zipper in the back is really neat too, it blends in so well. Overall, it's a very cute dress and I can't wait to wear it!


This is exactly as pretty as I was expecting and fits beautifully, runs true to size, and as a very tall girl hits mid thighs, so it might run towards knee length on shorter women


Nice material and really cute but much much longer than I thought


Very well made, good quality fabric. The bust area was a little too large but a quick trip to a seamstress fixed this.
