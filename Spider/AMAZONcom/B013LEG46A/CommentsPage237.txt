A good fit!


I had high hopes for this dress because of the other reviews. I had this overnighted because I was worried about the length of my original Christmas Eve party dress. I am generally a size 2 and I have a lovely figure. This dress was too boxy for my taste and wasn’t as dark a red as the picture. It was far longer than the picture online. I was so dissatisfied with the fit and length that rushed out the same day to find a shawl for the original dress. No matter how soft this will be going back because I can’t see me ever wearing this. :(


very terrible material. It is not smooth at all. My skin got allergic after I wearing the dress just for one time. Also I don't know why it smells kind of weird like chemical. Not recommended.


Nice quality and it fits perfectly. Very cute dress.


The hem was uneven at the bottom so it made one side of the dress lopsided. Also this dress smelled really bad of chemicals. I had to return it.
