All of the reviews were so helpful! The dress really looks great on so many different body types. It fit comfortably and I had an easy time moving in it which was great since I wore it as part of a wedding party!


Iâ€™m 5â€™3 and 115lbs and ordered an xsmall in salmon pink. It fits a little looser than I wanted but still wearable. The color is a lot lighter in person than shown online. The material is soft and comfortable. Overall itâ€™s a good quality dress.


Love this dress! It fits true to size and really nice material. I will be ordering more in different colors ğŸ˜�


Perfect! I wasn't expecting much ordering a dress online, but it is beautiful. True to color land fit.


Sizing was accurate and dress looks exactly like the picture. Came nicely packaged as well. Very satisfied!


The dress is beautiful. The fabric was comfortable. The material was stretchy enough to flatter curves, but thick enough to hide flaws. I ordered up a size because I like a little more length. It was a great purchase.


Color and fit are perfect.  Dress lays well..


I get a lot of compliments on this dress! Very happy with it.


Very pretty good material. Zipper was broken


Nice quality. Super cute. A little long for me (I'm 5'1"). Gonna take it up some
