For great! Very slimming!


Absolutely LOVE this dress! Thick fabric and nicely made! Got so many complaints and I can't wait to have something else to wear it to.


I'm always skeptical buying clothes online so i didn't expect this to fit as well as it did and it's super comfortable, i would definitely recommend !


I love this dress! In the words of RuPaul, "I'll take one in every color!"


I think I ordered a size too big, but it still looks pretty good.


Adorable!!!


Purchased this dress for my granddaughter, she loves it. Fits her perfect.


Very nice on.  If rolled correctly, it is a great travel item.


Great quality, great fit, great price
