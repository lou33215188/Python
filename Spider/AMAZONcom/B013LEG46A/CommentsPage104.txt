My wife loves it and it looks very nice on her. Anything that makes her happy makes me happy!


Beautiful dress!  Fit my 13yr old perfectly for her semi- formal dance.  Length was perfect-just above the knees and the lace was not too sexy for a young girl who usually wear a soccer/ hoops uniform!  ğŸ‘�


Overall its a very classic and cute dress. Thing is I personally am very petite, and figured an XS would fit, but that is still way too big. If you want to buy the dress for looks go ahead, you can always fix the sizing with a few stitches, but it does seem to run a bit large


A little bit tight around the bust - however it is a very pretty dress!


Good quality for the price. Purchased XL and it fits me well (I'm 5'6 190) Great simple cocktail dress


Fit like a glove. Love this beautiful dress! So happy with the purchase. I got the purple one and it is beautiful. I'm 5'3 120lbs 34b and I ordered a small. True to size and great material. May order others in the future.


We ordered this dress in off white for graduation day this May. It arrived on time, the color and size were as described. This dress would also be perfect for any occasion.


I brought this dress for a wedding and It was worth every penny! Made of great quality, fits perfectly and very stretchy.


I bought this dress for a dinner party and it was perfect. Lightweight without appearing cheap. It was so comfortable and I got several compliments.


Price was great. Fit to size for my teen daughter. Plans to wear for special events and homecoming dance next fall. The skirt part is a very "heavy" feeling type fabric. Will not easily fly up if you wear and windy.
