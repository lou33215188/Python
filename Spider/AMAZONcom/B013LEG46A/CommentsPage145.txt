Great Dress. Modest cover and fitted to show curves.


I love how the dress fits. The material is a little heavier, but it's still very cute!


I love this dress! It's simple yet pretty. I would recommend if looking for a dress for a party. Totally worth it!


Very pretty dress, i can fit it, it is very much longer than anticipated and far to large for myself to fit


The dress is good and made of very nice heavy material. The color is as shown in the picture. Received many compliments for the dress. A very good choice for the price.


The material feels great and the dress is well made, but the waist was too big on me. May exchange for a small, but concerned about bust then being too tight. Definitely a gorgeous dress though


Purchased for graduation and am very pleased.


What an adorable dress!!!!!  Fit and fabric are great.  Loved this one.


Very comfy. Maybe runs slightly big. So if you like your dresses snug order a size down.


I think this is now my most favorite dress!
