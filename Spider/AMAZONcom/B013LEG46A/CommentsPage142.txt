I am 5'6" 138 36DD and ordered a size medium. It fits perfectly as it is a little stretchy. It's a beautiful dress & I would highly recommend.


Fit true to size and very comfortable.  Would love to have in multiple colors.


This was just what we needed. Fits perfect. nice quality


Comfy and fits true to size ordered a M because I wear a M in everything and it fit amazing! Love the price also!


Just a wee bit short!


The dress fits perfectly! Very form fitting, and stretchy. I ordered a XL. I’m 5’9, 285 lbs, and it fits me just right!


Absolutely beautiful dress! I'm 5'6", 125# and the small fit perfectly-very soft and stretchy material. Definitely purchasing in more colors


I love this dress so much. It's just a little bit shorter than I expected but that's fine. I can't wait to order in different colors!


I love how it fits and feels. Very satisfied and it came in just in time for my meeting for Police Week.


Very cute dress, and the fit was perfect due to the stretchy material.  The material is on the heavy side, so if you are purchasing this for the summer-time, you may want to reconsider.  For the winter it was great.
