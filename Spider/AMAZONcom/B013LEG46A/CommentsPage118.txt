This is a very cute dress with a flattering fit!!  Definitely worth every penny.


Purchased this dress for Tolo, and it fit perfectly. I love the style of the dress, it is neither too casual or too fancy, but a perfect balance between the two.


Absolutely in love with this dress! I may have to buy more colors. Lol, no I am not kidding. The fabric is super soft, breathes well, and fits my body amazingly.


I really liked it. It is not a light weight material, but it swings nicely while dancing. No doubt this will be staying in my closet for my (modest) LBD necessities!


Just FYI, worn by the wife of Matt Stewart.  : )


love it


Absolutely love this dress. Fits true to measurements. Got a white one awhile back and just recently got a black one too!


Bought this for a school dance, great quality. The material is thick and comfortable. I'm 5'6'' and 120 pounds, and the small fit perfectly. It ended up being just above knee length.


Beautiful dress! I'm going to buy more in different colors!!


looks great


Wear 16/18 and this dress fits perfect. The quality is great and I love the fit.
