The only reason I knew what size to buy was because I had a friend who purchased this before. The chart said I was a large but medium was way more appropriate. Because of the stretch I probably could've done a small if I didn't want to breathe. I'm 5'3 and 145 pounds if that helps


I bought this dress for a bday party. Absolutely perfect. The fabric is wonderful and it fits so well. I am so excited to wear it tonight and I will post pictures.


Very cute and comfortable. I love it.


I return the item.


Beautiful dress. Nicely made. I bought it for my daughter to wear to a Christmas party in a extra small (she is 5.1, 103 pounds). The dress fit her just right. She got a lot of compliments on the dress.


Fits true to size and quality material.


The cut of this dress is super cute and very comfortable!  The dress I got has some 'zebra striping' on the chest netting on one side... I don't think it is supposed to be that way, so I am going to exchange it.


Beautiful and the color is as it appears...


I just love it. The only even remote issue I have with it is a little bump in the back from the zipper.  But honestly, how many people are going to focus that hard on your back?


I loved the way this dressed look. I bought this dress to wear to a wedding. It was very beautiful and fitted me just right. I couldn't have been more excited about it. What I would say is that if you want the dress to poof out you should buy the petticoat.
