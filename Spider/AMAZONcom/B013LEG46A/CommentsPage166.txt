Great dress! Wore it to my birthday party last night and got tons of compliments.  Seems to be well made and was very comfortable.


It was a bit big and didn't fit how I thought it would for my body type I'm 5'9" 170 pounds the length was great but if fit weird around my waist.


Love this dress, fits perfect.


Our granddaughter loves it!!  Fits well and the color is lovely ğŸ˜Š


LOVED this dress! I purchased it in blue and it was perfect for our Benefit Bash in Blue event to support autism awareness!


Beautiful


Perfect for summer wedding! Loved the fit and it was super comfortable


Love these dresses....bought in 3 different colors. Fit is perfect and very flattering.


Just a little snug in the bust area, not too bad though.  Otherwise a perfect fit and perfect little black dress to wear for Captains night on my cruise. Machine washable.


Great buy and awesome product!
