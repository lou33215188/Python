Love this year. Wore it today to a Black & White Gala. Would buy from this vendor again.


Beautiful color but the dress is not flattering. Returned it.


It's fits great I thought it would be short but it not .right above the knees looks great!!!â�¤ï¸�ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�½


Great dress! Ordered an xl and I'm 5'2" and about 150 and the dress fit great. Material is good quality as well.


Good quality.. fit daughter perfectly (5-8 1/2, 140 lbs)


Wife ordered this dress as her second reception dress, she loved it. True to size.


Got a lot of compliments â�¤ï¸�


Fabric is surprisingly high quality. It fits really well.


Pretty good


Love it. Will probably purchase another color in the future.
