Beautiful dress, great quality.


It fits perfectly. I've enjoyed wearing it.


Great fit! I wear it to work all the time!


I am 130 lb 5"4 and have the bust 34 but my cup is DDD so a size small does fit perfectly. The only thing is my dress already came snagged.


Great quality, fit perfectly, beautiful.


Great dress, good material


I am 5'5 110 pounds. I ordered a XS and it fit perfectly. Not too short and not too long!


Love the dress, if only I were an inch or two taller. It's well-made and it even has an "invisible" zipper. The fabric is stretchy, so it's form-fitting through the waist. The wine color is beautiful. Unfortunately, I have to return it because it's too long-waisted. I was afraid that might be the case (I'm 5'1", 118 lbs and ordered a Small), but since it has a free return, I decided to give it a try. I wish they offered petite sizing. The XS won't work because it would be too tight. It's not that the dress overall is too large, it's that the waist is too long. If the waist were taken up an inch or two, the Small would have fit perfectly.


this drrss is so cute!!
