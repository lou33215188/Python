Very nice dress, the only thing I am not too pleased about is the material is heavy and more like a wet swim suit than clothing.


Thick material. Very soft and comfortable. Very pretty dress and perfect size.


I bought this for no reason at all, but it fits perfectly!! Modest but flaunted, this dress is just great in general. It looks so pretty!!


Dress was perfect for my work Christmas party.


It fits a little bigger than the normal smalls I get. Also, there is a tear above the left breast. Its a little disappointing, but the color is true and it gets the job done for the price. I probably wouldn't buy it again. If I wasn't on a time crunch to find a dress to bartender a wedding, I probably would've spent a little more and chosen differently.


This fits my 15 year old very thin daughter very well.


This dress fits perfectly and feels nice. The lace on the chest was a little more larger than I expected but I don't mind it.


Beautiful dress! Great price and great quality


This is a cute dress. It is definitely a little heavier than I thought it was going to be. But it seems to be made out of a really good material that will last.


love this! This is my little black dress that I always wear to a wedding or somewhere nice! Its a must have!:)
