The dress is beatiful. The design and weight of material help hide a bit of the pudge and muffin tops. It fits like a glove. It's perfect for a cute daytime look and easily transitions to a perfect date night dress.


Beautiful!


This is such a beautiful dress for the price! Order your normal size and it should fit perfectly. No one would ever know how affordable it is by looking at it. Very nice quality and I'm thrilled with the fit.


Love this dress. I'm 5'5 165 lbs. Got a size large. It fit perfect! Bought it for a wedding but you could dress it down as well!!!


Perfect!!! Soft and comfortable!!!


Great Ponte material that's stretches and practically wrinkle free. Good finishes and great lines. The full skirt is adorable and flirty, but super polished. Love it!
