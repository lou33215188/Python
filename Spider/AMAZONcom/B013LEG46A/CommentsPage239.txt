Runs way too big and way too long. Will be returning.


Not what the picture makes it out to be


It's not form fitting at all . The cut around the chest area did not look like the picture at all very boxy and not flattering


material was uncomfortably heavy and came with a stain on the dress! very disappointed, not worth the money and returning.


Cute product but too big. Order a size down.


The dress is a nice style but disappointed because I order the white dress and when I got it it looked like a tinted yellow. :(


I'm 6'1 so it's a little short on me.


It was a bit tight fitting. Would it be possible to exchange or return?


Very pretty.  Heavy in weight and material. Brought equivalent of a 1X(16-18). Fit like a small(8-10 maybe?). Arm holes were narrow as well. These sizes are Asian women fitting and not American size fitting. If your not super fit, no fat and flat chested, this dress is not for you. Don't let the pictures and reviews fool you.


nice dress and great quality material. Recommend. 5'7 115lbs, XS fits good.
