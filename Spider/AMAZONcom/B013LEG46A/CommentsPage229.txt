Very cute and flattering dress.  Can be super dressy or can be dressed down as well!


Color is a very pale peach not the beautiful coral as pictured.  Odd fitting. Not for me


I measured my daughter per the recommended sizing.  The dress was way too large when it arrived.  It also looks much richer in the picture than it does in person.  The material is too thin.


This was weirdly big in some dimensions (bust, neckline), but too short for someone 5'7"


Did not like the fit on my body but would look great for someone with less hips


Zipper was poor - did not hold up to a single pull while not even on - will be taking to a seamstress to replace the zipper as I really like the dress


disappointing


Beautiful dress, nice quality fabric.


It's a bit longer in length than my daughter expected ( she's 5'1" ), but looks so beautiful on her!


Super long. Small on chest area.


I love this dress!
