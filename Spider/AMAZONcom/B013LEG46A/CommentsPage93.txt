I bought this dress for my granddaughter and she loved it.


Wonderful dress! I bought the black with the sheer top and the dark red with the lacy black top and they are both beautiful! They fit great too! I'm 5'2 and about 110 lbs and it fits like a dream. I like that it is dressy but not too nice so i can wear it for date night or even just to work!


Dress was perfect!  Fit as expected, looked exactly like the picture online.  Others indicated that the lower half of the material was too thick.  I disagree.  The bottom of the dress was just right.


We ordered these to use in a play for some pre-teen girls.  The sizes were good, but be careful, the waist is a bit of a drop waist and it did't fit some of the girls correctly. Our sewing lady was able to fix them, but it was a problem for several girls who needed a shorter waist.  Nice material, very forgiving and good for the price.


Good


Elegant and comfy!


im a size 16/18 5'6 and i ordered a xlarge and it fitted in the top and loose and flowy in the bottom. falls about 3inches above the knee and good quality, very comfortable.


I loved this dress and would highly recommend it. It fit great and was very comfortable. I personally liked the lace style top better than the mesh style. I tried both and really liked the lace. I would order this in a couple extra colors as a go to dress.


This was too big for me, so I had to pin it up when I wore it. It's a little too much of a hassle to wear that often.


Beautiful dress made from quality fabric. The lace will definitely stand up to being washed. However, the waist sat funny on me and was unflattering. I gave the dress to my best friend, and it looks great on her.
