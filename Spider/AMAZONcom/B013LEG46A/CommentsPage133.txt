Shipped on time and I love the dress!  It fits accordingly to the size chart and I couldn't be happier.


I love this dress so much. I wear a size 5 in pants, so I got a small in this dress. I am 5'3" and 125 pounds. This dress fits perfectly.


The dress came in right before my 10 yr wedding anniversary. Thank goodness it was true to size!! The dress is very beautiful!! Great dress!!


Great dress for the price! It's true to size. I love the fabric, not too heavy but not shear! It's flows nicely!


Bought this dress for my 13 year old daughter, and it was too small. Otherwise the dress was cute.


According to the chart I should have been an XL but after posting my measurements others suggested I purchase a M. The medium fits my size/shape perfectly!


Great little dress! Fit was true to size, dress was as described. Ordered it for a last minute party.


Great dress good quality for as cheap as it was the only problem I had was the gapping I had in the arm area


It's a lovely dress, great quality lol.


But I should've gotten the L not the XL. I thought it would run small but it doesn't, it fits true to size.


So just make sure you get your size haha.


Great
