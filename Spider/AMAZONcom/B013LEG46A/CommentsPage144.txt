Love it! Great quality material and very comfortable!


I liked the style and overall fit of this dress, high quality material and very comfortable. Unfortunately at 5'3'' the XL was just too long and I ended up returning.


I thought it was good quality. It didn't fit me like I wanted to. I mean it fit but it was little loose. It does run a little big.


Love how this fit and made me feel bought for a bachelorette party and was perfect


Is a nice looking dress for the money


I purchased this dress for my grand daughter to wear to a family wedding. She is tall, 5"9 and curly.  I got a XL and it fit perfectly.


Very flattering once it is on. Nice material- stretchy but still holds everything snug.


Love the dress.  Fits just right.  The only thing thought it was more purple instead of a dark wine.  But it looks lovely on my daughter.


The dress is exactly how it looks on the picture!!! I love how it fits!!!


love the dress
