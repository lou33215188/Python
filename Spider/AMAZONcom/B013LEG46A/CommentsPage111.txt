Gift for my wife, she likes it.


I love the fit of the dress, very comfy and well made, it was a tad bit longer than I had expected from the model picture but I'm only 5'4" so that's to be expected, over all love and I would purchase a dress from them again!


The dress was beautiful and I loved the Material. The material is sort of stretchy, I would recommend steaming this material, the iron got too hot. The red was a bright red, which was perfect for the function that I attended. The dress was a bit short but it worked!


Great for any occasion and my fianc√© loves it.


The dress wasn't very flattering on me, but that's not a fault of the dress itself. It looks exactly as pictured and fit as I expected.


Love the way it fits. I wear a size 12 in women's and I ordered a Large. It fits perfect! Good material and great price!


I bought this dress for my sororitys formal. And oh my gosh it is absolutely beautiful! It was everything i thought it would be i tried it on and it looked fantastic. Ic you are thinking of buying it, do it!


I bought it for my daughter. She loves it.  It fits perfect and it's well made.


Fits perfectly, is stretchy material so it IS fitted but I love it!


Love this dress it's seriously perfect! Packed this in my suitcase for a trip and it wasn't even wrinkly when I took it out. I'm 5'6" 140lb ordered a Medium fit great:)
