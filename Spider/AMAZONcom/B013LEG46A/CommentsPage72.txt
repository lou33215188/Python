Beautiful dress. I received so many compliments when I wore it.


I am sometimes between a medium and large so I purchased a large to be safe. I had room but it was comfy and looked great for my bridal shower.


This dress is FABULOUS!  I've gained some weight recently due to thyroid issues and this dress hides all of the areas I was self-conscious about.  I absolutely LOVE it.  Material is heavy and feels expensive.  What a great dress for a great price!!!


I loved the fit of the dress however the yellow color didn't look good on me. I am an African-American woman of medium complexion.


fits nice


It fit a little bit bigger than expected. Not very long though.


Perfect, I purchased this dress for formal night on a cruise.


It's a performance dress for my daughter (fiddle group). It looks good on her and doesn't hinder her playing. Good LBD.


I got this dress in a medium the body fit well but my body type didn't fill the entire dress out which isn't the dresses fault in any way, I ordered this dress for homecoming and got so many compliments this is and overall beautiful dress. It is made of a breathable material which was good for the event I wore it to because a gym with 100+ students in it can be really hot.


I loved it. It's so pretty and black and shiny. The material is kind of thick. It has a zipper and the material stretches a bit.
