Amazing dress!


I loved it.  I am thinking about purchasing more indifferent colors.  The fabric was a lot nicer than I expected it to be, and it fit perfectly.


The material was more stretchy than I anticipated. I really enjoyed wearing.


So cute! I wore this for my graduation and received so many compliments on it.


Cute but kind of heavy in the front.


This dress is great. It's stretchy enough so it's not too tight and not super loose. It's really flattering. I'm 5'3" and about 115 lbs and ordered an extra small because some reviews said the skirt was longer than expected and I wanted the skirt to come to mid thigh which it does.


Really beautiful and fits my wife perfectly. She loves the material, design, and size.


I love this dress!! I don't usually shop online for clothing too much because I worry how things will fit. This dress fit perfectly! It curved in all the right places while flowing loosely at the bottom. I felt confident in it and got several compliments. Would definitely recommend.


I bought this dress for my 30th birthday party and it was Great! I'm a 34b and I bought a small. It fit Great! It looked really cute and wore well all night!!! Definitely recommend if you want a nice dress that pairs well with both a blazer and leather coat. :-)


I really like the dress, however I will say the fabric isn't very forgiving. It shows every curve and crevice. I almost wish I had bought a size up so it wasn't as form fitting
