TO BIG..


Bought this for a wedding and I am in love! It came well packaged and wasn't wrinkled. It hits me just above the knee (I'm 5'6"). I ordered an xl ( usually wear a size 14) and it fits well, but it is a little snug in the chest if you're busty.


Very cute dress. Can be dressed up or down given the occasion!


Love it! Very comfortable!


Very elegant and classy.  The dress fall to just above the knee on my daughter who has long torso and long legs. The dress is fitted then swings at the waist.


Wow! Absolutely lovely dress! I was concerned because it was so inexpensive. It is gorgeous. Very high quality!


cute dress but way too large.  Wound up returning.


Very cute. Thick, nice material. Great dress for the price. Would recommend.


I ordered this dress for my 25 yr old daughter who by the way is super tiny (she typically wears a zero in shorts/jeans). I ordered the small and it fit her perfectly. She absolutely loved it as well.  It's pretty short so I wouldn't recommend for a "big bootie" gal.


This dress is gorgeous and fits great. I was actually surprised by how great it was in person. Love it!
