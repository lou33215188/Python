Had to return as it did not look good on me. Beautiful dress though.


I loved the feel and style of this dress.  It was perfect for my all white party.  The skirt was wide enough to sway when I danced.


I would order another in a heartbeat....


Just love the fit of this dress.  Looks fabulous = may order another one in another color!


I was very skeptical about buying a dress online. Pleasantly surprised when dress arrived. It actually fits pretty good. I bought it for a wedding later this month so I haven't worn it yet.


This dress fits amazing and accents my curves. The fit is as expected


Dress was a steal for $19.99. It was so cute and seemed way more expensive than it was. Very happy with my purchase!


This dress is beautiful! It fit a little big but I didn't mind the extra room. I'm 6'0 and about 220lbs and I had room to move in the XXL. Definitely recommend.


This dress is so flattering! I am 5'1, 141 pounds, and a 38 C. I purchased a medium from reading others reviews. It's not snug, very forgiving and stretchy. It also comes right above my knee.


Wore this dress for a bridesmaids dress, fit well and was very comfortable.


Modest neckline and length but still trendy for teens.  Great for girls with curves.
