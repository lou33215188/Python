Beautiful dress, ordered it for my daughter's middle school homecoming dance. The material of the dress is a little heavy which is perfect for this cool October weather. I love it!


Great dress


Not like pictured, it fit weird and gave me a pooch I'm 5'4 125 lbs.


Really long length. I'm 5'0" and got a small. It could be a little more snug (I'm 120lbs) but is definitely a lot longer than expected, goes to top of my knee. But that just means I can wear taller heels! Still feels and looks good!


Wife loved it!


Cute dress but really poor quality. It was returned.


Lace top didn't match in color to the dress. It was almost red in color compared to the fabric


Dress was just as described, fit was  perfect, quality excellent.


Arrived without a zipper.


Way to big I ordered a size XL because I have  large hips.. well it's way to big, way to big for my chest as well I'm going to try n make alterations my self... the material is okay but not great
