Bought this for a wedding. It came in 3 days before the wedding and fit absolutely perfect! I bought a thin black belt with some bling to dress it up, not that it really needed it. It really is true to size and I couldn't be happier!


Pretty gem stone color. The dress was a little high wasted for my daughter but otherwise it fit true to size and the color matches the advertised photo


Gorgeous! It is elegant, good length, but most of all a breathable fabric. I can't wait to wear it. I'm 5'7 and 200+ lbs and it was actually slimming. I got xxl for my size


Bought this dress for a Christmas party.  It is sooooo cute and flattering.


Great fit, thick substantial fabric, which I like but may be too heavy for some. I ordered in the light green and wine. The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the color of the wine is much brighter than pictured, more of a scarlet color than a dark wine.


I really love this dress. It is super stretchy and made of thick cotton material. It is true to size and fit amazing. It hid all my bumps perfectly and looked great for my graduation. I highly recommend this dress, it is perfect to wear to a graduation, to a wedding, or a cocktail party.


Really good little dress for the price. Purchased for a scene in a movie and the actress really liked it.


Nice quality, I am 5'10, 125lbs and ordered a small, wish I had sized down. It's a beautiful dress but was very loose and baggy. It's also a little longer than it looks in these photos. It's a nice dress, just bigger than I expected.


I normally do not buy clothes from Amazon but this dress fit just right and accentuated my curves. In all the right places of course lol. Material is nice, not super thick just right to me. Got a lot of compliments on it, definitely recommend it!


Returned - however the material is good quality and the dress is adorable. Just didn't fit my body type correctly
