beautiful,  he is right on the money


I purchased this dress for a funeral. It was probably a little long for my taste for any other occasion, but perfect for a funeral. It has a great wrinkle resistant fabric and it was very comfortable.  I wore it all day. I will probably have it hemmed to wear it again. Great price as well.


Is a great dress that looks great on everyone.  I just had a baby 2 1/2 months ago, so I still have a stomach pooch. This dress hides it well while still being feminine and fun. Excellent buy!


Perfect


great dress. bought the same one in red with lace. little longer than expected but that's ok. also hard to zip on your own as the zipper goes from your bum to above your neck bone


Love this dress. Very comfortable.


The color was a lighter purple then expected


Love this dreas


My girl is really tall and this was way too short on her.


This dress is awesome! I am a short/large woman used to getting dresses that are either too small or too long but this one fits me just perfect, looks super cute too!
