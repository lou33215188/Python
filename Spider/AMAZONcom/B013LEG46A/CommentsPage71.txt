This dress fit perfectly based on the size chart. The navy color is dark and sometimes looks black in certain lighting. The quality is great and very durable.


Love this dress fits perfectly


I bought this dress for my daughter to wear under the graduation gown.  It is super cute and fit her really well.  Something that she said that she would wear again.


This dress made my wife look so beautiful at her graduation


It is so beautiful! Love it!


My daughter wore this as her homecoming dress.  After shopping for days, she liked the simple, yet elegant design of this best of all her choices.  And this was half the cost of any other dress we looked at!


Took this out of the box and tried it on and it fit! It's soft and pretty cute, I'm not a huge dress person. Perfect little black dress for Mexico though. I do have thick thighs and it's a little short for me so I gave it 4 stars.


I'm 5'1" 115 pounds and I ordered an extra small and it fit great! A little longer than I expected it to be, but then again I'm short. Great dress!


This dress was PERFECT for a wedding. Fit perfectly to size, and was extremely comfortable!


Girls, this little red dress is the cutest.  True to size.  Just the right length.  Nice quality. I purchased it for a cruise.  Very satisfied.
