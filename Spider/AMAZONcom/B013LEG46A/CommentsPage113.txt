I bought this for my friends wedding and it fit perfectly! I wasn't sure what size to get so I went up the size that I normally wear and it fit great. The navy blue also looks very nice.


Awesome


Super cute dress.  I am 5' 4" 42 DD and it fits perfectly.


I love how this dress fits and it looks good.


Daughter wore it for homecoming and it fits perfectly. She's pretty tall but it seems like it's just a little long was thinking about getting it hemmed but didn't go that route. Still worked just fine


Thus would ve a 10 if you have a straight slim bod! Not made for cury girls!


Beautiful Dress Great material


Nice dress... fabric is a little too thin for my personal preference.


I'm sort of between an 8 & 10 right now and the medium fit great, and was super cute!


I LOVE this dress! Every time I wear it I get compliments left and right. I was pretty leery purchasing a dress this online, but was very pleased on the fit and quality. I felt wonderful!!
