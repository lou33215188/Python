Beautiful. Zipper works. True to size, and really a gorgeous dress


Fits like a glove. Especially, if you have a  great figure!


This dress is perfect! It doesn't look or feel cheap, I ordered it in the black with the lace top and I got so many compliments on the quality and the over all look of this dress, absolutely gorgeous


Size ran small.  Cute dress and nice quality fabric. Very small in the bust.


Item fits well, decent fabric, holds up in the wash, and looks amazing!

Great fitting dress! I'm 5'4, 135 lbs, 34C and it fit like a glove. Highly recommend purchasing for that simple classic dress.


Love this dress! It is comfortable, well made, and stylish. I fancied it up with a ribbon "belt" and a crinoline, and also wore it plain. Looked great both ways.


I love this dress! I wore it with a navy blue cardi and navy shoes with white floral jewelry. I got this dress in purple and I love the way it twirled when I was dancing! I got so many compliments and it was perfect for my curvy figure. I am 5'4" and 150. I bought a large and it was perfect!
