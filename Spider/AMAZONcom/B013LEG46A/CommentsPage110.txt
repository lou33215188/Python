The dress was alright but the material was not quality. The dress was snagged but since it was for the homecoming, she wore it. Afterwards, I threw it away....


The dress arrived and fit perfectly, it was a nice length hitting right above the knee. I wore it to a holiday party and got a few compliments on it.


I am very pleased with this dress


Would recommend. Very cute dress! Great material. Fits true to size.


I absolutely love this dress!!! Cant wait to wear it!! :)


Amazing!!! Bought this after I bought a red one! Love them both!!!


Love this dress! Size chart is right on. I am usually a medium (5'2 160 lbs), but I ordered a large to be safe and I could have worn a medium. The large is still fine for me. The length is perfect and it is so comfortable! It can also be dressed up or down and a perfect every occasion dress!


Gorgeous dress, great quality.


Fits great, color just like pictured online, and looked great at our Mardi Gras themed family reunion!


I love this dress. It's very simple yet elegant. I'm 5'9" and 140 lbs. I ordered a size 4 and it fits perfect.
