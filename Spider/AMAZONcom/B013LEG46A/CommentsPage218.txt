Loved the dress


It was exactly what we hoped for, and quick too


Bigger than expected


Simple and clean little black dress


Love this dress! It's perfect! The fabric is nice and not cheap feeling whatsoever! For customer reference, I ordered a small and I am 5'5", 130 lbs chest size 32 C and it fit absolutely perfectly. I bought this for my college graduation, it's wonderful. Exactly what I was looking for, I love the mesh neckline.


Fitted as expected.


Love the style of the dress and the material. Unfortunately for me the dress just didn't work on my body type. I ordered both XL and XXL due to being in between sizes. I only tried on the XL, which fit, but the drop waist hits a weird spot on me. The zipper in the back doesn't sit flat and gives a weird bubble bulge. The top also look too big on me. Overall the dress is a cute style, just not for my my pear shape.


Perfect fit, I love this dress!


The dress is beautiful and comfortable


Fits perfect and looks great.
