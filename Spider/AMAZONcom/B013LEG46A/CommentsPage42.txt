I ordered an XL which, according to the size chart, should have fit.  The dress is nice and looks like the picture.


The bridesmaids loved it.


Gorgeous dress, I bought it for my daughter. Excellent fit


If i could give this dress 10 stars i would. My daughter loved this dress super cute comfortable and recieved on time and packed good


The royal blue is a gorgeous color, and the dress is well designed. However, the fabric is stretchy enough to be unflattering around the waist. Plan to wear shapewear or size up.


If you have a larger chest the colored netting will stretch causing white streaks to show between the color


A little large in the top area.  The mesh part is "gappy" and doesn't lay flat or tight fitting.  Otherwise, nice quality


Nice dress for your info. I got a medium size I'm 5'4 tall and weight 155 pounds


Very nice quality dress. Heavy stretchy material, I could have gone with a small instead of medium but it looked good even with a little room, and was comfortable. The bust was a little wide for me but this is typical of most dresses off the rack. I wore it without modifications and I think the type of material helped, it wasn't noticeable


This is a deep true black. The lace is really soft but great quality!! All lace eventually pills and stuff from washing but this seems to be a high quality lace still. This dress has such a great fit. I'm 4'11, 169lbs, large rib cage, size 12, 40D. It hits at about the knee and is made from a thicker but breathable soft fabric. I'm in love with this dress and have gotten tons of compliments!
