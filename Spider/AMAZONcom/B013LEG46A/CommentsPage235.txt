This dress is super cute. It's nice and made from really good material


The zipper is broke and I canâ€™t zip it and keep it zipped ğŸ˜•


Material seemed a little cheap.  It's a dress more for teens.


Dress wasn't the right one..


Nice fabric


The black dress gave off a funeral vibe for me


I WISH IT HAD POCKETS!!!!!! IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST PERFECT WITH POCKETS.


daughter loved it, wore it too the school dance. fit great


It looks like somebody returned it. It was ironed without protection. :(


I love this dress
