SIZE SMALL WAS A BIT TOO LONG BUT IM 5'1 SO..


I'm incredibly picky when it comes to dresses... But I absolutely love this one! I looked at the measurements and technically should have been a large - I should have listened to the comments which recommended going up one size - so I would also recommend taking a size larger than you would think. Worst case, you just return it - and there was no problem returning the product and getting my refund! Definitely a happy camper. 10/10 would recommend.


Very good material and a Perfect fit,


Took a chance and ordered this online knowing that’s risky when you can’t try it on first. Got this for a semi-formal dance for my daughter. She’s a size 8 and a medium fit perfectly!!! It’s nice enough to wear to the dance yet versatile enough she could wear it again. Great quality for the price too. Impressed.
