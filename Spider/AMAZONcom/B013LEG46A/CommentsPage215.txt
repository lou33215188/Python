Ordered this with next day shipping for me and my boyfriend's anniversary in a couple days. Took reviews in mind and ordered a medium. It ended up a size too large for me. I usually wear a medium/large and it felt like a small would have fit me the best. it was quite loose around the waist and was droopy and very unflattering. The Wine Red color is also 2 or 3 shades lighter than advertised. It's a shame because I think the dress is gorgeous and was really looking forward to wearing it. I'm gonna return it today.


I have a slightly curvey bottom frame and am 5'7". This dress was absolutely perfect and classy for the event I attended. The material on the bottom is heavy, but was okay since the outdoor temperature at the event was about 25 to 30° F; enough to push the cold away when heading to the car. Please do the dress justice by pairing with the perfect shoes.


No complaints. Just wish there were a long sleeve style.


I love this dress


Great dress that fits very well
