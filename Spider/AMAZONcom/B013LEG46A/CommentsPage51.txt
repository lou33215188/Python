LOVE IT. No complaints. It fits perfectly. It's sexy and still office appropriate.  :)


The dress was for my daughter's Middle School Graduation!  It fit her perfect and she received so many compliments!  It was absolutely beautiful!


Pretty and very nice for price. Paired with a pretty belt, it will look perfect for my date


So cute, soft and fitted. Perfect for the outdoor summer reception I'm going too. It hangs right above my knees and is so cute. Love it!


This dress is magic, and I am firmly convinced that it looks amazing on every body type.


I'm 5'7", 165lbs, with some tummy and HIPS. The dress was the perfect length to be flirty, and the perfect cut to hide what I don't like and flatter what I do. LOVE it.


This dress is very cute! It ran a little larger than I expected. Dress is a little heavy its self but would recommend. It's very cute!


Love this dress but I'm too petite for it. At 4'11" it hit at a strange place slightly below my waste and the length was too long. If you're a normal height, buy it!


This dress fits great, is very flattering, and is made of nice material. I was ready to spend a ton of money on a dress for a wedding and ended up giving this a shot first. Best decision ever!


nice dress i just didn't like the way it looked on me. quality was good.


Overall the fit was okay. I wasn't a fan of the material or how it fit personally on myself. But for others I'm sure it would be much more flattering
