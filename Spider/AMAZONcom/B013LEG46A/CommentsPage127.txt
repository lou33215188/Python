I could probably fit into a Medium, the large was a little loose. I usually wear a large too.


Love it!


Material stretchs good. I brought it have a lil extra room but I didn't really have any extra room I would but a size or two bigger depending on your shape


Awesome little black dress, just like the picture.  Gives you a great hourglass figure.  Nice thick black fabric, perfect length.  Love it!


Love Love Love the dress!!! Awesome dress!!! Quality great! But too big. ğŸ˜”I order a size Large bc I am a 36DD but this was too large. My opinion this dress runs big.


A lot thicker than I had anticipated but still beautiful


My daughter really like it


This dress fit perfectly. I usually wear between at 14/16 so I ordered an XL and it was perfect. I ordered it in green and it was the same as the picture. This dress is so comfortable, I am going to order it in different colors.


I love this dress, I ordered it and have been really excited for it to come! I am 5'3 and it come right down to my knees & i normally wear an XL shirt in women's, size 15 jeans & I am a 40 DDD bra, & I ordered an XL in this dress & it fits perfectly everywhere if that gives you an idea for size. The color I ordered is beautiful (wine red) and I am completely satisfied with my order and will more then likely order more on other colors. This dress I would not recommend wearing on a hot summer day though because the material is quite thick and the skirt area is actually a bit heavy. Would be adorible in fall with a sweater and leggings :)


L Fits good and still has some wiggle room. I'm 5'6", size 12/14 pant size, 40C bust and 173lbs, dress fits perfect. I also like the length, not short at all.
