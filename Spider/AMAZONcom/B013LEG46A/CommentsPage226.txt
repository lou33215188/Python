Huge party hit at the 30th birthday! Everyone was shocked it was from amazon! I didn't wear spanx and I was comfortable all night


This had so many good reviews and looked awesome so I was really excited to get it! I ordered a M and I didn't like the way it fit on me. It was a bit too loose and came to my knees. I was expecting it to be shorter and have more of a shape to it. I had to return it but I feel bad since it looks so cute in the pictures! :(


The neckline seemed higher than pictured, and the fabric had a chemical odor. Returned, as it wasn't quite what had hoped


Arrived late - too late for me to pack it and actually bring it on my trip. It is ok - hoping I can use it in the future.


The dress is a nice shape but is cheap. The material is scratchy and the seams are loosely sewn. The mesh is very low quality as well. I bought the dress because of all the amazing reviews and am extremely disappointed by it, but you get what you pay for and should not expect very good quality from amazon or a dress that is $29.


Iâ€™m a size 0 and ordered an xs and it did not fit, it looked like I was wearing a bed sheet; these sizes run way too big. Giving 2 stars because it is a pretty dress, just not on me.


I loved the dress but unfortunately the waist line was too high for me. It went across my rib cage instead of my waist. Very well made dress though!


In the end I had to return it.


Cute but VERY short


beautiful and fit perfectly.. the price was great


Super cute little dress.  Versatile, as it can be used for more casual events and can be dressed up for a little bit more dressy events.
