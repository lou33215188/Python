Wayyyyy too long. Definitely not for someone with nice legs. Bought a small I’m 5’5.5” 135- 140 lbs but it’s quality material


Such a beautiful dress. I was afraid it would be small, I’m 5’6 weigh 150lbs and wear a size 4/6 so I went by the sizing and ordered a small. It was a perfect fit. Will be wearing it to my graduation in May.


I loooooove this dress. Great quality too


I love this dress! I've only worn it once, but it appears to be good quality. It's very comfy. Very pretty.


I love this dress! Its comfortable, flattering on me and I'm inlove with the wine color. I am 5'3" and 120lb and i feel like this dress gave me a shape


The pictures looked cute, but the dress was too big so I had to return it.  I ordered it in a small. I'm 5'2" 125 lbs. and a 34D.


I love this dress. It was very flattering and comfortable.


My Daughter loved it and it looked great on her


My daughter chose this for prom. She wisely knew she'd be able to wear it again for other events. She is a busty petite and this fit her well.


This dress fits me perfectly!!! It has enough stretch so I can move around comfortably in it. Also it's a great length and the material is heavy but not too heavy
