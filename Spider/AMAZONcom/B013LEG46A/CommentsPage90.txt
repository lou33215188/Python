Great quality for the price. Very cute dress - the red color was perfect for my salsa performance. Note - if you are going to be dancing and spinning, you will want to wear shorts underneath.


The dress was perfect, the fit and length.  Words won't do it justice. I hope I can find more in other styles. I am currently looking for another dress, summery light, cotton, and pleats or skirt. I was totally satisfied.


Very cute dress and seems well made. Fit perfect on my daughter.


This dress is adorable.  Very nicely made and the material is heavier than one might imagine, at this price.  I was skeptical because of the pricing, but the reviews were mostly favorable, so I took the chance.  I'd happily order from this designer and this company again.  I wear a size 4 to 6 and ordered the medium based on the reviews.  It was a perfect fit.


Nice dress but too big.  X small fit like a small


Very pretty, but i didnt get the one i ordered. I ordered the one with the floral lace print and i got the one without. Its a comfortable dress, and i really like it. Just really wish i got the one i paid for. But overall its a nice dress.


The mesh area fits great and is unlike most dresses this style that can be baggy or too tight!  The dress comes around the knee, which looks modest and elegant.  Very beautiful dress in person and on... totally keeping it!


This dress is great. It looks just like the pictures and fit perfectly. It does not look cheap. Great dress for the price.


Wife love's it


So in love with this dress! Super comfortable fabric that breathes!
