This was a nice dress that arrived without any damage and fit as expected.  Unfortunatelyou, it didn't work well on my body type, but it was a nice dress.


I'm a bigger girl and this was extremely flattering on me.  My husband thought it looked amazing on me.  Plus the blue color made my red hair pop.


Great black dress for the price. Material is thick and stretchy so very flattering. Fit was great.

Perfect Fit! A little short in the back but other then that its Fine.


Beautiful dress - got the xs - very low cut on me, kept pulling it up all night.


I ordered a size up, I'm usually a medium and I got a large, and I probably could have gotten a medium with how stretchy and comfortable the material is, but the large fits comfortably as well. Not too big for ordering a size up.


Perfect A-line fit and flare!  Beautiful color and quality is amazing! Good length too. I'm 5'2", 115lbs and ordered a small.
