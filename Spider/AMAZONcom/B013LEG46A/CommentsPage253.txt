A BIT SMALL


Great quality for the money. I was very well pleased and will consider buying another in a different color.  Fit great.


Love this dress so much!!!


I love this dress! It's flattering and fits great. It looks silky but it is also very stretchy. Very happy with my purchase.


Simple, but beautiful


I like it but not expecting it to be a little long


Very cute and high quality dress, there is a lot of fabric on the bottom but still a great buy.


It is not flattering it on the tummy and I am not huge in my tummy either. It clings right there other than that it would be great


Loved this dress


Love It!!!!
