The material with this dress is so flimsy, would it be possible you send me another Heloise Dress


in XL thicker material needed for a Wedding.


Very flattering and has a little bit of stretch. The color is very rich and looks great


Cute dress. A little too youthful looking for my 57 year old body so I returned it.


It was good material and a very cute dress but tighter in the stomach area. Iâ€™m usually a size M and got a L just Incase and it still hugs the stomach area very tightly. (Shows every curve) The back is super cute and great length!


I absolutely love this dress. I wore it to a wedding and got multiple compliments. I am definitely purchasing in other colors.


I bought this dress for my graduation. I was sceptical buying a dress online since I never fit into anything like a normal person, but I was pleasantly surprised with the fit and quality! I had to get it hemmed a bit, but for the price you definitely can't beat it.


Adorable! Surprisingly flattering to my slightly fluffy figure. Very comfortable, nice length. I love it.


My daughter ordered this dress, however it was too big for her.  (She is a very, very small girl). I decided to give it a go and low and behold, it fit perfectly.  For reference, I'm 5.4 1/2, 125 and 36B; we received the x-small


I love it! The material is soft and not see through. I'm 5'3" and 120lbs, size small is perfect, hits right on my knees. I bought the black one with lace, will definitely buy more! Highly recommended!


I like this dress! I like the length. I like the fit. I like the bit of stretch it has to it. Very nice with a sweater. As a childhood cheer leader, it sort of felt like a cheer leading outfit to me alone. I think the material was similar to the uniforms I wore when cheering.
