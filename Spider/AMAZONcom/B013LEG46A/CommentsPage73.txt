It fit nicely! Fabric was way better quality than I expected for the price. I will go back to that site and order more!


Wore this for a gala event and it was perfect!  No one needed to know i got such a great deal!


Very cute dress. I was surprised by how form fitting it was but adding a belt helped for me. I ordered an XS and it's more like a 2 than a 4. I'm 5'3" and 115 lbs. Probably will be getting this in black too!


Loved the color and the fit! My husband surprised me with this and I couldn't be happier. Can't wait to wear it!


Exceptional quality especially for the price. I am 5'11" 38DD and normally wear a 12-14 and after much deliberation I ordered a large. It fits perfectly and makes my waist look small. I love it! I plan to order it in another color as well


Great dress, it's just too large for an extra small


Looked just like the picture. Very fast shipping and it was even delivered on Sunday. Fits my daughter great even though she has clothes underneath it lol. It will look great on her for my wedding.


mom like it


Quick turn around for delivery, came the same day as the concert. Very pretty and hangs nice.


My daughter loved this dress. She wore it to homecoming and she looked very classy and the fit was perfect.
