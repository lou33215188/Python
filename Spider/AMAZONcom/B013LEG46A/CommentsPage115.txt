I love this dress. I bought it for my bachelorette party and wear it everywhere now. Comfortable and holds up well in the wash, just be sure to lay it flat to dry.

Love this dress- I am 4'9, 102 lbs, and 34D bust.  Perfect fit except for hemming a little bit for my taste. I will probably get another color soon!


Fits like a gem! great for busty girls;) it can get a bit itchy over time, but nothing unbearable:) the color is absolutely gorgous aswell!


the dress is amazing. I loved everything about it


I really loved this dress! I went to the Former Baltimore Ravens player Steve Smith Sr. Retirement party wearing this dress and got so many compliments on it. I love the way it fits!


I like everything about this dress very flattering. Will be ordering another in a different color.


I LOVE this dress. It is well made and looks amazing on. Feminine, flattering, and a little (but not too) sexy.  I'm honestly tempted to buy it in more colors for the price!


Just what I  ordered!!! I just suggest a strappless bra . Then you're golden! Perfect length and strength!


Wonderful
