super super cute! I needed a black dress, and this is perfect. It's dressy enough for a somewhat formal event I have this weekend, and casual enough that if I just felt like wearing it on a random Tuesday I could, and also use as a party dress sometimes! goes with everything. so glad I got it!


I love this dress! I got it in wine and it's gorgeous. It's the perfect dress for a wedding I'm going to. It's super flattering as well as made with very good materials. It came packaged very professionally and I was very impressed.


Its really like the pic , the size right, not too short or too long, the fabric is super soft , i so would buy it again in a different color


This was purchased for my daughter for her homecoming and it looked beautiful on her.  We tied a sash around the waist for a "splash of color", but looks nice as is.  It's a dress that is appropriate for almost any occasion.  She's 5' 8" and the hemline is about 3-4" about her knee.  I wouldn't want it any shorter than that. The material is heavy, so a little wind won't cause it to fly up.  I would recommend.


This dress is so cute and so comfortable! Fits as expected in my case. I typically wear a medium in dresses, and ordered a medium and it fits perfect!


I gave this dress to my daughter as a birthday gift. It was very flattering. She loved it!!


It looked amazing on me, and i wanted to keep it. I just couldn't justify buying another dress.


I love this dress! It fits me great and the fabric is stretchy and comfortable. I'm 5'5 and 190 pounds and I ordered the XXL.


Great dress perfect for my nieces graduation


Really nice for the price! I loved the material!
