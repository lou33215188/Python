Daughters favorite dress


I just got this dress 30 minutes ago and I have already called for a refund. As soon as I pulled the dress out of the package it had dog hair on it. Then the smell hit me, all I could smell was skunk. I have to hand wash this and hopefully not ruin it. I need it for a wedding so I don't have time for a return. Amazon was kind enough to,go ahead and refund my money without returning. Other then that the dress seems like it's in great condition.


what a gorgeous little dress!
