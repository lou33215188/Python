This is a nice dress. The fabric is very heavy. It fits as expected. The skirt is very full and gives a nice shape as shown in the photos. The quality is good and it is a really pretty dress. Just know that the fabric is HEAVY.


I loved it. Wore it to a wedding, it's a bit heavy, but it's a great dress. Might buy it again in a different color. I bought a small, when sometimes I am a medium.


Perfect fit. I was worried about sizing since I’ve lost weight and I’m still figuring out my sizes. This one fits better than expected.


The top half of the dress fit perfectly but from around the waist down is tighter than expected. I just thought it would flow more from the waist. Otherwise it was great!


I loved this dress. Super cute and flirty. It is a tad short but I'm 5'8 but long as I don't bend over. Lol


Really pretty and body flattering dress. I love the color (magenta) and the lace on top.


For girls with shorter torsos, do be ready to get this adjusted and fixed. I have a verrrry small torso, from my collarbones to my hipbones, is maybe 20 inches.


My new go to for all my dress needs perfect fit and I loved how it fit me well as expected !


5’5” 150lb 36D. Medium fit PERFECT.


Beautiful dress! Well made with nice soft comfortable flowing fabric. I ordered an XS but I wish they offered XXS, but the XS still looks nice.
