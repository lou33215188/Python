Everyone loved my dress! Danced in it all night! So comfy, doesn't fall and fits as expected!


Love love love!


Its a little large nothing major. Cute though!


Nice dress, but the bust line was lower than the pic showed. Decent quality for the price.


I'm in love with this dress! It is sooo pretty and fits perfectly. Extremely flattering!


Loved it. The material is great; it's  a bit heavier so it doesn't feel fragile. The dress is beautiful


IN LOVE with this dress. Got it for a summer wedding, will probably get some more in different colors. Very comfy & stylish


It is a little big, but my husband thinks I look great in it.
