I LOVE this dress, I ordered a large and it fits true to size. I'm 5'2 160 pounds (for reference) this is my go-to dress!


Very cute. Super form fitting for my body 170lbs. 5’6


I absolutely love this dress!! It fits amazing. I plan on purchasing it in a different pattern very soon..


Beautiful dress, nice material! Just too long and wide for my petite frame. Got the extra small & it’s too long for my 5’1” body.


Like many other's who have purchased this dress, I am in love! It is a nice thick fabric that hides some lumps and bumps if ya got 'em, and drapes so nicely. Also more breathable than I thought it'd be. The XL I purchased is a tad large, which any woman who is an XL knows is a huge confidence booster...but it's not drowning me so I'll keep this size. The zipper is a little sticky but nothing a friend or significant other couldn't help you with. Having trouble deciding what my next color will be...


Really great dress, good quality for the price. I purchased for a party and was really happy with it. For sizing purposes - I ordered a small and it fit perfectly. I'm 5'4 140 lbs.


Beautiful royal blue, fit good, really comfortable


I love the dress. Fabric is really good.


Received the wrong item. Sadly I am going to have to give it away. I wasted my money.


I’m normally an XL or a XXL so I thought XL would be fine since others said it fit perfect. It was too big for me and the waist was too low for my frame. It seemed like it needed a petticoat or something to complete it. It seemed very plain when I got it. I purchased the wine and black lace dress.
