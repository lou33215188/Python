This dress looks fabulous on, the skirt is wide but the weight of the fabric makes it hang beautifully.  The mesh and fabric are a good quality, not flimsy or clingy.


I would recommendthis dress to others looking for a LBD for any occasion!


This dress is perfect!  If your hesitating on buying it don't! I'm 5'9 and 140 and I ordered a medium. I have long legs so I normally don't buy dresses offline bc the end up being way to short on me, but this one was perfect! Will be buying from y'all agian! â�¤ï¸�ğŸ’—ğŸ‘‘!


Great dress! I bought it in red for a holiday party and I really like it! Great fit, good quality material, falls nicely, and the color is really vibrant! It's also a great length - I'm 5'10 and it fell just above my knees. I'm probably going to purchase another in black!


I bought this for my daughter to wear to present her senior project. First I'll say that it's a little heavy but she loved that. It came out of the package and needed no ironing or dry cleaning. She threw it in a ball on her bed and it still had no wrinkles 3 days later when she got ready to wear it. She is 5'2" & it hit about 3" above her knee. Her body size is bust 34d, waist 30, hips 32. I bought her a medium and it fit great. I would definitely advise buying it. U can dress it up or down and it'll look great.


I normally wear a small or medium and even an extra small didn't fit. I have a small waist and this dress does not fit in the waist like the picture shows.


Amazing dress!!! I read the reviews and normally Iâ€™d wear a large, but I went with a medium and Iâ€™m glad I did. Iâ€™m 5â€™4â€�, 140 lbs, and 38 DD. Iâ€™ve a curvy/hourglass shape. The fabric is smooth and lays beautifully, heavy enough to keep away wrinkles but itâ€™s also stretchy and comfy to wear. It came to right above my knees. Itâ€™s the perfect LBD!


Needed a cocktail dress right now! Saw this. Read the reviews. Price was good. And I ordered. Perfect, I am xs and thatâ€™s what I ordered and it fit perfect. Lace on top â€” a decent heavy material on the bottom. I am ready to go with some accessories. Thank You! Thank You!


I needed an XL black dress at the last minute for a concert the next day and I took a chance with this one and I'm glad I did. When I first tried it on, I held my breath, but it fit like a glove and I was so relieved. The sweetheart neckline was very flattering for my bust and it gave the little bit of cleavage that I wanted. It needed a bit of an ironing of the skirt because it was folded up, but it has good weight and the material is amazing. So now I'm glad to have this dress as a go to whenever, definitely would buy again from this brand!


Absolutely love this dress. I have worn it to two weddings. One wedding I had to drive 4 hours to get there, 4 hours at the wedding, 4 hours back. Was comfortable in the dress all day. You can wear a regular bra cause you can move the straps to the edge and not notice. Be careful with wind it will fly up. Thankfully I always wear spandex running shorts for those possibilities.


I just got the parcel and I have found my perfect graduation dress. I wanted something traditional and basic red dress, not lacy and this is just as expected. I am 5'2" and about 127-130 lbs and wear a 34C. I was a bit apprehensive as many had suggested going for a medium for these stats but I am so happy I went and took the risk for a small. It is a perfect fit. The fabric is super smooth and comfortable and stretchy. I am loving it. Just one thing, the color is a bit on the brighter side than can be seen in the pics. But that makes this dress sexier if anything.
