Bought this for my wife to wear at a wedding. It looks amazing on her! I was shocked with the price.


I am very happy with my purchase. It is absolutely beautiful and it fits as expected. Will be perfect for formal wear while on cruise.


My daughter likes this dress and it fits perfectly on her.


I bought this dress for a wedding and it was perfect. I'm 5'7", about 130 and the Medium fit me almost perfect. It definitely wasn't too short even when I was wearing tall wedges.


Got this dress and it is very nice the sizing was a little confusing on line. It runs about a size smaller than I thought, I will keep it though as I am losing weight and it will fit over soon


Beautifully made dress. Got it in Wine and can't wait to wear it to a Fall wedding coming up! Im 5'3" 130lbs 34-26-38 and ordered a Small and it fits perfectly. The material is a thick quality material and virtually wrinkle resistant. Comes neatly folded, which is a plus! Exactly as pictured and described.


Great fabric. Will not fray or rip when washed. Fit perfectly. I wear size 4/5 small/athletic build and I purchased a size Small in this dress and it fit perfectly. Side note: you can totally wear a bra and the straps are not obviously  noticeable. I didn't have time to get a strapless bra so I wore a black strapped bra and no one even knew. It blended with the lace.


My first time purchasing clothes here on Amazon. I loved the dress and it was perfect for the wedding I went to.


This isn't a very deep red, not enough for the color to be called wine. Still, it's very pretty and fits well, so I'm keeping it.


I LOVE this dress. Just got it in the mail for my cousins wedding and it fits like a charm. I'm 5'4 and a little on the heavier side and it accentuates all parts of my body perfectly. It hits right above my knee and flares out really nicely.
