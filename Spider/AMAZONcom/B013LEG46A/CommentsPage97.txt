I love the fit of this dress. I'm about 5'6 and the length was up to my mid thigh. I wear a size 14-16, size XL fit me perfectly.


I love the fabric. It's so soft. This dress is beautiful and confortable.


Fits true to size, beautiful dress and came packaged well with no wrinkles.


Amazing product for the cost.  Fit as expected and the color bright and attractive.


Runs really large and the material is stretchy so order a size down!


I am 5'4" and about 190-200lbs with an apple shape, so my tummy is where I carry my weight. I purchased an XL and it fits wonderfully! The dress comes down to my knees and I don't feel like I will need to purchase a slip or spanxs to go underneath. The material is also wonderfully soft and very high quality.


I love this dress! It's a great quality and fits great! Will buy again in another color!!


I loved! I will definitely try to find more dresses from this brand. It is to the larger side of Medium. I think the Samll could fit well on me.


Really love this dress, its very flattering and is great for date night or any casual event.


Great dress, looks beautiful.. Would like if it was a little more form fitting, but that could have been my own sizing mistake. Definitely worth the price.
