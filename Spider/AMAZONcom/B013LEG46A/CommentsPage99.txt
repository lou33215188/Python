Everything was prefect. Color, zipper, fabric. It's thick enough to hide some flaws. It's very sexy without being trashy. It's comfortable. I'm a size 8/10. I ordered a medium.


This dress is amazing! I didn't expect it to fit as well as it does. I am 5' 3" and 130 lbs but this dress fit perfectly. It can be worn anywhere so it's the perfect black dress. Love it!


I'm 5'5, about 198 lbs... I bought an extra large and it fits perfectly. Even better than expected! It's comfortable, the material seems sturdy (doesn't look cheap). I'd recommend to everyone


This dress is EXACTLY what I was looking for and fits like a glove. It classy and timeless. This is a great buy. The price is unbeatable, and the dress looks way more expensive than it is. So glad I purchased this.


Beautiful dress!  Will buy more!


The dress is super comfortable I didn't have any problems to get in it. I just think the tail of the dress was too heavy like when I was spinning I could feel the heaviness of material but other than that I love the dress and I couldn't been more happy. Thank you.


Material is even better than expected, fit is great, and color is beautiful! Definitely recommend this dress.
