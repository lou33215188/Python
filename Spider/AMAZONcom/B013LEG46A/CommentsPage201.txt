Okay first with the good. This was not cheap looking. The material was soft, the mesh does not rip easily, the color is a true black, and over all a wonderful product. Also, the fit was as expected. I have one single complaint that knocked this product down from being a perfect 5, and that's that it is heavy! I have never worn a dress so heavy! The material is super thick, which is nice because it portrays the dress as being a lot more expensive than it truly is, but I prefer flowy dresses that don't make me feel weighed down. Other than that however it is a wonderful product


kind of thin.


Love this dress. Bought in several colors and have received many complements. True to size!


Love the dress! Looks and fits great. Sizing is accurate as well!


Great material very comfortable


The size fits well. However, the length is still a little bit too long for me


I love it and fit right.


I wore it today for formal friday and it left a purple stain on my legs/arms/hands. I'm very disappointed. The dye is clearly cheap


I love it.


Got this dress for my daughter. Very good material. Fits her good
