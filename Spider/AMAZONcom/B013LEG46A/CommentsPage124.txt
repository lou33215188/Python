very pretty dress. thick material. not cheaply made.


Great dress! I like the feel of the material. I little larger than expected but definitely wearable. I wear it as a cocktail dress, or to work with a blazer


Was perfect fit. The dress came quick and was well made and soft.


I did not like this dress. The material showed everything. It's stretchy, but I don't like materials where you can see every lump and bump from my bras back fat to my belly button.  Just not my style. I returned it


If I could leave 10 stars i would.  Gorgeous, comfortable and did I say gorgeous.  Loved it


This is a beautiful and flattering dress! I love the cut and stretchy material! I added a cinch belt and black shawl for the perfect wedding look!!


Perfect


I LOVE this dress! Very comfortable and perfect for a night out. Red color is beautiful. Worth every penny!


This dress is extremely high quality. I bought it to act as my bridesmaid dress in my friend's wedding and it is perfect.


Got the wrong size... Needs a small
