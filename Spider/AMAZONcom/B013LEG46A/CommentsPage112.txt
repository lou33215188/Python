The dress is more beautiful in real life than what it looks like on Amazon. I usually wear XS, and the XS of this fits me perfectly. It's an excellent dress for the price.


Ordered it for a wedding, the only complaint I have is the length was a tad too long, but other than that it sorked out great!

I love it i love it omg the feel the quality is amazing!


I got the dress within a few days as promised. The dress looked just like the picture and fit as expected. I was very happy with the dress and look forward to ordering other clothes from this vendor. Thanks for making my night.


I love this dress. It hugs in the right places and can be dressed up, or down.


Great Dress! I wore this to a semi formal event at my University and got quite a few compliments. The material was sturdy and the sizing was exactly as expected. I'm 5'6 and around 110 pounds so I ordered an extra small in wine red. This dress will definitely come in handy in the future.


Beautiful and good quality material


So cute! I love it, I am planning to wear it to graduation and the after party. It is nice and hits alittle above the knee. I am 5'3 and got a small. All it needs is a waist belt.


Absolutely adorable dress! I really wanted to love this one. There was a bit too much material in the armpits for me so it was puffing out.  Please note, I am extremely large chested, so I'm not sure how it will lay for a smaller chest.
