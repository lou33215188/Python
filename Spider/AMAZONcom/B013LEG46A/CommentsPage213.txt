True to size.


I was so excited to find a dress that came in an xs as a woman who is 4'11" and barely 100 lbs but was disappointed when I tried it on and it didn't fit. The waist line was down by my hips, the chest was baggy, and the zipper in the back was sorta bunched up. If you're a woman whose size is similar to mine, I wouldn't recommend this dress. Otherwise I found the material to be strong and I liked that it was stretchy. Everything about the dress was great, except for the fit.


I love it


Great dress!!


Great fit and color was just as expected.  Great price!


Heavy material, good quality for the price. Fits nicely, good for any occasion from dance to wedding.
