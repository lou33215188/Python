This dress fits perfectly! The length was about an inch above my knee so there were no issues with it riding up too much when I sat. The material is a little on the thick side, so it might not be ideal for warmer temps.

Very nice dress! Love the fit and the color! I ordered a XL and I am 5'5 230 lbs fit nicely!


I love this dress! I am 4'11" and 134lbs, so I ordered a medium. It was a little big in the waist, and a little longer than I expected, but I that problem with most clothes. Because of the fit, it is appropriate to wear almost anywhere. The fabric is nice!


This dress is perfect for any figure, very comfy and warm-definitely meant for the fall/winter months.  So easy to clean- a plus for a mom who needs a night away from her 3 crazy boys!
