Love love my new dress wearing for my 30th birthday size and fit were perfect!


This dress is so cute! After reading many reviews, I decided to go with a large instead of my first impression of getting an XL. I love the way this dress looks and fits, and I can't wait to wear it to a wedding I'm attending next month.


I'm a photographer and needed a new black dress to wear when shooting weddings. This dress is perfect! It's thick enough that it won't fly up (unless it's suuuuuper windy) and the illusion top is just fancy enough! I even got another one of these in royal blue!! Love love love this dress!


Material was thick and soft. Lace pretty. However, too long for long liking. In 5’2” 145 muscular build. I.T was To my knees. I ordered a Medium. I like them a little tighter. But it was too lose.


Wore this in my sister's beach wedding. Great quality for the price. I had been feeling self conscious because of a recent weight gain, but this A-line dress provides good coverage and creates an hourglass silhouette. The dress has a very full circle skirt, which I liked for this event. I ironed the dress on the lowest setting and it was fine. Bought a Large and it fit well. I am 5'6, have a 31 inch waist, and wear a 36D.


Super cute dress,


I am 5'6 and the dress reaches just above the knees. The mesh back and front is sexy and classy. Great price!


Perfect for the dressy casual occassion.


This dress.arrived on time and fit perfectly! Very pleased with the make and fit of the dress!


Wow - just got this dress today and it is SO much better than expected. Really nice thick material! Perfect length! So pretty!! :)


Great dress, love it
