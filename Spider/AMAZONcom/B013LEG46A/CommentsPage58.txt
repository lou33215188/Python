I am 5'2" 148 pounds and ordered a medium. I should have gotten a small because the dress is a little loose around the shoulder area and longer than I expected. Other than that it is a beautiful color


Much cuter in the picture, didn't fit me well. I'm curvy so i wouldn't recommend this for someone with curves. i returned with no problem.


Love this dress! Fits just as description states It is extremely comfortable, and the fabric is breathable! You can wear it to basically any occasion! Comes in tons of colors and styles! Highly recommend!


It was perfect for my husbands ALS graduation (military).


It fit as expected! I was a little nervous as I had read the comments but did exceptionally well as it fit. Did follow the chart but everyone size and statue is different! I ordered a 2x because I weighed at the time 212lbs. The material was as expected and neatly wrapped in a bag!


This dress is truly a steal for the low price!!!! It is flattering, good quality and looks beautiful! You will not find a better dress for only $25! I am very happy with this purchase :)


Great quality. I am 5 10 and the dress is cut perfectly and is actually long enough. Beautiful dress!


I would love it but it needs a liner as even with shapewear the dress hugs every little bump. however it's very soft and comfortable!!


Should of stuck with the large. Good quality material for the price. It's a cute dress. But too big for me.


Was hesitant ordering a dress online but the reviews were good. I ordered it and it fits perfect and looks great! I was surprised that it was even flattering in my belly area after having a few kids. Doesn't push in or anything around the waste. I love it!! And can't wait to wear it at a wedding I'm going to.
