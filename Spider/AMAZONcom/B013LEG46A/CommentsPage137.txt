Okay so first off, this dress was ridiculously cute and fit perfectly. The fabric was comfortable and stretches. I don't wear dresses often but I felt good in this dress. I got it for a wedding and tried it on one time before wearing it. While I was at the wedding, i felt something along my back - the zipper split for the top to bottom! I had only been wearing it for 3 hours and had been sitting for most of that time. We actually had to cut the top of the zipper so I could take it off! I would also like to note that I'm aware that it sounds like the dress was too tight, but I bought the dress a size up so it was not too tight. It was super disappointing because I would have loved to wear the dress again. The price of the dress was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.


This dress is adorable!  Fit as looked as described!  Very well made.


My wife loved the dress. She looks great in it.


Very elegant dress!


I received a different dress than pictured. It was also cute. I did not have the time to complain about mixup then because i ordered it too close to the event.


It's true to size I ordered a medium and it fit perfect.


This dress is beautiful! I bought it for my daughter and she wore it to a sorority event. She received many compliments on it. This dress fit her perfectly and is a good quality garment. Can't go wrong with the price either!


Medium is good for 145 lb and 5"2


Love this dress! Tried it on as soon as I could and it feels and looks GREAT!  Heloise has just become my go to for quality, affordable dresses.


I wore it to my college graduation and literally looked perfect in it
