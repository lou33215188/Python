Can't say enough about this dress. The description on Amazon says it all. Nice thick, soft, stretchy material. Very flattering cut. I ordered the black and would considering again in another color. I am 5'5 143 lbs with a pear shape and I LOVE this dress. It comes just above the knee. I ordered a small. It fits snug but in the right places. I am very pleased!


Good quality and good price! Also itâ€™s not too short! Iâ€™m 5â€™8â€� and it comes down to an appropriate length! Yay!


Really great dress. Fabric is heavy like I expected because of the comments. True to size. I love the lace on the neck. Only issue I had was that in the middle there was a weird pleat that kinda of looked like a bulge on my stomach. I love the color but still not sure about the fit because of the waist.


For reference, I am 5'7, 135 lbs, 36 B bust and I ordered the small. It fit good but was almost too small.


Very nice dress it was off white but I need white for my choir anniversary


I will repeat what many many other reviewers have said, BUY IT YOU WON'T BE SORRY!ğŸ˜�


This fits perfectly, for the price the dress it looks like it costs more. It doesn't show any lumps or bumps in those trouble areas. I'd say its fairly true to the size chart, I ordered the XXL, I'm 5"10 and around 225lbs. It comes folded so you will need to press out a few creases but it wasn't wrinkled otherwise.


Like it


This dress fit really nice. I love the material, VERY well made! Would definitely buy again in other colors. I am 5'6 and about 185-190 and bought the extra large...and it fit well. Love love love


Fit really well! It's a bit stretchy which makes it comfortable.


I'm super wary buying plus size clothes from Amazon, but this dress is great. I'm 5'11", size 16 and while I would like it to be an inch or two longer, the length isn't bad and the fit over the chest (DD) and waist are comfy. Nice material and super cute.
