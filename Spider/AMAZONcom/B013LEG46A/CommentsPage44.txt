Absolutely perfect fit and excellent  quality for the price paid. The color is stunning and just as seen in the picture. I love the mesh to the top, the effect is stunning on my brown skin. Can't wait to wear this. Great buy ğŸ˜Š


I got the dress today in the magenta color  and I love it! Great material and great stretch I didn't even have to undo the zipper to put it on. I usually wear a XL in dresses and Shirts I'm a 36DDD but I ordered the large based on reviews and I didn't want a loose fit uptop and the large fits perfectly. I'm getting more colors before it's sold out. I will update with a picture soon.


I was very pleased when this dress arrived. When I first took it out of the package, it looked a bit small.  The material is a thick, stretchy and very nice quality.  I put it on and because it's stretchy it fit nicely.  Because of the thickness, it hides the lumps and bumps lol.  I am very pleased with this dress.  I actually want to get it in the red now.


The product came in time. It is exactly the way it is described in the description. Very satisfied!


This dress looks amazing on me! It gave my narrow hips some flare and my chest look great without being revealing. I absolutely LOVE this dress!


This dress is amazing. This is my second marriage and I wanted to be classy and simple, this dress is both. The length is just above the knee with a slight flare to the bottom. Material is thicker so won't be see through. The lace does not itch at all. LOVE IT!


This dress is better than I had expected.  The fabric is slightly stretchy for an even better fit.  It's a bit heavy so I'm not sure about wearing it during the summer months, but I purchased the Navy so it's perfect for winter holiday parties.  I am 5'2", 115lbs and ordered the XS, fits perfectly.  I was hesitant about not ordering a dress through usual retailers as I've never purchased clothing from Amazon before, but I will definitely be purchasing from Heloise again when the time comes


This dress is seriously cute, and fits me like a glove. Looks very classy and the material is heavier than expected (and incredibly high quality). Very comfortable too.


Love this dress! Bought as a last ditch effort for my graduation pictures. Searched far and wide in stores and this is the only one I LOVED. The shape is incredible and very flattering. Made very well. Very impressed with initial quality. Seems like it will hold up!


Perfect after five dress.  I was surprised by the quality of the dress for the price.  Very pleased with this product.
