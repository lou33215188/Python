This was for my 14 yr old daughter. Fit perfect! She absolutely loves this dress.


I never wear dresses so I was a little worried when I bought this dress. But it was absolutely beautiful. It looked classy and made me look thinner and it fit perfectly. I am weight 235 and have DDD bust and an extra large fit perfectly. Would definitely recommend buying this dress.


This dress is perfect. Amazing quality for the price. The material is thick and sturdy, which I wouldn't have expected from the price point. I wore this as a bridesmaid dress and got SO many compliments. It's very flattering.


Love it. Thanks


sent back did not fit


It's nice but a little small and the lace looks cheap. It's not even black it's more like a gray color


This dress is beautiful and made from really good fabric, not cheap feeling at all. Lovely color too. I got navy blue.


Just surprised my teen daughter with this and she LOVES it. She's only 14, 5 feet and a 36c so finding clothes is tricky sometimes. This is flattering, cute and fun.


Great color, great fit. Very comfortable. One odd thing I noticed about it is that it stains a little easily... I always seem to find crumbs around the skirt area of it. Not sure what that means, I've never had that problem with any of my other dresses. Over all good dress though.


lovely fit and quality
