Love this dress, It can be dressed up or down and very appropriate for work with a blazer or cardigan


I love this dress . I am 5'6 170 bottom heavy. I love this dress fits perfect. Pefect length and the arm holes are not to big either.


My wife loves this. She wants multiple colors now.


I really thought the dress was going to look cheap because of the price, but it didn't.  It looked really good on and fit perfectly!


I ordered this dress in white, and I was surprised, to say the least. It was folded very nicely and fit very well. It was a tad bit see through, but a slip fixed the problem. 110% recommendâ€‹.


It fits perfectly and it is very comfortable. It's breathable and easy to move around in.


Beautiful


The quality is great! I'm 5'2 and 110 lb, XS fits me perfectly, falls just above my knees. Would definitely recommend it. I might even buy another one in a different color!


This dress was amazing. Bought it for my teen daughter and it fit perfectly.  I'm already planning to buy it in another color for her.


Simply beautiful, slip on very easy
