Great dress fit as expected.


fits my teen very nicely.


Very impressed with the quality and fit!!! Also a great price


Great dress... Simple but elegant, and very comfortable.


I loved the dress it was perfect!!!!!!


Quality as simple as that...


This dress fit perfect, worth the money!


This dress is surprisingly nice for the price! The fabric was a lot heavier than expected, but in a good way. The dress sits nicely and is flattering for all figures! Great quality for the price, I want more just like it!


It also has some stretch to the fabric which is comfortable and form fitting. I'm on the curvier side with a 36 waist and ordered an XL which had a little extra room (which I like).


Love this dress. It is absolutely as described


Perfect fit - love it
