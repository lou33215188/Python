Not what I expected I thought it was going to be tight like the picture looks but it's not ! I recommend this for churc people


Super comfortable dress!! Fits perfectly :)


Product is nice, had to return do to didn't fit my body type


I am 5' 4" and 160 lbs and ordered a large. It was to big. Also be warned that the material is VERY THICK. It felt like I was wearing a cow skin dress. I am returning and not re-ordering. The stitching was great quality though. It was just not for me.


Not like shown in picture. In the picture it looks as if it fits well. I went by what it said for the measurements. Not form fitting what so ever. Baggy very very baggy.


Bought as a Christmas present, way too small and return window has closed:/


Very ugly did not fit like picture at all.. Iâ€™m a tiny person and this dress was just bad..


Was to long. To big in the waist and bust. Was a beautiful dress I was so excited to get. Until I put it on.


Supee cute dress. But this dress is very heavy which is the main reason why I returned it.


The dress is cute and it didn't come wrinkled. The description for the size was nowhere near accurate.
