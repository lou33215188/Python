There was a small tear on the lower left side of the lace in the front. I had to bring it to a seamstress to hopefully fix. Otherwise seemed ok


I was very impressed with this dress, especially for the price.  The material is soft and doesn't feel cheap at all.  I will be looking at this in more colors.


nice but not my style and so heavy..


Perfect and very comfortable.


I love it because it is more fitted.  I will be ordering more colors of same dress


This dress looks fantastic. I was just sad the purple wasn't available. Once it is, please let me know!


I got this dress for my friends home coming and she absolutely loved it, I honestly just guessed her size and it fit perfectly.


Flattering and cute.


Super cute dress, fit as expected. Looks even more dressed up with a nice necklace.


Dress is actually a cream color not white and material is very heavy


Great fit! Great length (i'm tall and it's hard to find something that is the right length. love the dress, looks good and fits well.
