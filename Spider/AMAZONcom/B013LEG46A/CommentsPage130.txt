This dress is fabulous! Looks so elegant and is made very well. Would highly recommend this dress.


I bought this dress for my small wedding ceremony. It fit great and looked great.


I am wearing the lace wine red dress as a bridesmaid dress within the next month. When I tried this on it fit perfectly and it is very comfortable and flattering. I can't wait to wear it!


Beautiful dress,  just to short for my 5'8" frame.  Nice stretchy material,  but better for the shorter woman.


Compliments the body very well. Nice fabric and no scratchy areas.
