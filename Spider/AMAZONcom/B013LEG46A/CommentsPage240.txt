To large I hate the dress


This isn't a cocktail dress.... it's a floor length dress. Not too happy about it.


I ordered a small and am generally a size 4-6 (depending on brand) very good quality of material! Much better than I was expecting


I love this dress! I got the blue and it is definitely blue, but beautiful! I was suprised at how well made it is. Nicely made, great materials, it actually has a little weight to it! I got a small and it fit perfectly! I am 5'7, 105 lbs, 34B. I could have been a little bigger in the chest still without it being too tight but the waste and length was perfect! I am very happy with this purchase and received lots of compliments!


Very Disappoint.  Size not accruate.


I tried on and absolutely loved the dress. It is made with the bit heavier material so it's not as likely to rip. To me high quality. I intended to wear it for Easter Sunday. You will laugh at this. From the packaging there was one or two small wrinkles. No big deal, I got the iron out. My stupidity cost me the dress. As I ironed I came close to the top of the dress (where the netting was). Sure enough by slightly touching the netting with the iron, I burned a whole right thru it. I was so mad at myself. I still love the dress and for the price I will be buying another one.


The dress itself was very cute.  But my daughter said it was really heavy. I picked it up, and it really was! She wanted something lighter for homecoming so she wouldn't be sweatting all night.  Unfortunantly had to return it.


It is to heavy and small


Too big


Love this dress. It came down to my knees. I have trouble finding dresses that don't over accentuate my top. This hid the cleavage and still looked sexy on. 5'1" 190lbs, I ordered a XL and it fits great. not showing too much and doesnt look frumpy. Perfect.
