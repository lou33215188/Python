Pretty dress.


Perfect dress for my 30th birthday and sunrise engagement! I will order from here again! I’m 5,3 150lb and ordered size lg!12-14


I love this dress.  Nice weight to the fabric. It falls nicely. The only thing i would change is it is a bit too long and i may have it altered. But otherwise i love it


I LOVE THIS DRESS!  I fit perfectly to my hourglass figure and received many complements on it! I'm definitely going to buy more in a different color!


I'm wearing it now. It's a great fit and the fabric is soft and sleek. It shipped quickly and arrived neatly folded in a plastic garment bag. There are a couple minor imperfections in the sheer netting but I'm still loving it.


Very flattering and well made


I love the dress and for being petite hit me just right. The only problem is that I'm 5'3" and 125 and the small was a little big. Will be taking it to a tailor since they don't make it smaller and I like it so much.


Fit was right on per for guide. The lace part is very comfortable material,  not scratchy at all. It was perfect!


So cute and classy


I love Love Love this dress wore it to a friend’s wedding it was perfect
