I like the dress, it's a sturdy material, however it doesn't fit my shape in a flattering way. I'm particular about my hips and the dress has pleats that make the bottom half look larger than I like. At a distance it doesn't look too bad, but as you can see in some of the photos how the pleats stick out at the sides


Material is great, dress for a young girl. Fits small, would up 1 size. Returned.


Fit well and seems to be of good/decent quality, but seems to fit strangely in the chest/upper region.


Super flattering dress that fits extremely well and doesn't shrink in the wash. Hits about knee level and I'm 5'8". Top lace fits perfectly.


This is a great dress. It looks super sleek. I originally bought a large because of my measurements (and my busty chest) but it was too big, so I got one size down and it was perfect. The fabric is stretchy, so if youâ€™re debating between sizes, get one down. Great dress!


Really adorable.  I ordered a small and it fits perfect.  I'm normally a medium but losing weight.  5'71/2 157 pounds.


This dress was everything!! I work it to a cocktail party and I received so many compliments.  The material looks really "rich" and it falls just right! I would definitely recommend this dress!!


It was for my granddaughter it arrived as it was suppose too fit perfect. She loved it as well!!!!! She wants same dress in different colors now.


The dress was perfect. I got it for my mother in law...she loved it. I loved it and she got LOTS of compliments.  Will recommend.


Dress fits well. Exactly as I had hoped. True to the other reviews colors as seen in pics. Soft fabric and extra thick. Looks and feels amazing on!
