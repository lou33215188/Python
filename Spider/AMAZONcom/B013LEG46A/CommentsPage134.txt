nice fits to size and washed well


I ordered a size 2x based on my measurements and it is actually really flattering. Also the fabric does have some stretch.


I was shocked at how luxurious the material was for the price. Great dress!


Loved this dress. Elegant, comfortable and sexy.


It was a little longer than I wanted. I wore it to my friends bachelorette party and had people complementing on the dress all night. Very cute dress for a great price!!


Fit my 14 year old very well, looks great.  She is relatively tall and skinny for her age.


Cute but too short for my event. Fits snugly but still flattering.


Perfect everything dress. Real nice classy look.


5 stars


Good fit.


Lovely dress but the medium was way to large for me.
