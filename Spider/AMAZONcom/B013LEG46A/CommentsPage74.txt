The material is thicker than I thought it'd be, very cute! Thank you


The dress was a bit short but still very cute


I like it!


Bought for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. This comes from a girl who never wears dresses.


I wasn’t sure what to expect for a dress at this price point, but decided to give it a try.  It feels like a very high quality fabric and seems to be well made, and it fits my daughter perfectly. I’m very impressed!


Beautiful, light, yet quality material and make. I really like it and can't wait to wear it


Arrived on time. Fits great.


I bought this just to own a plan dress so when I saw this, I had to have one. The dress is so soft and very cute. I normally wear a medium so I got that, and it fits perfectly. It's a good, affordable price for an amazing dress. I even bought a second one in the dark red wine color.


Gorgeous dress my husband loves it!


very cute dress for the price, the material is great and I love the lace at the top!
