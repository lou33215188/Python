Fit perfectly and looks amazing


I just made sure to view the sizes and it fit me PERFECTLY. I usually where a 7/8 in pants and a medium shirt. I'm 5'6 and it's right above the knee. I  love it.


Looked great on me but a little to short in length for my height.  Great buy!


Dress looks beautiful


Great material


Not a single wrinkle


I was very disappointed that this didn't fit better because it felt super comfortable. But returning it was very easy! Unfortuantely the bust was just too big for me.


I LOVE this dress!! I wear a medium size so I ordered a medium it fits perfectly!!! Super thick material and beautiful!


This dress was not only affordable but fit true to size. I am a size large and it fits great! I would buy this again in a different color. Love love love this dress!


Didnâ€™t like they way it fit me


I absolutely love this dress! It arrived on time and was just what I expected!


Great dress. Fabric is nice and heavy.
