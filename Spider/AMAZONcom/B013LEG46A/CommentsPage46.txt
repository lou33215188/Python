I’m 5’4” and 155lbs and I bought a size Large because I’m a 36D. The dress was very pretty and comfortable but it just doesn’t fit right. Too long, and the seam that is supposed to fit at your waist went almost to my belly button. I feel like the smaller size would have made it fit better everywhere except the chest area so I just gave up. I wish it had worked out though!


Such a cute dress, thick nice material drapes nicely. Very flattering on.  My daughter is 14 and loves the vintage styles.  Hand washed and came out well.  My daughter is about 5'6" 140ish lbs fits nice across the shoulders could be tighter in the waist. Lovely little black dress, she gets tons of compliments.  Class is not dead!


Perfect for my life


Loved this dress!! Quality and fabric was great. I thought it may have been made of cheap material considering the price. However, I was totally wrong!! Wonderful dress at a wonderful price!


Beautiful dress! Fabric is very nice and has a nice weight to it. I'm 5'8" 130lbs and the small fits perfectly. Also, the shipper ships it very nicely packaged and there were no wrinkles when opened. Can't wait to wear it.


An XS fit perfectly.  I'm 5' 5", 34a, 26" waist, and 36" hip, 116 lbs.  The material is lovely and thick, and the wine color is vibrant and true to the picture.  I'm very happy with this purchase!


The dress was perfect! My daughter wore it to her high school sweethearts dance and she looked beautiful!


Cute style, but the material was not flattering and it was a size too large. I returned it.


The dress is amazing quality for the price.lt fits well and is well made. I am vey happy with the purchase


This dress is perfect. It fits extremely well and the material is thick enough that you do not need a slip but thin enough to be comfortable in the summer, and I live in Texas!
