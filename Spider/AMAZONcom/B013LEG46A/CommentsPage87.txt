This dress is really nice. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I'm a little worried about the zipper. I have not worn the dress out yet but the zipper seems flimsy while trying it on.


This was a really pretty dress, it was just too big.


Perfect! For reference im 125lb, 5'7 and 32 B


It came right above my knee and it has good facbic.


(Better then pictured)


Beautiful dress. Excellent quality.  Gorgeous design.


I was really pleasantly surprised by how cute the dress is for the price!!  It fit great loved that it had a little bit of strech to the material. The color was vibrant. It's simple classy with a little hint of sexyness I plan on wearing this to a country style wedding with cowgirl boots!


Such a cute dress and very flattering!


This is the perfect little black dress I've been looking for! Fits just as expected and is made of quality fabric. As far as quality dresses go, you get what you pay for with this one. Also, love that Heloise does free returns (for the just in case).


Comfortable dress, very flattering. I am usually a medium (5'7, 140lbs athletic, B or C-cup) and a small fit perfectly. The lace (at least on the white dress) is not quite what I expected; it looks kind of cheap, but the dress itself is well-made. And when the lace is on your body it looks nice.


Extra room in the waist and shoulders. If I was taller than 5'3 it would probably be perfect. Still wearable and feels comfortable.


I LOVE THIS DRESS. Just dressy enough.
