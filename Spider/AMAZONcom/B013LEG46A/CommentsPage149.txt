Amazing i felt like looked amazing


Beautiful lines and a perfect weight to the dress


This is a great dress...especially for the price. I got a small and I'm 5'4" 140lbs with a small waist and bust and ample bottom half. This dress fit great!


Fit as expected. However, recommend a slip or an undergarment. The material is a bit thin.


I liked the dress, it was a very cute dress, but it was too small for me so I returned it.


I just got this dress today and wow, am I in love with it! I had read all the reviews on this dress and I was definitely glad I ended up buying this dress the end. I have to agree with some other buyers that the dress is fairly heavy, I've had prom and bridesmaid's dresses that weren't as heavy. However, after putting the dress on, it felt very lightweight and not heavy at all. As for the material, it is so soft, not what I had expected from a $36 dress. I could not be more impressed with this dress and it is by far my favorite I've ever owned. I cannot wait to actually wear it on my big date with my boyfriend!


My only issue was that the dress wasn't actually delivered on time, it was supposed to be here yesterday, but actually came today. The seller is in the same town as me, so I believe that it should have been here on time. But, with how happy I am with this dress, I am easily looking past the shipping issue.


Dress is beautifully designed, fits perfect. Bought for my 15 year old daughter who picked it out for a semi formal for school.


The dress arrived immediately and looked exactly as it did in the photo.  Great fit and a great price.


Dress is adorable and decent quality. Problem is that is runs very big/long.


Didn't like how it fit
