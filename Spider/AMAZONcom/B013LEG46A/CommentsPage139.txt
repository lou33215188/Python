Super cute dress. My daughter loves it... and she hates wearing dresses!


Beautiful


Iâ€™m a size 14/16 and this dress is stretchy and comfortable! I was very happy with it, especially for the price. Washed well too :)


Love this dress! Fits true to size and is very flattering.


My daughter likes so much. it looks pretty when she wears. She will wear it for Middle School Graduation.


Love love love!


Pretty color & fits well! Will need to use steam or iron as it came wrinkled..


Fit perfectly! Cute and flattering, quality material.


Awesome dress! So excited to wear it out this weekend for belated Christmas dinner with the hubs! Can't wait to order again in every color!


I love this dress! Perfect fit especially for me with my very large boobs. I love the material is thick and stretchy. My favorite little black dress now
