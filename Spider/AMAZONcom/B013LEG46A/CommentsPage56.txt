Not the best picture but I loved this dress. Comfortable and just the length I wanted.


I bought one size larger than what i really needed, but i took a pleat just under the breast line and it fits perfect. And it adds a little more. I would recommend ordering your exact size. It will fit great. Especially on a big girl like me!


I love this dress.  In fact I plan on getting some more in different colors.  It is very comfortable and the size is right on.  I am very happy with this product and will be buying more.


Exactly as pictured.  Material is thick and stretchy.  I am 5'3, 130 pound and have a DD chest.  The small fits me perfectly.  Very classy and definitely worth the price.


Beautiful well made dress.  Material is thick enough where you don't have to wear a slip.  Great for a night out on the town.


I got my true size, which was a medium. I love this dress. I wore it to a wedding, and everyone gave me comments.


It was very good quality, but, It did not look as nice as I would have liked. I returned it.


Absolutely beautiful, great quality and fit well. I will definitely purchase again!


Liked everything in that dress. But, the back look is the piece for “touché”


I love this dress! It's beautiful but just as the other reviews say, the fabric is somewhat heavy! Very sturdy though and it's going to be perfect for our engagement photos!
