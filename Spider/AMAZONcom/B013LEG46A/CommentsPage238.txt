I would have appreciated receiving the dress that was pictured, instead I got something completely different that didn't fit even if I wanted to wear it. Was looking forward to wearing this dress for my graduation pictures tomorrow but I guess I will need to find something else to wear and will be returning this dress.


The dress fits but was not as pictured. Definitely too low cut for my granddaughter and her confirmation classes.


I love this dress it's so beautiful. It's a nice material I ordered a small and it fit perfectly, I'm 5'6 about 130 with a B32 cup size.


It was not the dress pictured. The sides were tattered and it didnâ€™t have a bodice. My daughter can not wear this to her dance. Waste of money


I had worn this dress 3 times and the zipper was always tough to get up because it was cheap. The 4th time I went to wear it the zipper had completely broken on it. This dress would have been one of my favorites if the zipper wasn't such poor quality.


Fits fine. Very heavy fabric made me feel suffocated. Wouldn't buy again.


I returned it because it was too long and somewhat larger then expected.


The Dress was suppose to be purple but the only thing  purple was the zipper. The dress was actually a cranberry color which didn't work for the event I was attending. So I'm returning the dress.


Didn't like the material and is not forgiving in the tummy area.


Just got this dress for a wedding I have to go to this Friday, I got sent the wrong dress looks nothing like the picture different color and completely different style. Very dissapointed.
