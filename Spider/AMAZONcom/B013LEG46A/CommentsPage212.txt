Very cute, fits great!


PERFECT


The lace at the top is very pretty!!


Dress is great but even the extra small is too big. Had to get it altered.


Perfect! Arrived right on time


I really like this dress. They only thing I don't like is how much material there is on the bottom half. It makes me look a bit large and poofs out more than I thought.


I'll def be wearing it though.


Came on time and looked awesome for my cousins homecoming!!


Great dress! It was comfortable and really flattering! I am 5'4 180 lbs and I ordered a Large. I didn't want it fitting super tight, and it didn't. But it also wasn't baggy. Perfect little black dress! :)


using it for a winter dance


The dress fit perfectly fine except it was a bit too long.
