This is a very cute dress and good heavy material.  I am 5'1" and 110lbs, 34D. I ordered a small and it fits perfect!


The dress is fine.. but I think it is not for me ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


My daughter picked this for homecoming and it fit very nicely. Was made with good, heavy fabric that only needed to be hung up to get the wrinkles out from shipping


Love everything about this dress. Itâ€™s gorgeous and great  Quality. Thank you
