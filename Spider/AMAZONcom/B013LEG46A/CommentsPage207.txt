I am 5f7in and the Medium fit great!  Exactly what I needed for a winner wedding!


My wife liked it


Beautiful modest dress that was a simple elegance.


Loved the dress. True to size. Value for the cost.


It's a great dress it really is. The material is thick and stretchy and the bottom is very flowy. The top is well put together. Fits perfect but there is that stretch just in case but the bottom makes sure to hide any imperfections in the tummy which is exactly what I was looking for. I purchased this for my small wedding while I got many compliments I just didn't think it was what I wanted. Not at all at the fault of the dress. Maybe if I had time to slim down but it was a fast wedding so I opted for a long one instead. Maybe in the future when I reach my goal weight I'll order this again in another color :)
