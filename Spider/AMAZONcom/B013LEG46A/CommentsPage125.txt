The dress is classy and i love it. My daughter thinks it is very nice and asked me to where it to her wedding


I loved this dress! The fabric is so soft and not see through at all. I got the light blue color and it's beautiful and bright! I'm 5'3", 120 lbs, B cup and the small fit perfectly.


Really nice dress! Perfect fit :)


Beautiful dress. I was a little concerned about how it would fit at first but it's excelent. Good material really stretchy as well.


Super chic and for a great price.

I am 4'11 130m pounds and this dress is very long this came down to my mid calf

The dress was shipped super quickly. Arrived in great condition, could wear it that day! It fits great and I can tell it's good quality material. Very happy with this purchase.


I love this dress. Especially for the price. I bought it in black for a Masquerade party. It fit perfectly and was slimming. It felt a bit tight but in a good way.
