Perfect fit...5 stars....


Soft and pretty. I wore this to a wedding. I would buy from them again.


I'm 5'1 and 114lbs. I went with a size small. Fits me perfectly. Just a little above my knees. Wish it was a bit shorter, but I'm happy with what I got.


The torso is a little long for me but overall this is a great dress, great material. I got purple, the color is as shown. I fit into a small. 5"1' ,105lbs, 32D


I love this dress the color is beautiful and it fits very nice, the material is very nice does not look cheap at all, great price bargain I would definitely order a different color.


Perfect!


Pretty dress but runs small. Ordered my normal size and ended up giving it to my niece who is probably 2 sizes smaller than I am.


Cute dress.  I love it.  Fits perfect.
