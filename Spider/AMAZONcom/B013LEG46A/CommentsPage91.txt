LOVED this dress! I'm not a girly lady. This dress made me feel amazing. Shoes also bought on amazon. Prefect for my Christmas party!


My 15 year old daughter was looking for a classy black dress for a dance and this was perfect. She dressed it up with a few rhinestones and dress shoes, but you could wear this dress casual, as well. She also wore a strapless bra since the top is shear. Nice thick material that twirls when you spin. Very nice, especially for the price.


This dress is absolutely perfect! Great quality and a great fit. I bought this dress for my 14-year old daughter for her 8th grade graduation. It allowed her to feel confident with a very classy look. She got so many compliments. Thank you


Excellent quality


I've never been more impressed with a dress ordered online. It shipped and arrived extremely quickly and fit absolutely perfect! It was thick enough that I didn't feel it was see-thru but thin enough that I wasn't too hot wearing it. 10/10 would recommend you buy this dress!


This dress was super cute and the quality was superior considering the low price. Since I was between sizes I ordered a large, but the fabric is a bit stretchy and forgiving so I could probably have gone with the medium. I will definitely be ordering again!


Fit wonderfully and was a value for the price. I would order again


I love everything about the dress but it runs larger than the measurements states I had to have it taken in but other than that I love it!


Fit well and great materials. Would buy again.


Beautiful
