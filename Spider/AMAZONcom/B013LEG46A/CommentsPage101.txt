Really like the sheer top, this dress is super cute! It is nicely fitted and fun to wear. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice dress to wear out.


Heavy, smooth material. Great for dancing! Fit beautifully. Absolutely flawless. No ironing required. My daughter looked gorgeous for homecoming. Thank you! Great service. Amazing price.

I bought this for my small backyard wedding and it's perfect. It's only getting 4 stars though because the smallest size they have is too big for me. I'm naturally tiny though so it's not a big deal. I'm about 5'4 or 5'5 and the dress ends just above my knee like I hoped.
