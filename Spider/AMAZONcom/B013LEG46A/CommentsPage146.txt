Great dress ... great quality and fits perfect


ADORABLE dress.


Great dress!!! It's exactly as it looks


Fits larger and rather baggy. Color is a little off as well.


With some alterations we made it work though.


Love this dress! It fits perfectly and is a really beautiful style. Well made, nice substantial fabric, Though price is inexpensive, this is in no way a cheap dress! Really lovely! Skirt twirls beautifully!


Super cute, fits great and comfy to wear, rolled up nicely to travel,


I was pleasantly surprised with the material weight as I was worried that it was going to be thin & cheap looking.  The dress was beautiful and very comfortable.


the fabric is forgiving and the mesh on top works well to hide imperfections in the chest area. was really impressed with the dress


Runs a little small


Perfect fit! I love it and I'm so happy I ordered it. Shipping was faster than most stores and the quality was even better than expected!
