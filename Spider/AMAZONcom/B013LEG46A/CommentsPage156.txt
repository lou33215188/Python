This dress is so comfortable! I really love the feel of the fabric and it's not too short and not too long!


My godchild loved it


Beautiful


Well made


Love this dress and the fabric , it's very comfortable, but I ordered a dress according to size chart and it was to big so I had to return it and get a smaller size .


I love this dress. The fit is perfect, the fabric feels so nice. I can't wait to strut my stuff in Vegas


I'm a size 16, 215lbs, 5'6". The XL fit perfect! People on here have left a review saying this dress is nice for the price, but that's An understatement. The dress quality is worth 5x the cost. I bought it in three colors because I love it so much.


Absolutely loved it!!


Love it!!  True to size.  I ordered a medium, I’m 5’2 130 lbs.  I wore it New Year’s Eve.


We ordered this dress for mom's 70th birthday party.
