Love it!  It was exactly what I was looking for.


Very thin material.


Wearing this dress at work for the first time today, I am getting a little tired of hearing how very cute I am.....Granted, I feel that this is always the case, but at times when I look in the mirror, I am surprised that I am not quite as cute as I feel...Today, however, in my soft, well-fitting, good quality dress, is a different story.  GREAT product, I am looking forward to purchasing in additional colors - How easy it was to get dressed this morning - just threw on this dress, a great necklace and a pair of my favorite boots - WINNER WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER!!!


Love tree dress but the hem line above waist and under bust was in a weird spot


Love this dress. I wear it to work.  Sooooo comfy! I’ve ordered it in another color.


Bought this to be a handmaid from Handmaid's Tale for Halloween. It is so comfortable!


Fits true to size and is very flattering. This dress is very comfortable! Love it!!


Love this dress. Fits as expected, good quality, worth the money
