Very happy with this dress. Love it!


fits well and I just love it........long maxi is my favorite dress to wear...


The dress fits perfect, I love the color, but the sewing job on one of my sleeves it awful. The shoulders do not match and sticking out of the shoulder was a huge ball of thread that was sewn into the shoulder of the dress very incorrectly!!


Great dress for the price, fits true to size, nice fabric. Very comfy!


Love this dress! It’s exactly as pictured. I’ve received so many compliments I’m going to get another in a different color


Great. Used for a Handmaid's Tale costume


Love this dress! The elastic in the high waist is a little annoying but fits great otherwise! The dark green is beautiful!


Love it - I want the other colors now!


I really like this dress on my wife. Bought it for her and it fits as expected. I love it. Classy and can be worn casually.


Ordered the small....fits great although I wish it were a tad bit longer. Will order maybe a medium next time!
