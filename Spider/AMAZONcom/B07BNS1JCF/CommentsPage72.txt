Soft flexible material. Great floor length dress.


Beautiful dress! It fits great! I am 5'7" and 160 and I ordered a medium!


Love this dress! The color is just as vibrant as it is in the photos and the material is super soft. I was worried it was going to be too long (most dresses usually are on me) but this one was the perfect length. Having the pockets are a major plus.


Really thin material but I just wear a light slip and I’m good to go. I ordered a large and am 5’8 and 180 pounds and it fits great. It’s so comfy.


This dress is simply yet elegant and comfortable and has pockets which I love!


I got the XXL to fit my big pregnant belly and I loved the look and feel of it. It got a lot of compliments.


Love love love this dress! I am 5'4 and have a hard time with Maxi dresses. This one is a perfect length. I plan to dress it up with heels and dress it down with sandals. Fabric is a little thin when stretched out in the chest area. But I love the fit and fabric! Extremely comfortable!


I only wish the material was a bit thicker or the neckline was a little lower because the chest area is a little sheer. I just wear with a scarf.


So excited. Love the fabric and will be buying a couple more. True to pic.


Love it so much, I got 3 other dresses. Get a lot of compliments.
