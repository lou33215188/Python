The fit is great and I love the color. Only complaint is that the material is a little thin and see through if I wear the wrong color bra.


Love it....super stretchy and soft!


I like my purchase very well, but will not order another one. I went to wear the dress to work and it had a big hole in it. It was brand new never worn and a hole in it at work. But otherwise, I got home fixed it and It's great.


I love this dress!  So comfortable and fits as expected. Looks good plain or with a scarf.


I am 5'10" and the dress was long enough. Very comfortable, will probably purchase others.


Love this dress! Fits great. Can wear during and after my pregnancy.


Bought two of these. Nice for the price and fit very well as maternity dresses and will even wear after I have the baby!


Yep.  This is a keeper!  Flattering and comfortable, even on a curvy girl.


Love the dress! The fit is perfect!


I was very, very reserved buying this dress because I thought it would be above my ankles and I like my Maxis to fall to the floor. I am 5â€™6, 142 lbs and this dress fits like a dream and is SO comfortable!!! I will be ordering every color hands down.
