I absolutely love this comfortable, perfectly fit, and pretty dress. I have a twin sister and she got the blue one and I got the green one. We are both 120lb and 5â€™3â€� and itâ€™s just perfect on us. Many compliments and would buy definitely again! You can wear it with a small heel or flat shoe.


Loved it!!!!


Love this piece. So comfy - wearing it around the house but you could def wear it out. Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€�, 149 lbs., and ordered the medium after reading the reviews. Itâ€™s perfect. Got the maroon/burgundy  because itâ€™s the hubâ€™s favorite color ğŸ˜�


He loves it too - I got the wolf ğŸ�º whistle ğŸ˜‚â�¤ï¸�


BUY THIS DRESS! It came sooner than expected! I ordered it in dark green for when I do maternity pictures. Iâ€™m 32 weeks 5â€™7â€� about 185 lbs size large is perfect. Itâ€™s super flowy so it doesnâ€™t make you hot and the material is really nice. I was hesitant to buy but so glad I did! Now Iâ€™m super excited for my pictures!


Love the fit of this dress. Iâ€™m 5â€™9 195 and this dress is very flattering (especially covering post baby pooch). After washing it did shrink up a bit, so itâ€™s a tad shorter than I would have wanted. Hits right at the ankles. But the material is super soft and could be knotted up at bottom.


This dress fit as expected and looks great on! I am 5'2" 250lbs and I purchased a XXL. It isn't too snug. It's a little long and the sleeves are a little long but I just ruched the sleeves a little and put on a slight heel and it fits perfectly. I'm going to order it in two additional colors. It is amazingly comfortable and the color is nice. I think the people who said it was too thin got the wrong size. I got the right size and you can't see my brightest yellow bra through it at all.


I was hesitant to purchase after reading some reviews about the length. Ordered a size large.  If you measurements a 38D bust size, 34 waist and 46 inches in the hips than order the dress in a size large. The dress fits me perfectly. Like the long length, will have to wear heels which is no problem. Have to decide on which color to purchase next.


Ordered the blue in a size small. Fits true to size, size chart is accurate. Beautiful bright blue color. Doesn't seem quite as full as pictured, but still super cute and comfy. I'm 5'1", so I had to take it up a bit, as it is very long. Very satisfied with this purchase, may buy one in another color...


I am a repeat buyer so I find that these dresses are very comfortable, easy to care for and looks great for the price. Some have been a little too long but not this one.


I ordered a 2XL and I am so pleased with this purchase! I had plenty of room in this dress and the length is perfect. Itâ€™s very comfortable material. The pockets are a plus! The color I ordered was wine, SO beautiful! Would definitely reorder in another color.
