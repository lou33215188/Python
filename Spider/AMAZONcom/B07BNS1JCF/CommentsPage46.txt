it looks longer in the picture. I am 64 inches tall and it is kind of short for me. Not recommended for tall people.


I really like the material of this dress. I did not order prime so it came from China and also it is not dearcase but it is exactly as pictured. It is a good purchase but I wish the fit in the arms was a bit tighter. I ordered a medium and it fit as expected.


I love this dress so much. I ordered it in the deep red for family Christmas pictures. I then repurchased in black and am IN LOVE. It is very comfortable and roomy. I am 5'3 and usually wear a size 14 I ordered and XL just to be safe and it fits perfectly. I am 5 months into my pregnancy and can already tell i am going to wear the hell out of this dress. I will be reordered again in the dark green and bright red to wear for Christmas day.


I wear this dress all the time! It looked great in photos and I'm loving the quality. It fit perfectly and is super comfortable.


A little long for me (I'm 5'3") so I had to hem. Otherwise fits perfectly and looks great with my Lularoe jackets.


Love this dress! Will be ordering more in other colors. It’s supwr comfy and fits a growing belly well!


I'm 5'6" and the small fit perfect it is the perfect length for flats. I got so many compliments.


A pretty dress, But I’m not real sure I can wear it because it fits awfully tight.  I’m a tall 3X.


I LOVE THIS DRESS. It’s soo soft and it has pockets!! Waaaay comfortable! I got a small and I’m 5 foot 6 inches and it was covering my feet so it’s long but not too long that i was tripping


Super comfy, perfect for all of my 2nd and 3rd trimesters and will be great after pregnancy as well. Love the dark green color. I bought a small - 5’4”, 117 lbs pre-preg weight and 132 lbs now.
