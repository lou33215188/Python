So I'm a classical musician, and we have to wear long, modest black everything for performances. I was looking for an easy dress to throw on for gigs, and this is exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately, I think it makes me look a little... too conservative. Like a sister wife. But since I was looking for a full length, long sleeve, higher neckline dress, that's not too surprising. Plus, it's pretty soft and stretchy, and it has pockets. So overall, win.


I absolutely love this  dress, itâ€™s so comfortable! And I get a lot of compliments, Iâ€™m short and itâ€™s not too long. You can wear it plain or dress it up a bit with a jean jacket and a cute necklace . Iâ€™m a plus size girl and I normally have to get a size 2X but I ordered a 1X and itâ€™s perfect . Itâ€™s not big and baggie and itâ€™s not tight fitting either . Itâ€™s a perfect fit. I will be ordering all the colors lol


Dress material was very comfortable.  I am 5' 7" and it definitely hits the floor.  The sizing was a bit small for me to comfortably wear, so I am returning this.
