I truly recommend this dress. It’s not too fancy but I dressed it up with jewelry for my dance and it looked very nice. The fit is perfect. I’m 5’7” and 125 lbs and ordered a small.


Very comfortable and I love the pockets!


Love love LOVE this dress!!! Every time I wear it I get so many compliments :)


love this comfortable and classy dress!  highly recommend.


So pretty but I have very wide hips and a smaller waist so it just  wasn't the best look.


Fits well, material is a little light but still a nice dress overall.


Soft material but too long must return


It's thin, and could be stitched better... Good fit though and perfect for lounging around the house!


Have received numerous compliments. Love that its super comfortable. Can be dressed up or as casual wear.
