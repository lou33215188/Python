Super cute and comfortable dress! You can dress it up with a cute necklace or wear it casual. Definitely will order in other colors.


Loved Thus Dress


absolutely love this dress. I was looking for a long sleeve, long green dress for days at different department stores. Then I finally decided to just look on Amazon. I was a little worried about what it would turn out looking like and how it would fit, but it is perfect. Love it. Ive worn it multiple times now.


love it

Cute dress. Fits as described. I bought a medium even tho I wear large. Itâ€™s fits great.


The length and color were great as was the material. However, the empire cut is strange and the band is itchy and irritating to the skin. Disappointed because I was looking for a dress in that length. Will be sending it back.


I would like it better if there was not a waistline. Other than that, super soft and the color was as advertised.
