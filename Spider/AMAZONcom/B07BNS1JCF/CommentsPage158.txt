Fits ok, a bit long but a pair of heels will fix that. Material a bit thin, but comfortable. Over all, I am happy with the item.


Love the dress. I'm normally a medium but ordered a large to have a flowy, loose fitting dress and it fits like a medium - still lovely though!


The fit was great, but the dress was too sheer for my preference.


Love this dress! It is super comfortable and versatile. Iâ€™m 5â€™6â€� around 130 lbs and ordered the medium size. Fit was perfect.


I love this dress! I got the olive green and it's very pretty. You can't beat pockets! I plan on buying more colors. It fits perfectly! ğŸ’“


I ordered a 2x.  I absolutely love this dress!!! I love the fit style and material!


Comfy!


Soft and comfortable. Iâ€™m 5â€™8â€� and it was long enough.


I love it!!! Wearing it during my pregnancy!!!


Received a lot of compliments.  Canâ€™t beat the price!
