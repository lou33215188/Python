Loved this dress! Is so comfy and the fabric is like shirt but still nice. I am 5'6" and 145 lb and fitted very good in medium. I loved that it has pockets!


This dress is so soft and comfortable.  It is great for hiding that little bit of belly pudge!


Totally see through and not good quality


Got lots of compliments on this dress! Very comfy...just wish it was a little longer!


The coloring is uneven on this dress.  It is so long that at 5 ft. 3 in. I would have had to cut  off at least 10 inches at the bottom and 3-4 inches at the sleeve. I checked the size chart but I think the stretchiness of the fabric made it too large.


This was an unexpectedly pleasant find- the dress is soft & stretchy and is so comfortable on. The pockets come in handy


Perfect fit looks great. Some loose sticking though


Love love love!!! Want one in every color, please and thank you.


AMAZING!  Great quality, size was perfect.  SImple and beautiful!


This is a really pretty dress. I am actually impressed with it. I have it in the wine red color in a small. A bit tight around the ribs but manageable.
