The length is perfect for my 5’9” height w heels. The fabric is a bit thin, but it’s a great value.


Item fits true to size.  Ordered the same size I do in all maxi dresses and it fits perfect.  Length is plenty long and I get so many compliments.  Couldn’t be happier.


Love the material


Really liked it but returned bc the color wasn't the blue I needed.


Love this dress!! I was 3M postpartum so I wanted something comfortable and not tight. Perfect fit.


Fits as expected


Fits great! Fabric is light/thin, pockets are reasonably sized, and it just touches the floor on me (I am 5'7" and bought a size small).


I love my dress and the ladies at my Church love it too.


So soft and comfortable. The issues is the fabric is see through and wearing clothing underneath defeats the purpose of it being so light and comfy


I LOVE THIS DRESS SO MUCH.


I will DEFINITELY be purchasing more. It’s so comfortable and elegant looking.
