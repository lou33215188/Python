The dress is smaller than I expected but also much longer.  No length was given in the description.


A little snug the sleeves were a bit to short, but over all a very pretty dress.


Runs one size small


loved everything about the dress, so glad i ordered 3!!!!


I wasn’t expecting it to fit so fab. I should’ve gotten every color.


I like the length and fit


The length and fit were perfect!


Fits perfectly and I love the pockets


quality was not what I expected from the picture


Fabric is a little see-through, but its cute and comfortable.
