I love this dress! I want it in at least 3 more colors now! The chest is very fitted for bigger busted girls like myself, but I wore a scarf with it and was super comfortable. The pockets are nice, the fabric is soft, the dark green color is pretty.


These dresses are beautiful! I get compliments all the time. My husband liked it so much in black... I ordered the dark red too. :) Iâ€™ve ordered dress from other companies that were similar. So far this is the best quality and most flattering. I ordered a size up (large) because I did not want it to tight around my hips or chest. Fit is perfect. Cute, modest and still stylish.


I bought this as an early maternity dress and it is super flattering. Love the pockets!ğŸ˜�


I am 5â€™5â€� 143lbs and ordered a medium. Fit very well.


This is a really cute dress. I love the olive green color and the fabric is super soft. And POCKETS!


love this dress. Bought it a size bigger than what I would normally. I'm 5'6" and about 165 I bought a xxl


Got this for a costume and it was a great deal! Would recommend for regular wear as well. The red is a perfect apple red.


Modest and cute! Dress fits perfectly not too tight and not too loose! It can easily be dressed up/down.


I am 5 1'1/2 and 137lbs. The material is soft.  I can dress this up or down.  It down to my ankles but doesn't drag on the floor. The length is great. I  would recommend this dress.


Love this dress! I have it on with ankle boots and a jean jacket. Nice quality, not too thin or see through. It is a little too long (I am 5'6") but with the right shoes, it works!


It fit just right and I love the feel of the fabric on my skin. Nice and light, so it will be perfect for the warmer weather. I'm 5'4 so I can wear a heel and it still be long, just the way I like my dresses. I ordered two colors and think I will order a few more.
