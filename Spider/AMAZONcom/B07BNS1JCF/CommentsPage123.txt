5’7 180 pounds and it fits beautiful. I bought 2 other colors. Super soft and well made


was big


Waaaay too short


Fit was as expected. Arrived on time and in great condition. Super comfortable too.


Very flattering:)


It's really long, but I'm only 5'1" so everything is too long on me. But its very comfortable.


I absolutely love it.  Im 5'9" and the length of a L was perfect.  Very comfortable dress.


Very shoddy material. The cut was nice, but you could see right through the material.


These dresses run a bit short in my opinion, fell above my ankles and I’m only 5’7.


Loved everything about it. Looked great with my jean  jacket and flats. Would buy again in a different color.
