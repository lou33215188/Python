Just like the picture. Little se through in the chest. But long and flowing


Very comfortable and have received compliments when worn.  Very happy with purchase.


I love this dress! I am 5’8” 250 pounds and I ordered XXL I think that’s the largest size you can get, it is a very slimming dress!


I wore this dress to a funeral and everyone loved it. It is also very comfortable


Love this dress.  It runs just a little small, and it was bit longer then what I thought, but definitely worth it! So comfy and it looks great for work or social.


Comfy, adorable, and has pockets that can actually hold stuff. I’ll be getting another one!


I get so many compliments on this dress I’m going to have to get all the colors


I sing somewhat frequently in concerts in my area, and I needed some concert black attire that was long-sleeved, floor-length, comfortable, and well-priced. This is just that, and more! It's incredibly soft material, it's comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and it could even be dressed up or down as need be. Plus, it even has pockets. I highly recommend it.
