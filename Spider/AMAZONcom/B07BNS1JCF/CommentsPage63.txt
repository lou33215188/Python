Love this dress! It is long and light. The pockets could be bigger but I love that it has them at all!!


After reading reviews i purchased an XL. I am 5'5  175lbs and the XL fit perfect. I wanted it to look slinkyish not fitted and thats exactly how the xl worked for me!


Id definitley recommend this dress the quality is perfect!


Super comfortable


Fabric is stretchy and soft. Today I'm wearing it with tights and tall boots (winter) but I expect it will also go well with sandals or flats when it warms up, and I plan to wear it when I travel in March. Definitely planning to buy one more.


Soft. Perfect fit.


My favorite dress!


Super comfy and I love it.I'm going to get more in more colors.


long in arms and length. Good quality.


Two sizes too small and no pockets...


Love it...good quality!! I bought a Medium..that's my normal size.  I'm 5' 6" and 146 pounds.


Cute. Not see through. Soft!


If you are over 5â€™6 it will likely be too short.


The elastic needs to be flatter or less harsh
