Love this dress so much!! Super comfy and stretchy:) perfect for a dressy date!


I loved that it fits true to size, the material feels nice. The color was not exact to what's online.


I love the fit and style of this dress.  I have worn it a couple of times and received compliments.  It fits as expected.


Came with a whole in the sleeve.  :(


Buyer beware!  The dress I received has an empire waistline (right under the breasts) - rather than at the waist as shown in the photo at the top of the hips.  My apologies to ladies who like empire waistlines, but they make women look like they have a baby bump.  Reminds me of the time my husband and I were watching the film, Emma (which was set during the Regency period), and he asked, "Why do all the women look pregnant?"


If the waistline had been as shown in the photo, I definitely would have kept this dress.  It was surprisingly well-made, the material was (almost) opaque, and it was the length I wanted - to the floor.  (I'm 5'8")


Disappointing.


It complimented my skin tone, my body and my bump. Perfect for my maternity shoot and definitely wearing it to my baby shower


Perfect to dress up or down, super comfortable, and it has pockets.


a little long but knew that from the other reviews. Love how it fits. will be ordering in another color as well.


cute, simple dress!


Gorgeous  color.  Fits wonderfully. I ordered an xl and I an 5'7 and it covers my feet. It's  perfect.
