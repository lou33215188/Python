Nice material; well constructed.


I absolutely love my dress!  The material was not of great quality but the fit of the dress was nice.


This item runs a little small, but this real issue is the quality. It is thin and there was a hole in one of the pockets. Very disappointed


Am 5'10" - way too short


Although this dress fit as expected it is very long, I am taking it to a seamstress who can shorten it for me. Otherwise, I love the dress, the color is gorgeous!


Love the soft feel of the fabric. The upper part is a little smaller than other items of the same. I would suggest a size up if you're not your perfect size.


Great fit and decent quality. Could be a little bit thicker material, but for the price it’s great.


I have this dress in black and I love it! However, I thought this was supposed to be more of a royal blue, but it’s actually a paler blue/purple. Just not the color I wanted.


Love the look and the material!!


John's Wife: Love it! Modest and beautiful!!! Versatile!!
