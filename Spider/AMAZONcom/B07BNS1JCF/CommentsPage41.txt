Great dress - easily casual or more dressy depending on how you accessorize. Waist was an empire on my frame, so a belt helps me avoid looking preggers.


I love the thickness of the fabric. It’s not too thick and not too thin which makes the long sleeves perfect for this fickle weather. I love the length because I’m 5’7” and hate short clothes. The only thing I hate is the other colors were sold out. I want more of this item.


I got the large and it fits perfectly. It super soft and not see through. It's delicate wash only but I've already washed it twice on that cycl and laid it flat to dry with no issues. I have one in red, too. Tons of compliments!


LOVE this dress! I got it for a winter wedding that I paired with a blanket scarf, but I still wear it all the time! You can dress it up or down which is great! Fit perfect.


I usually wear a 2x but this was too tight on my arms and chest. If your chest is smaller than a DDD you should be fine. I sent mine back.


This dress is comfortable, and pretty. The dark green is exactly the color I wanted. I’m 5’5” and a medium fit perfectly. It has pockets too! I will be buying this dress in a different color!


I LOVE this dress! The empire waistline is very flattering, love the pockets, material is soft and comfortable. Great buy for the price point.


This is my second color in this style and I love it! This one is thinner than the other and shorter. Strange! Still, I love it a lot and wear it all the time!


I absolutely love this dress. It looks so beautiful and it isn't too long, I am only 5'2 so I usually have bad luck finding maxi dresses that fit.


It's a cute simple dress. I like the fact that it has pockets. I usually wear it around the house to lounge around in because its pretty comfortable.
