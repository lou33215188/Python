Decent quality for the price. However not for tall girls. I am nearly 6ft 155 lbs. Ordered a medium knowing it likely wouldn't fit. Top fit well, arms were long enough but hung about 4 inches from the floor. Just not a flattering cut for my body type. Blue color is great, sad to have to return it.


The arms were snug whereas the dress was baggy. Nice color. I was also concerned that it did not have a tag on it. I know customers return products but when I donâ€™t have a tag on my clothes it makes me feel like the product has been worn and returned.


Was a little worried ordering this product due to the cheap price and I normally don't order clothes online. I was in a hurry to buy a dress so I ordered this dress. I absolutely love it!! I'm 5'10 and it goes about to my ankles which is expected for my height.


cute dress....Its ok. It is not very complimentary if your bust area is large...but if you pair it with a denim jacket its better


Love Love Love this dress. I get a lot of compliments on this dress. And it's hard to find a maxi dress with sleeves. Have to order two size up


Love it! The length, the fit. Arms are form-fitting without being tight. And *surprise!* it has Pockets! The fact that I can keep my chapstick on me sent me over the moon lol


I NEVER order clothes Amazon nor do I write many reviews but I had to! This dress is SOOO good especially for the money. I figured I would take a chance based on the other reviews and so glad I did. Fits great and soo comfy I am definitely ordering another color!


I love the style and color, but as a vertically challenged gal, this is not the dress for me without some serious alterations.


I love this dress. It fits as expected and falls correctly on the body. It's very nice and flowy. The material is nice as well.


I want to buy this dress in every color! It is very comfortable and could be dressed up or dressed down. It is also very flattering and I love the color choices.
