long an pretty but is you have a bust... its kinda see thew


Very pretty. It did shrink a little in the wash but hopefully that will be all it does.


It was a bit tight


Runs large.


Super comfy!! I’m 5’10 and normally wear a size L or 12. The size large was a great fit!!


I ordered it a size bigger than I thought I needed and I am glad I did or it wouldn’t have fit. Other than that I really like it. Super comfortable.


I get so many compliments with this dress. It is really comfortable and the pockets make every dress better.


Pretty dress! Expected quality for the price. Great length on a 5'10" frame. The elastic is a bit uncomfortable but ignorable for the price. Received many compliments!


Great color, soft and flowy


The only slight con is that the dress is somewhat see-through in bright sunlight, but I wear a black bodysuit underneath it and the problem is easily remedied. I love that it has pockets.
