I hadn't realized how thin and stretchy the fabric was going to be. But considering most of my clothing is made of the same type of fabric it's perfect. I ordered based on my bust size so the skirt is a bit loose but it's so comfortable. I ordered based on my biggest measurement and it's perfect.


Love this dress! The emerald green color is amazing


Purchased my first dress as part of a Halloween costume & quickly fell in love. Material is soft, dress is well made & I LOVE that it has pockets! I am slowly collecting them in all the colors I enjoy best.


Love the color and feel of this dress.  It's very flattering.  I struggle finding maxi dresses that truly hit the floor, because I like mine nice and long.  I am 5'4", ordered a large and can wear this with flats or wedges and it works either way.  Only giving 4 stars because it is straight down and at the hem there isn't extra flare so it's not quite as flattering.  Would love it if it flared a little at the bottom to give extra stretch when walking.


Fits perfectly. Can’t wait to wear it with my cowboy boots.


Nice soft jersey dress for a good price. Pleasantly surprised!


Very comfortable. Was able to wear this when nine months pregnant (it will shorten the length, but at 5'4" it wasn't a problem for me,) and postpartum. Love the pockets and fit.


Beautiful. It’s a clingy fabric, so it’s a little unattractive if you have rolls, but you can wear shape wear under it and look great. A little thin, so a slip is recommended. Loved the pockets.


This dress is the definition of comfort! It is soft and very long and has pockets! I bought this to wear on Thanksgiving because I wanted to wear a dress but also wanted to be comfortable after I ate way more than I should This dress was perfect. I paired it with a leopard print scarf and some booties and felt great all day.


Love this dress. Perfect fit and length!
