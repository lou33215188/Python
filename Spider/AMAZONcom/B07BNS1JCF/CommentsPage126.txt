Love it


Liked it but it’s very short. I’m 5’7 and it didn’t even come to my ankles and the sleeves are also short.


Runs small & very sheer


Love it!


Very comfortable and good material.


The color is beautiful and well made


I honestly bought this dress to wear as my Mother Nature Halloween costume, but the dress is so nice I’m sure I will wear it more. It’s super comfortable, flattering, and even has roomy pockets.


So cute with a scarf and booties!  Love this dress!


Love this dress. Flattering.


Very flattering fit.
