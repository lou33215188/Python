I'm 5-8 and it comes just above my ankles I was hoping for it to come all the way down. But the sleeves go all the way to my wrists and it's very comfortable you definitely need a slip under it but looks great and work good for work


Beautiful dress. I am 5'8" and it hit right at the floor. Good arm width and pockets are a cute added touch! I got TONS of compliments on it when I wore it. I paired it with a vest and scarf and it was very cute and comfortable!


I ordered this dress because it looked so comfortable and because of the high neckline.  I received it today and immediately saw that the neckline was a deep scoop and not crewneck as shown in the product images.  The elastic waistband is also really tight to the point of pain.  The sleeves fit nicely and the skirt was not as long as I thought it would considering I'm only 5'1" and these things usually drag for miles.  If it hadn't been for the uncomfortable waistband, I probably would have kept it, and worn it with a wide belt.  As it is, I have to return it.


Exactly what I needed and expected! Ordered this to wear to my baby shower. It definitely works as a maternity dress you can wear later! I wore it with flat sandals and it didnâ€™t drag the ground. Iâ€™m 5â€�4, 155 lbs. This deep forest green is really beautiful and deeply pigmented. The material isnâ€™t sheer to me. However, I did need to wear a strapless bra due to the wider neckline. Itâ€™s very soft and comfortable. The pockets are a plus!


I am 5.8 and 130 lbs.  It fits well since it stretches.  I probably could have ordered a medium but didn't want it to be too baggy and long.  I will keep and wear it often this winter.


Knockout purchase! I'm 5' 10" and the length on this is just right. Loved it so much I'm coming back now to buy some more colors. The empire waist is so flattering. I love it because it's modest but not blah and it's so easy to throw on and look pulled together.


Very nice dress. Comfortable. Just a little to long maybe 2 inches and I'm 5'5. I would recommend to friends.


This dress is gorgeous! I wish I had every color. Great price for such an amazing dress. Will be great for all seasons or occasions depending on how you dress it up!


Pockets are uneven and there is poor stitching in areas but overall I love these dresses.  I have 5 of them in different colors.


Bought this for a Handmaidâ€™s Tale costume and ended up using it as my everyday night gown. This is ridiculously comfortable. After several months of daily use it has pilled a little here and there. K will be buying this again.
