I bought a medium. Im 5'7 and normally wear between sizes 10-12, I am also small chested. It fits perfectly, the length is just right. I always get compliments when i wear it. Buying more of this style!


Soft,  fit great. Dont like how it attracts hair though.


Fabric is wonderful. I put in dryer 5 minutes with dryer sheet to ease wrinkles.  I wear size 2; ordered the small.  Perfect fit!  Good quality.  I bought the brown and the black ones.


My go-to dress. I love it. So comfortable and looks amazing.
