So comfortable and I always get complements on it! LOVE it!


It fit larger than my size.It was the length that was really really to long.Just threw it out.Not worth returning.


Very elegant. I bought it for a choir concert and it worked great.


I love this dress and got a lot of compliments on it when I wore it around Christmas time. My only complaint was it wasn’t as stretchy of a material as I’d hoped. I should’ve sized up (mainly for my bust size) and it would’ve fit better.


I love these dresses. I always wear size medium, they run small so I had to return them and ordered the large size. They need to be shortened, but other than that they feel wonderful on. They are my bluejeans, I wear them every day. After ordering three, then returning them, I ended up ordering every color they have. I love that they have pockets so I can carry my cell phone.


I definitely love the fit the color and every thing possible about the stress I will be purchasing more and different colors!!!


This is so comfortable and cute.  Definately getting more sizes.


This is a fun long dress that can be dressed up or down. It looks better steamed rather than ironed. It’s a wear everywhere dress, and so comfy. You can’t find this anywhere else. It launders easily


Nice quality, pockets sort of make it look bulkier at the hips


Loved the feel of the material and it hangs perfectly...awesome color
