Great dress! Im 5'9" and the dress justs dusts the floor. Fits great, Soft flowing fabric but fabric a bit thin, so solid color undergarments probably a good idea. Very comfortable!


I’m 5’7 and it’s a little long with flats. But still cute and very comfy!


Love this dress. The material is so soft. I received lots of complements.


Love everything about this dress! So comfortable and flattering! The length is perfect!  I’m usually worried about dresses only reaching my ankles, floor length is a must and this beauty does not disappoint! I am currently pregnant too, early on but still. Plenty of room to grow comfortably! I am 5’3.5” and 125lbs. Bought my dress in a size small!


His is my go to dress fits as expected. I also have it in green. Love how it fits.


Suppppper cute dress and definitely an awesome buy for someone who's on the taller side. I'm 5'8" and this falls just above the ground for me.


I WAS DISAPPOINTED IT WAS VERY THIN T-SHIRT MATERIAL AND SIZES VERY SMALL AND SHABBY LOOKNG !


Was a bit smaller than expected, however, it is great color and soft material.


Love this dress! Great quality, good fit, and pockets!!!


The color of the dress is beautiful and it fits me well. The fabric is fairly thin, but that's to be expected of a dress this price. Over all, I am happy with the product I received, especially for the price.
