Great  fit, great dress.


A bit see-through but fine with a tank underneath


I love this dress so much that i want to buy more in different colors! It fits great and is flattering, nice and long and i love the sleeves and pockets!


Pleasantly surprised! Perfect fit and I'm almost 5' 10" and the dress still touched the top of my feet. Can't wait to wear it for family pictures!


The size and quality are good for the price. But i don’t care for the more empire waist fit.


This dress fits well and is beautiful on. I'm so pleased I am going to order a few more in different colors.


Color is great, fit is amazing, super comfortable! Easy to accessorize


Material is thin, stretchy, upper bodice clings to body.  Wouldn't buy this as an all occasion dress.  Needed it to be in a show.  If you have the perfect sleek body, go for it!


Perfect fit! I’m 5’8” and 175lbs, and it’s not thin enough that it’s see through. Length is perfect too!


Fits beautifuly, great quality. Bought a size XXL, I wear a 20/22.
