material is very forgiving and it really compliments my curves.


5-7 and 140lbs - medium fits perfectly. Love the pockets but could make your hips look a little larger than normal (if that’s a concern for you).


Great fit but too long even with high heels on.


I am 5' 7" It hits the bottom of my ankle.  It it super comfy, wear it often! Color is great.


I was hoping it would be longer. I'm 5'8 and it came to my ankles. It's cute and thick fabric.


Just like photo


Nice and long, super soft. The pockets are a little obvious. Overall I love the dress.


I bought an XXL for shrinkage after washing, and length because I am 5’8” average & weight. Perfect, exactly what I expected!


The dress was much shorter than pictured, even after ordering up a size. The waist was also very high.


This dress is adorable on. It is a little small in the bust area.
