Not one for wearing dresses, but my wife seems to like it.


5’7, 170 pounds got the large and it fit perfect. I love how it flows and wasn’t too much. Great date/party dress. Plus it has pockets which is awesome


I love it !!


I’m really looking forward to wearing this dress. The fabric is great and it is very comfortable. I’m thinking of ordering another color. I love the pockets!


This dress and the qauilty is amazing! I love the length and how comfortable it is! The best part is has pockets! I’m 5’3 and purchased a medium and it fits perfect

LOVE THIS DRESS!!! Best purchase on amazon!!!!


The size chart is wonderful. I do wish they would have given the sizes of the model. The dress fits like it was custom made for me, my only complaint is I wish it was 1/4 inch longer


Love this dress.....well made.  I am 5'10 and the length is perfect with a pair of heels.


Dress was super soft and comfy!! Definetly worth it! Got tons of compliments
