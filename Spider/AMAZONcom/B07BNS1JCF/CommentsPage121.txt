Love this dress! Recommended it to many friends who bought and love it as well!


I'm about 5'1 around 160 pds. Brought a medium. And I love it. Its comfortable.


Extremely comfortable and fits great around the body but the bust is a little tight.


So comfortable. Fit as expected. A little long for me but expected based on measurements


My absolute favorite item in my closet. I have three of these dresses and get compliments EVERYTIME I wear it.


Fit right but print is unattractive.


Absolutely love it. Love the material. It's so soft. Very flattering.


Love the dress. Fits as expected. Will definitely recommend it.


This dress fit is super flattering and it has pockets. Iâ€™d love it in every color!


Love it!!..
