I absolutely love this dress! It's long enough that I can wear it with 4" heels (I'm 5'7"). It's comfortable, fitted on the top and flowy on the bottom!


I could pretty much live in this dress.  It fits nicely, the material is soft, and IT HAS POCKETS! the material is a little thin, but that's fine because I can wear it in warmer weather too.


True to size, very nice, flowy knit.  This will be perfect for travel as it seems quite wrinkle-resistant.  It washes well and dries quickly.


Fits perfectly & the material is so soft & comfortable. I will be purchasing more of these dresses in other colors.


Great dress!  I'm 5'4 135 and got a small and it fit great!  Flattering and comfortable!  Great dress for the price!


Beautiful dress, SO flattering! I bought it in several colors and get compliments every time I wear them!


Love this dress. Fits good, looks good, always get compliments when I wear it. Easy to dress up or accesorize with a belt, scarf, vest, or jewelry to add variety!


Even on a big lady it looked good mad me feel good and it can be dressed up, worn with boots or just casual.


love this dress...super comfortable and it has pockets!!!!! washes easily...i would order one in every color


So this dress wasn’t completely horrible. It is a thin material so somewhat see through. The fit was nice, just a little snug. The issue is the length! The dress stopped a good 6” above my feet so not a maxi dress. I’m not tall, 5’6” and the Xl was WAY too short!! I really wish it would have been the correct length otherwise I would have kept it.
