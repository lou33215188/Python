I like the dress but the fabric is so thin it doesn't hid any bra lines or back fat. I'm keeping it because I still like the dress but I might wear a vest with it.


THIS IS A SUPER VALUE THAT FITS GREAT THAT I CAN ACCESSORIZE


Very comfortable! -- Pockets are amazing!


Mine was delivered with holes in ti.


I’m 5’7 and though it fits. The length is shorter then it looks like it’d fit in the picture .


Love these


Very pretty! Long enough (little above the floor - I am 5' 8").Soft material, good color (purple). Shipped quickly.


great dress, but super duper thin.


This dress is so comfortable!!! Although it was a little longer on me because I'm short it still was cute and comfy!!!! I would recommend buying it...


Loved it so much I want to buy more colors
