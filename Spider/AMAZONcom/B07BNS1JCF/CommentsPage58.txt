Light, comfy and Versatel! Easy to dress up or stay casual! Definitely going to buy a few more colors!


Love the pocket and the fit


Looks like I’m wearing a nightgown. I gave it to a friend. Sleeves and length were also super long.


Awesome dress. Adorable on. I’m a size 4-6 and 36 bust and got a M and it’s perfect. Only got 4 stars because the dress smelled like smoke for some reason.


Very pretty dress, comfortable and fits well.  I will wear this on Christmas day!


This product was a great fabric and fit okay. It was just a little too short. I am 5’7” and I could barely wear flats after stretching it. I like my dresses to the ground. Over all it is a beautiful dress and was comfortable.


I'm 5'1", so this was very, very long on me.


I love this dress. Very comfortable and true to size. I can dress it up or down.  Received lots of compliments.


Returned the purple and voughht the black, more my color but the fabric is soft, size is accurate, very comfy dress


Bought this for my teenage daughter. It fit her beautifully and she wears it all the time. I think we will get more in other colors.


Wore this for my gender reveal, loved it and got so many compliments. I didn’t like however that the band underneath the chest dug into my skin and made me really red. It got super uncomfortable. I even ordered a size or two up because I didn’t know how big I would be..
