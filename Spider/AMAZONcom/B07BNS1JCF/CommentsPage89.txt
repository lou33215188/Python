This dress makes you feel PRETTY!!


So beautiful..


I absolutely love it! Itâ€™s so comfortable. It feels like piko brand, but cheaper!


Love it!


Love this dress. It fitted perfectly. I wear it to the office and dress it up and down.


It is cute and fits fine, but the material is thin and it is see through. I got it in navy, so it's not a color issue. I guess I'll have to wear a sweater over it. Disappointing to say the least.


Very comfortable, but the material stains very easily.


Great buy! Very good fit and very comfortable.


Looks great fits great. Make sure to measure yourself first to get it right. I do wish that the shipment was a little bit faster but other then that its a great buy.


Pockets are a plus as is the length,(I'm 5'10). Material is thin. Good for running errands.
