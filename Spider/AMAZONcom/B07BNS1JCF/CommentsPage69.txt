Love the dress.... comfortable and stylish.... size one down, runs a little large


Comfortable and looks nice.


Fit and color were as expected.


I like the fit of dress. I order XXL and it did not hug my stomach so I really liked that. I wish that was longer. I am 5'10 and love the long dress that covers the top of my feet this one covers the ankle. All and all I will order again. I did order this dress in 2 different colors and both fit the same.


This dress was made too small. Sleeve very smh and dress larger. Made missed sized.


I’m 5’8.5” 170lbs and the large fits great.


Does not touch the ground though.


Very nice and comfortable. I can dress it up or wear it for more casual occasions. Love the pockets.


I love this dress.  it was a little see through so i just threw on a tank top.  Fits perfectly.


I got this for my daughter. Fits great and looks fantastic. Best feature, pockets!


Omg, I absolutely love this dress. I ordered tbe black and wine color. I recieved so many compliments from people who were wanting to purchase one.
