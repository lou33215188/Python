Comfortable, moves nicely, the pockets are great! A bit long on me (I'm 5'6") so I'll hem it. Better too long than too short!


Beautiful dress that I've gotten so many compliments on. I pair it with a scarf or long statement necklace and it's such a great look! Slightly thin so I do have to wear a slip, but for the price it's a great buy! Ordered a second one in black!


It's quite sheer and a bit short for my taste- hits at about my ankles, I am 5'6".  Otherwise very comfortable.


I LOVE THIS DRESS! Fits perfect! I'm 5'1 and I can walk fine-not too long! So comfortable and FAST shipping. Ordering more in different colors.


It's a very nice material, but as I tried to wear it, I found that it was sent to me torn from under the arms!


I am so glad I bought this in black! Its going to be a staple in my rotation :) The size is perfect - 5'6, larger frame, busty (44C). It comes to my ankles - will be cute with sandals or flats. Love, Love, Love it!


I absolutely adore this dress! It's very comfy. The size was perfect and I'm looking forward to ordering more in other colors!


Love it
