Absolutely love this dress so comfy sizing spt on


Love the dress and the way it fits but had three stains on the black of the sleeve. Just wore a jacket with it!


Would have been a 5 star rating but there is a hole in the back of the dress


I ordered a small and dress is very long.  I would have to wear high heels.....


I love this dress


Comfortable! Can be dressed up or down.


Super cute & fits as expected. I’m 5’7 & it is long enough!!!


Love these dresses! Perfect for the fall :)


Very nice dress. I older a 2X and I’m 5’10.5. It hangs right above my ankles.


I love this dress. The brown is beautiful. I am ordering more!!
