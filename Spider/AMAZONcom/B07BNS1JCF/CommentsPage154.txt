Way to small


It is so comfortable. The color is nice too.


Very soft.


I bought the dress in red. As soon as I tried it on my husband loved it.I bought a small. I am 5'3"and weigh 125.  It is very similar to the Ana dress in Lula Roe, however this one has pockets which is a plus. It is very long.  I  Will have to wear heels. It should be perfect for Valentines.


For the price it is fine.  Haven't laundered it yet so we'll find out


Got this as a gift. Nice fabric and fit just right. Compliments the figure and just the right length. I am 5'7'' and got an XXL. Was perfect for my elf outfit and also for just a nice dress to wear. Even better with a waist belt.


ok


I am a medium in most dresses/shirts, I went by the reviews and ordered a large.  I am not huge chested by glad I sized up one.


I am 5'5 245lbs. I purchased the 2xl and it fit perfectly. The material is a little thin but its very comfortable.


I love this dress and received so many compliments when I wore it. Plus you can never go wrong with pockets. I wish I had bought more colors. It was so comfortable and moves great!
