This dress was great for maternity photos!


Purchased for my daughter in Small It's beautiful but a little tight around the bust area she's a 36B. The length is ok she 5'5" overall I like it


I get so many compliments on this dress! Great quality and love it. It did take about half a month to a month to be delivered. Other than that it is a great product.


So soft and comfy. Love it!


I love this dress! I received so many compliments. I fit and looked great.


For the most part this dress fit well.  If you have a large bust however be prepared to wear a cardigan at all times as the fabric becomes see-thru when stretched.  Very comfortable otherwise.

Beautiful and comfortable dress. The color is rich and stunning. Love the pockets as well! Itâ€™s perfect!


Very confortable, I bought three different colors, green one was too dark for me, but the red and purple are amazing!
