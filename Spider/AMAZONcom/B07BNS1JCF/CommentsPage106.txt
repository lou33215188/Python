So cute! Great fit and so comfy!


Very happy, love the dress thinking about getting in other colors


Dress was too short for me, I am 5'9 and it was a few inches off the floor. I returned but it would have been perfect if it was longer.


Very comfortable and exactly what i expected.


Beautiful dress. Great fit. I had to buy a slip to wear under it because it is thin. I am 5’7” 170 lbs and typically wear a size 12. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly.


I get tons of compliments every time I wear this.  No ironing.  Wash and wear.  Very comfortable.


I wear a 2x or 3x in a lot of my clothes buy this dress was way to tight.


Love this dress!  It’s pretty thin fabric and not super flowy at the waist/bottom. I wore a fur vest to dress it up for a fancy night out. Just perfect!


I love the dress! I am 4'11 so I was sure it would be a bit long. However, once I have those minor alterations I will be wearing these all winter long!!!! Outfits already made!!!


Great quality material. Arrived on time. A really nice causal dress.
