I really like this dress. I ordered a size small. Iâ€™m 4â€™11â€� and about 140 pounds. Iâ€™m happy that it fits material is super stretchy and comfortable. I will definitely buy it again in other colors


Good black dress for travel.  Packs small and doesn't wrinkle.  Soft jersey fabric.


Just Right for me and I'm fairly tall.. . .the dress is long enough, roomy enough and perfect for me.


idk about y'all but this dress looking absolutely amazing on me. The material is super comfy, and it has freaking pockets so really nothing else matters. I'm 5'2 and weigh about 100lb and the small fit as if it was made just for me. Will buy again in all the damn colors


I ordered a extra large because I'm 5'9 and 165lbs and wanted the length. It is a little big but not bad.  I love this dress so much that I ordered a second one!


Was a little smaller than i expected in the skirt area. but has a lot of stretch. lighter weight material than expected.


I wish i could get commission for selling these dresses. I love them! I am 5 ft 4 in and the length is perfect for me. I feel like I'm dressed up when really I'm hiding my postpartum body ğŸ¤·â€�â™€ï¸� so many compliments and now I basically twin with someone at work each day due to everyone buying these after seeing me in them!


As a plus size woman it's tough to guesstimate sizes online,  but I winged it and ordered a 2x and it fits perfectly, it's comfy and light,  I was afraid the fabric would be the itchy kind but it's not,  I bought this as a Halloween dress for my witch outfit but I'm loving so much it has become an everyday wear dress, plus the pockets are a real God send. All in all l,  I LOVE IT!!!


The material is not what is on the listing. The listing says polyester, the tag on the dress says Rayon. Very disappointing.


Great dress. I have gotten a lot of compliments. Very Long! but I am pretty short at 5 ft 1 in. I haven't washed it yet but the material seems soft and well made for the price.
