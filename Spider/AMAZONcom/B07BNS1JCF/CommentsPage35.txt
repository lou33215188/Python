So comfortable!.. At 5'7" the length for me hit just at the top of my feet.


Fits very well, just have to wait for it to get cold to wear it.  Love the chocolate color


I love the dress. Very long- dressing it up with some heels. It’s a perfect fit for me!


Comfortable, cute, and inexpensive! I’m 5’4” the large was a little long so I wore heels.


This is one of my favorite dresses. It's long sleeve so I never freeze in my office. It has pockets(winning!)! The color is bright even after washing it a few times. It can be dressed up or down for the occasion.


Comfy. Soft. I’m 5’8” and the length was great! It’s nit a high quality fabric. So i will wash on delicate and air dry


I love this dress! It has pockets!!! And it fits me. I hesitate to order clothes on line because they never fit and I either have to send them back at my expense or I keep them thinking one day it will fit. But this dress fit right off the bat. I have ordered either the long sleeve or short sleeve in 6 different colors. I have gotten lots of compliments too!


This dress is awesommmeeee. I ordered some in other colors too! It fits exactly as expected and does a fantastic job of making me feel confident on those not so body positive type days.


Very comfortable, love the pockets! The fabric is a little thin (thus the three stars).


The dress itself was long but that was expected because I’m so short. However you can really dress this baby up without spending too much! I used this for my engagement pictures.
