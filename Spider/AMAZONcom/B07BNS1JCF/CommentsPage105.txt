It’s comfortable. But you have to wear some sort of undershirt/tank/cami under it as it is somewhat thin and see through. All in all I like it.


Super comfy dress! Want to buy another! Shipped quick!


I love this dress. It is a lot darker then in the picture.


Too short for me, 5’8” 136 lbs. Had to return both small and medium.


I was disappointed, not only in the fit, but the 4 weeks it took to arrive directly from China. I should send it back, but did not receive any directions for how to do so.


Color’s beautiful.  It’s too small, and there was a rip on the arm at the arm.


I love how this dress feels.  I'm about a size 12, and ordered a Lg. ... it's a little thin across the chest, so I wear a tank under it.


So comfotable. Am 5'4" and 105lbs and the small fit just right (not snug at all)


loved the fit and style! The material could have been a wee bit thicker, but all in all great!  OH! FYI, No dryer


Great material. Great price. I ordered for my baby shower and was very pleased. I received many compliments.
