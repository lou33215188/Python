Purchased for girlfriend.


5 10 140 lb got her a medium fit like a tent!


Liked it so much I bought another in a different color.


I’m 5’5 and 285lb and purchased the XXL, it’s bigger then I liked but it’s super comfy. It’s very stretchy so could have sized down.


Just ordered my 3rd dress..so that says it all!!


Large but I love it I made some changes on the large but everything else was perfect


Beautiful! It fits great and hugs my curves. I love it!


I was super bummed because the fabric is super sheer.  You could see by bra right through the top.  It would have been cute if the fabric was thicker!


Runs a bit small but it's very comfortable. quality is average


Very comfortable. Little see through up top. I'm 5' and I got a medium and wore wedges and it fit perfectly.


I like the dress a lot! The only thing it’s too long, I’m 5’3 I have to cut about 2 inches off and re.hem.
