Bought this dress for my sister and she absolutely loved it.  She b said it was very comfortable and long enough, she's 5'5. Glad I bought it


Love the material super cute dress !!!!! Def high quality


I'm 5ft 6in. The dress for well, but was far too short.


I wore this for my baby shower. Even with my bump it touched the ground and was very flattering.


I liked how comfortable it was. Liked everything about it.


the color is perfect and fits just right


I love the pockets! But I also love how comfy the fabric is.


Beautiful dress,love the heavy fabric and itâ€™s so soft


Dress fit perfectly.  It is comfortable yet somewhat dressy.


Although the colour was not as shown on the model, but I still like it.
