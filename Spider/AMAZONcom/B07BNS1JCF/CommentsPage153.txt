I'm 5'7" 160lbs and bought a large.  It honestly fits perfectly, I just wish it was a few inches longer. Definitely don't put it in the dryer. EVER!


It was a good value and very soft and comfortable.


Cute but kinda see through


I'm 5'11, 165. I wear 10-14. The L was too tight at the empire waist so the XL was a keeper! It's perfect for fall! Hope it keeps well with washing.


fit as described, my wife love it


I absolutely love this dress. It is so comfortable & I get compliments on it all the time!


Beautiful dress, Fit Perfect...I ordered a Small- I'm 5'4 and 150 lbs (gym fanatic) the length was just right and the belly & arm area was great as well... such a nice flow dress


Will Def order again


I love it!!


Hem at the bottom is unraveling already. Otherwise very comfortable and fits great!


This dress is great quality and fit me like a glove! I canâ€™t wait to wear it on a date night!
