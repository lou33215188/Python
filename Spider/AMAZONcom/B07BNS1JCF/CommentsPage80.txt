Cute for the price and easy to throw on but elastic under breast area is not really elastic and doesn’t stretch so it’s kinda hard to put on, take off.  Only complaint I have. If that was more like elastic I’d buy it in another color!


On the right side of the stitching inside around the waiste band there is something itchy. Can’t find what it is, but probably can’t wear it again.


It doesn't go to the ground and I am 5'7''


So thin it is see through.


love this!


Wash and it shrunk .. not good quality


This is cute and comfortable, but started to pill after I'd washed it 3 times.


Sizes small


Simple cute! The picture does the simple elegance and quality of this dress no justice.


Nice fabric
