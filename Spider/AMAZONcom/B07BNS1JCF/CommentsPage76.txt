I love this dress. The fit is perfect and it’s so comfortable. I am 5’4” 160lbs and 34DD and I ordered a large. The only small issue was a separated seam on the side. Easy fix.


Fantastic dress!  (I'm the wife writing this review)  I've worn it a couple times and get complements from many people.  It looks great with my fair skin.


This fabric is comfy but wrinkles easily. It's a comfy fall dress


Super comfortable, soft material. Wouldn’t recommend for ladies shorter than 5’5”. I’m 5’5” and it drags the floor by about two inches. But very cute dress.


Dress looks great on.  The feel of the fabric is very good.  I was able to machine wash it and I hung it to dry.  Have worn it several times since.  Still looks very new.


very happy


So cute!


Very comfortable dress and washes well.


Absolutely love it! I’m 5’7, 190lbs, 43” hips, 34” waist and the x-large fit perfectly. The dress hem of the dress skims the floor.


Love this dress!! comfortable and modest!
