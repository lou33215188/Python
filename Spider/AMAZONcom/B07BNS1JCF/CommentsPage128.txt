Not as long as I expected but still a really pretty dress.


Fits great! I'm 5'5 and 130lbs. Very comfortable, I ordered a medium.


th dress fits really good and itâ€™s juat the right size


5'10. acutally long enough!


Loved it. I need one in every color!


True to size. Soft, jersey-like material. Itâ€™s thin, but not see through.


Love my dress... Will be ordering other colors ğŸ˜‰


My thirteen year old love  this watch! !!


I love the material and the long sleeves


Love the dress but extremely small and about 5â€� too long.
