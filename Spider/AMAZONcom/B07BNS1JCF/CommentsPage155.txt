Purchased this in two different colors. Fits perfectly. I'm 5'6, 144 pounds and I ordered the medium. Great buy, I definitely recommend it.


Fits as expected- a little snug in the arms though- soft and comfy- lightweight/ good for spring/summer-  colors seems accurate


Wish it was the littlest bit longer but I’m tall so I feel that way a lot! Great fabric and color. Fits perfectly.


Dress is great. Very comfortable! Ordered side XL I'm at size 14/16. Will order another!


I ordered the maroon one for Easter and it's amazing!  I'm short, 5'4", but I paired it with some wedges and it fit perfectly.  Everyone loved it, I'm ordering more for work!


POCKETS!


Not real impressed. But I guess you get what you pay for? I have a maxi collection from all kinds of boutiques so when I seen I was only paying 15 bucks I was all 'HECK YESS!!'.. unfortunately, it's alittle short in the length so I'll stick my 35-40 dollar ones!


I love this dress.  So comfortable.  Can dress it  up or down.  Best clothing purchase from online ever.  Fits perfectly and the pockets are awesome and un noticeable.


It had a hole on it, but I’m still keeping it!


Dress fits good and looks ok but the fabric is very thin. Good for the summer.
