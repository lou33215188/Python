I really like this dress. The only thing I would say is that I wish it would be as long on me as it is shown in the picture. It's just right above my feet. But the color is beautiful and it fits really well. I like that it looks so fancy, but it's as comfortable as sweatpants. If you are thinking about getting this dress, do it!


The dress came in very quickly, which I was super happy about. Opened it up and tried it on, I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS DRESS! Will be ordering in another color. I got a 2x for my 5’8” figure. I usually wear a 1x but wanted to be sure and it’s perfect. Not too tight around my bust. Very flattering!!!


Cute! A little long but I love it. Feels great!


I really like this dress- flattering, nice fabric etc. I'm 5'0" - got a small and shortened it a few inches.


I was just a little surprised by the neckline being more opened than how it appears on the model- so go more by what you see in the customer photos than on the model.


I love this dress and it's exactly what I've been searching for...T-shirt type maxi dress. I'll be ordering another color soon.


Best dress I have ever purchased! I've had tons of compliments!


Love this dress!  Looks great with scarf, necklace, or nothing. I cut the length to mid calf to wear with boots.  The sleeves were little long, but no problem in hemming little shorter....rather have them too long, than too short.  I am 5'8".


I love it! True to size. Im 5'8, about 160 (ordered a medium) and the length is perfect! The green isnt true to what is picture however the material is well crafted! Ordered in royal blue as well. Very happy


She looks great!


I love this dress! I am going to order it in more colors. I am 5'3 and I ordered a small. The dress skims the floor with my 4 in. boots. I will probably get it hemmed an inch or two, but it is worth it since the  dress is so affordable.
