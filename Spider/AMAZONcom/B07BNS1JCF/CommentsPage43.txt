Not insanely flattering but very comfortable. Purchased to wear while 7 months pregnant and it did look quite cute with the belly. Without the big belly it definitely adds girth to the midsection due to the cut under the breast but will continue wearing because the color is beautiful and it is so dang comfy. Neck is a bit to high to nurse in which is unfortunate.


Everyone asks me where I got this dress! And it has pockets! The only thing is that you can see underwear lines so I wear shorts under it.


I'm 5'6", 180- average bust and hips- and the XL fit perfect. I ordered the burgundy and the fabric is a little thin but not see through unless you really stretch it. Super comfy! It hits the floor as far as length. I don't trip on it but if I were any shorter I would. If I needed another long sleeve maxi I would definitely buy again.


love the fabric


This product is very true to size. I’ve ordered this dress in black and the wine color and I love it so much. The fabric is so soft . If your shorter then 5’6 you’ll need to him it as it falls just to the floor without boots, heels or wedges on me.


Excuse me while I go buy this dress in every color. I’m a teacher, and this dress is so comfortable. The pockets are a huge bonus.


This is my second purchase of a maxi dress from Amazon and I am just as pleased with this one.  The simple black can be worn as semi formal or as casual but either way this dress was perfect.  The fit and length for me, especially being 5'9, was just right with my wedges or flats. I love the simplicity of this dress and get a lot of compliments when I wear it.


It was a cute dress. It just didn't look good on me. Too small.


A little long and large, but sometimes such a fit is better than too tight. I am happy with it. I will wear it on Christmas after I hem it.


I like this dress very much.  It's really comfortable and I received compliments from my co-workers.  I will probably purchase another.
