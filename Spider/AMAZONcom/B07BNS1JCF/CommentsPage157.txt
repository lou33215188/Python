The color and fit is perfect. It is comfortable and the pockets don’t make it look bigger around your mid section. I bought 2 more colors!


This dress is absolutely perfect! It's beautiful to look at and feels amazing on. l am  5'10" and finding a maxi dress long enough is very hard. This one fits true. I'm going to buy more in all the colors now...


Medium fits perfect except for length - it drags the floor and I find myself holding it up as I walk (I'm 5'4" and 145 lbs).


I'm 5'9".  This dress was about 3 inches too short.


LOVE this dress!!! I ordered a small in red and blue based on other reviews since I’m 5’3 140 lbs. Perfect fit and it has pockets!!. Definitely looking to order more.


It’s a little thin, but fits as expected


These are super comfortable and flattering dresses. I would say they are true to size.


Thanks!


Perfect fit! Love this dress and it’s extremely flattering!


Loving this dress. It looks so elegant.
