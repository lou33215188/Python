So many compliments.  I'm 5'8" 125 lbs and bought the M.  I like things fitted and it's perfect, not too tight  not too big.  I love the length on me even with tall heels it's only an inch or so off the ground.


Material very flimsy and see through.


Love this dress. Fits as expected.


I want it in every color! So soft and the pocketsğŸ˜�


Not at all like the last dress. Material is flimsy and fit is terrible.  I will give it away.


Light weight stretchy material.  Littlehighwaisted.


Pretty. Just as expected


Love love Love!


I'm 5'7, it goes to my feet. I bought it in 2 more colors I loved it so much. Even though it's long sleeved and to the floor, I still have a shape when I wear it.


Great for Georgia winters!


It's so comfortable, the fabric is thin so you will need a sweater or something. I love that it has pockets and I am super comfortable in it.


Sadly it's see-through...BUT I still wear it with a full slip.
