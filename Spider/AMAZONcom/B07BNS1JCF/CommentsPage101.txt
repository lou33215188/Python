The dress is causal & classy!


A little long but super cute


Dress is exactly what I was looking for. Material is not cheap material and it is very, very comfortable. True to size as it says. I want this dress in every color!


So many compliments on this dress... and.... POCKETS!!! Yes! It’s a bit long so I have to wear heals with it, I’m 5.5.


This dress is perfect! the dark blue color is true to the picture, it is very soft, the pockets are great, and for being 5'3" a small falls perfectly to the ground without dragging. love it!


Really great dress for the price. The material is a little thin so when it stretched over my bust, it was just a little see-through. Totally fixable with a tank top.


Wonderful dress. Super flattering and I got a lot of great compliments at work.


Loved it just very long for a short person


Really cute dress!  It's a bit long on me but that's typical for a 5'2 girl.


Comfortable. Versatile. And it has pockets!
