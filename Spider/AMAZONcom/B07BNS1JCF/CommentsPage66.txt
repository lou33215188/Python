this is a very cute dress. it's a little long for me but it's stilll cute.


I love this dress!! The color is so striking! Lots of complements on it!


Really pretty and comfortable dress. I’m 5’3”, 120 lbs, and got the small—fits perfectly! And I love that it has pockets!!!


I normally wear a small in dresses.  I wear a 6 in jeans and a small in tops.  I ordered a medium in this dress after reading some of the reviews.  It fits perfectly.  The material is a little thin, but not a problem.  A good purchase for the money.  I am happy with the dress.


Fits well, soft, beautiful shade of green.


I have delivered two babies and I'm super self conscious about my belly. I ordered this for christmas pictures TOMORROW and it was delivered today so I was cutting it close! I am IN LOVE. I never expected to like it this much. I'm large chested with a mama belly and I love it. It's a bit long for my 5'3" frame but that's what heels are for!!


Buy it. Trust me. I debated it for days but it was worth every penny. I would have paid more money in stores if I would have tried it on. So flattering!


Such an amazing dress! I bought it to wear for my baby shower, as I am 9 months pregnant, and it fits so well! I’m excited because I bought it in a size I’ll be able to wear after I have baby. The fit and flow are great! The color is gorgeous! And the pockets?!? OMG! The pockets are what makes it!


The arms are nice and long, but it is shorter than I wanted (I'm 5'8), and it's too small.


Love the dress,  but its WAAY too small!!
