Soft material, very comfy! I am 5'9" so I was worried that it might be too short, but the length was great.


I'm 5'4", 130lb, and I got a size small. It fits great and is very comfortable. Love the pockets.


The dress is very comfortable and stylish. I didn’t give a 5 because it’s very long. I’m 5’5 and had to wear wedges just for it to hit the floor and not step on it.


compliments all the time


Ran smaller

The only maxi dress I’ve been able to find that’s long enough for my 5’11” frame.
