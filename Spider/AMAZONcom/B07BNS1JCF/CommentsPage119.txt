Love this comfy dress. My favorite part...pockets!


Very comfortable and a great price.


Absolutely love this dress. Planning on buying another color.


Very comfy soft material. Not too long... Im 5ft 3.  Wearing it this eve to dinner with wedge boots. Perfect.


I love it!!! Looks good on me and material feels good to!!!!


If you read the size chart. I find that it was true to size but in my regular size, I did have to go up a size.


Soft and flowing.


Ordered 2, purple and black. The purple one fit well but the black one was the wrong dress


Fits well...Im 5'4...small...however I wish it was a little longer...
