Beautiful dress, very flattering!


Perfect. I ordered the small. Im 5’6” and 7 months pregnant. I absolutely love it.


I get so many compliments on this dress. Fit as expected and it's so comfortable.


Longer than expected, but fits!


Beautiful dress, a little short for me, I’m 5’10 dress is above my ankles.


Smaller than thought, but good quality.


It fits great.


Was very happy to receive a dress that was actually true to size. So frustrating when items are 2 plus sizes too small.


Love!! So comfy! Fits as expected


Wife loves it!
