The entire bust area is see through.  I’m very surprised at this for a knit dress in a dark color.  It’s priced well, but I hate purchases that “require” the addition of other items (ie: cami or undershirt) to make them useable.


Beautiful dress and packaging was very good


I bought this dress in almost every color because it looks very nice on and is as comfortable as a nightgown. I suffer from a muscle disease And have chronic pain. I recommended this dress to over 30,000 people on chronic pain websites. Add knee socks and shoes and you’re ready to go


Sleeves too tight


Fabric feels cheap, the dress arrived damaged. With irremovable marks on the dress. The fabric was somewhat see through.


Very long, will have to get hemmed but will keep


If you have a larger bust  you may want to wear something under to prevent your bra from showing. Other than that the dress is so comfortable


Not like the picture shows. Kinda disappointed with the cheap material...not made with thick material which makes it see through. Wrinkles fast too.


I am 5'2" and this is the PERFECT length !!!


I love this dress super comfy. I'm 33 weeks pregnant and I bought this for my baby shower. It looked amazing. I ordered a medium (I'm 5'0 and weigh 150 pounds) due to the reviews and it fit perfectly. I had to tuck it into my bra in the front but that's just because I'm a shorty. If you're taller the length should be just fine for you.
