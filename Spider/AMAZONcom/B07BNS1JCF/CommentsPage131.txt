I like the color and it fits amazing


Product will not hold its shape.


Fits great, good fabric... love this dress! So comfy! Iâ€™m buying another!


Love love. Exactly as pictured.


I'm 5' 10 and this dress is long enough, roomy and sleeves are long enough.


I'm 5'7" 138 pounds. This dress is nice but a little short


This dress is so comfortable and fits perfectly!


Love.  So cute. My legs got cold though


Very nice dress... I just wish the fabric was a bit thicker.


Very pretty comfy dress.. I plan on ordering more!!
