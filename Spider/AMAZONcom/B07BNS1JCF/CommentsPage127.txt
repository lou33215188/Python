Love this dress, worn for my baby shower at 32 weeks pregnant. Just ordered up a size for my belly.


Beautiful dress and can't beat the price! Fit just as expected. I am 5'3" and a small fit me just right!


Even nicer than I expected in light of the low cost. Fits true to size.


The stretchy middle part is a little itchy.


Great fit and nice material!! So happy with my purchase.


100% Satisfied!
