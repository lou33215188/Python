I bought one red and one blue, both size medium. I am 5'6 and 138 lbs. The red fit as expected according to the website description while the blue was significantly smaller in length, at least by two inches. I had to return the blue one because I cannot wear it. Not sure why the sizes aren't all uniform. The model is 5'5'' and it shows a lot of extra fabric on the bottom. It's misleading.


Love this dress! Super comfy. Received LOTS of compliments the first day I wore it. It is very stretchy and I feel like I should have ordered a Large instead of XL, only because XL probably make a difference in length of the dress as well. But overall, I love it!


The dress is terrific.material really soft.love 5he pockets..sleeves are long but i love that ..can put braclets outside the sleeve..look good..downside is it runs big and its long..so i would order a smaller size..i put them in washer and dryer trying to shrink them a bit..i bought a black and a blue..the blue is like a purple..lovely dresses..just hope i can shrink them..


Absolutely in LOVE with this dress. Great quality and material. Such a steal for the price! Iâ€™m a big chesty and it fit nicely. Iâ€™m 5â€™7 195lbs and got a size Large. Length is perfect with a slight 2inch heel. Would be a little long on others that are short but Iâ€™m sure you could alter it.


Fit me as expected but I am short, 5'2" and it was just a little too long, so I did return it.  But the material is good, soft, and lots of the good kind os stretch & flow.  beautiful dress with pockets, wish it was just a little shorter.  :)


I ordered a XXL--I am a 44 DDD and I normally wear 2x or 18/20. It is rather tight through the chest area, but fits fine everywhere else. The material is a little thin so when it stretches over my chest, I can see my bra, but I plan on wearing something over it like a cute vest or denim jacket which should make this a non-issue. Needless to say, it's a little snug but I plan on keeping it, b/c overall I think it's very comfy and adorable!


Love this dress! Great long length, soft material, not too thin. Dress it up or wear it casually.. I'll be buying more colors. I sized up to get it a looser fit up top and have it more flowy since I'm bigger. 5' 8" 200 lbs , bought an XL


I absolutely love this dress. I normally wear a 14/16, am 5â€™7â€� and ordered a XL. Fits as expected and comes to my ankles. I love the pockets and it is very comfortable! Perfect for that in between weather. Packs easy and travels well with a iron touch up. Washed and did not experience any shrinkage; however I did let air dry.


I read of the reviews when I shopped for this dress to determine what size I needed and I am glad I did.  I ordered a size L and it was perfect.  It is a little long but it delays the length on the photo shown and that is nothing that a pair of heels can't fix.  I love the color and the material feels great on me.  I will post a picture when I wear the dress.  Overall I am happy with this purchase.


I love love love this dress ğŸ˜� Super comfortable you can dress up for casual or for a party I'm 5'4 138lb and the medium fits like glove .. totally recommended
