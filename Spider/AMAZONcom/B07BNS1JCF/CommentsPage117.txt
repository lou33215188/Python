Fabric is lighter than I expected but I will wear a cami under it anyway.


The material is very soft, the style is very simple.  For the price, it is very nice dress


Fits perfect! I am going to order all the colors. Super comfy with pockets!!!! GeniusğŸ’œ #happywife #happylife

Itâ€™s thin material but not bad for the price. Fit is good before washing but concerned it might shrink a lot if dried


Very comfortable
