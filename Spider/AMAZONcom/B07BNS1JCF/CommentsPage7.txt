I love this dress! So comfy and cute! Iâ€™m 5â€™7 and 118lbs and I got the small. Iâ€™m wearing flip flops in the picture so it did go to the ground wearing flats for me.


I'm 5'6 and 215lbs i ordered the xxl and the xl. I prefer the xxl cuz it gives the looseness i was looking for. The xl fits just right not too tight but form fitting and the length is perfect, it touches the floor where the xxl drags a little more than i would like. I love the material, although a tad thin but i like being able to layer without much bulk.


This is a comfortable dress that looks great and is easy to accessorize. It's a great basic piece that you can dress up with a scarf, cardigan or jewelry. Thankfully the fit was pretty good for me, but I can see where sizing would be nerve wracking for some. If you're busty, I highly recommend ordering a size up. I'm a DD and ordered an XL, and I have to wear a camisole underneath because the fabric is clingy and shear around the bust area. Also, it's a very long dress. I'm 5'6" and I have to wear some kind of heel or it will brush the floor. Overall, I'm very happy with the dress and will probably get another color soon.


First off I would like to say how amazingly fast the shipping was. I placed my order Wednesday night and received it today on Saturday! I was so back and forth as to what size to order going off of reviews, but I decided to get my standard size in most dresses/shirts which is an XL. It fits like a glove and is SO comfortable. The waistband is stretchy, the fabric is soft and flowy, and it has POCKETS! It is very flattering because it hides my problem areas (my tummy and love handles) but it makes everything else look great! I'm a 38C and it is perfect on the chest but it definitely stretches so if you are bustier, it will fit! I would definitley say order your true size. Oh I'm also 5'4 (and 3 quarters if we want to get super technical lol) and it hits perfectly almost all the way to ground but not dragging. I will be ordering more colors of this dress.


I bought it based off the reviews that didn't seem accurate. I'm  5'1 and 125lbs. I was looking for something with thicker fabric so it would drape well. Most dresses with long sleeves should be somewhat on the thicker side since you are typically wearing them in spring or fall, but I could see my bra through this it was so thin. It hung in a way that felt uncomplimentary and the pockets just made me look so much more hippy. I def. should have sized up to to a medium. As a petite, the arms fit well but the dress was way too long. I'd be worried if i were taller person with longer arms. This would be the perfect dress if you were the type of person who was looking for a dress that was light and offered sun coverage for summer.


Absolutely beautiful dress. I ordered the maroon color and it looks really nice on. I wore it for an indoor event. I am 5â€™1, 34C and 140 lbs. I ordered a small and it fit fine, but was long. I wore 3-4 inch heels and my feet were completely covered (but I wasnâ€™t tripping)


The only reason I am not rating any higher is because the dress is very see through in the bust area with flash photography. All of my pictures from the event had to be cropped at the neck. It is not see through in person though. I am still going to continue wearing this in a more casual environment, with less pictures or with a scarf/jacket.


Iâ€™d still recommend buying this dress, just understand its a but see through with flash photography.


Before I could even wear this i noticed a tear or hole in the seam across the waste. I had never worn this before so clearly it came out of the package that way. Ordered one for my older daughter too and hers also had a hole. I'll never buy these again.  In the photo below that is my pinky finger coming through the hole. The hole in the other dress was even bigger. I actually had to pull out my machine and stitch it up.


Love this dress! The fabric is thin and breezy but not see through. The pockets are awesome! Iâ€™m 5â€™9â€� and ~140 lbs and I ordered a large. It fits be beautifully. I usually waffle between large and medium so Iâ€™m glad I decided on a large for this one. Even being pretty tall, this dress is plenty long. It just barely floats above the floor, exactly where it should be. The color is beautiful, exactly as pictured. If it holds up well in the wash I will definitely be buying more colors. This is such a multipurpose dress.


This dress is unbelievable for the price!  I ordered the dark green in a size L for Christmas.  Iâ€™m a US size 8, 36DD/DDD, wide hips.  I got SO many compliments!  It is so soft and flowly. I love the long sleeves and the fact thereâ€™s pockets! Iâ€™m defiantly ordering more.  The one thing to watch is that it is very long. Iâ€™m 5â€™5â€� and I wore high heeled booths and my heals got stuck on the dress a couple times while going up steps or getting and and out of the car.  Still LOVE it though!


I like the fit and the feel.  The only thing I am not comfortable with is the elastic that is supposed to be closer to the waist.  It is very possible that it is because my bust is more protuberant than the model and some of the other customers who shared their pictures after purchasing.  I did not want to go up a size because I would then have to cut/hem and that would take away from the dress as the fabric is so soft.  I will dress it up so that the fullness is not so obvious.
