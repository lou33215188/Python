I loved it.  The medium was a perfect fit.  Can't wait to order other colors


Pretty and soft.  I really like.  It is long so plan on wearing heels if you are 5'3".


Dress came on time, and was exactly what I expected.

Horrible. The fabric is completely see through. I waited too long to return the item and am now stuck with the dress.


God quality material and perfect length. I am 5'11 and I like my dresses at my ankles and this one covers my ankles. I want it in more colors.
