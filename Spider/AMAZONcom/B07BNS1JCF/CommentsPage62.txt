I got so many compliments on this easy to wear dress!!


IT'S A NICE DRESS.  JUST VERY LONG AND A BIT TOO SMALL.


My favorite super comfortable....5' 9 size 16 slightly sweeps the floor....2xl


I am 5'10 weighing 200ish and I was disappointed with this product. The material is really thin and you can see my bra easily (and I am not large at all in the chest area) and my underwear. The bottom of the dress was also hitting me about an inch above my ankle and it looked like I was waiting on a flood.


This dress is made of very cheap material.  It's soft, but almost see through.  Love the style but not the material.  Returning this item.


Cute but runs small. I had to return the small and I am 5’7 125 lbs. the dress was too tight where the band is below my bra.


Lovely, comfortable and looks great.


Comfortable, soft and perfect for relaxing in.


Love love nice fit  casual yet can be dressy with right accessories


I’m 5’6” 135 lbs. and got a size medium, its an 1” too short though and poor material
