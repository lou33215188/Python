So cute and perfect. Could definitely seem some folks needing to get it hemmed, though. I am 5'4" and wear ankle booths with a small heel and the length is perfect.


Liked the dress but it didn't look good on me.


This dress is so comfortable and fits great. The length of this dress is perfect too, I am 5'7 and wearing my boots it falls right at my ankle so when I walk my boots show. I may have to buy this same dress in a different color, I love it that much.


This is such a luxurious treat to wear around the house and to bed.


Very comfortable and pretty dress. I bought the olive green, will buy again in another color


Beautiful color but too warm for the event I had planned. I do hope on wearing it soon.


Very nice.  Just as pictured.  Good quality.


This dress is perfect.It is long and flowing, very comfortable and easy to accessorize. I find just adding a high waist belt can take the dress from afternoon casual to fun girls night out.


This dress is PERFECT. It’s super flattering. I’ll be purchasing in other colors!


I’ve bought this same dress in 3 different colors; the purple being the most recent. I must say I LOVE this dress, it’s a little on the thin side so you may want to have more than your skivvies on underneath if you’re wearing it for work. The pockets are the best and even with the long sleeves it’s not a strictly for winter dress.
