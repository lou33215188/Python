Just wore this to a wedding as a maternity dress, ordered a large, I'm 33 1/2 weeks pregnant and it fit great.


The dress is beautiful and comfortable I wish I would have went up a size ordered a large black but I have big arms from sports but that's my problem.. will order another in different color or same my mom plans to take this one after I've worn and washed it lol


Excellent dress. Wire it to work and got a lot of compliments! Breathable and good fabric that I expect to last a long time. Very comfortable.


I love this dress. My only complaint is I’m 5’7 and it doesn’t reach the floor as I had expected it to. Still a good buy!


Pros: nice color and soft fabric


Cons: poor stitching (it came with a one inch gap on a seam) and fabric wrinkles easily


Fabric is a little thin. It's a great length and the sleeves are long enough. I love the pockets! Color is brilliant!


I get so many compliments when I wear this dress.  I love that it has pockets and is so comfortable!


Very nice for price -can dress up or down-always nice to have a black dress -for the unexpected/last minute back up!


Color is very nice. Looks just like the picture, but not on me. If you have a waistline, it would be lovely and flattering.


LOVE.  i ordered navy and black and am thrilled.  I am 5'9 and wear between a 14 and 16... I ordered XL and it fits perfectly
