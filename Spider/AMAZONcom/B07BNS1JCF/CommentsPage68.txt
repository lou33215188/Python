Very comfortable and decent quality. Length is a tiny bit shorter than I had hoped. I’m almost 5’8” and ordered a medium. Cannot wear with heels if you want your feet / ankles covered.


I love this dress. I have recommended it to several ladies I work with. (I'm 5'5" tall and 175lbs. I ordered a Medium and it fits perfectly.)


Great for my job, Thank you


This dress is exactly as described. It is comfortable and beautiful. It is true to size.


Pretty color & dress.


Extremely good quality, delivered on time, and it fits so well! I love it.. you will not be disappointed... highly recommend!!


Although cute, the length of this dress does not work for me at 5’11. Hits above the ankles.


I love these! Will probably buy one of every color! It's so soft! I got a medium. I'm 5'4, 125 lbs. It fits prefect and it hits the floor.


Absolutely love this dress. Comfortable, can dress up or down. Will get another in a different color


Purple color is not accurate
