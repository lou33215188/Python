Describe.


May I didn't read the details carefully. I thought the dress was going to have a pleat in the in the front dress.


I really loved this dress, the fabric, and length but it did not look good on my body so I returned it hassle free.


Nice dresses, but the material on top is a little see through. Always wear them with a tank underneath.


i'm 5ft 9in & about 140-145 pounds. fit's so comfortably. nice material. hem is just off the ground. i can wear flats or dress it up w/heels. no complaints.


I’m always looking for long casual dresses to wear. This one is perfect! I can dress it up with accessories or keep it simple. I’m going to order it in Black as well.


So comfy! Bought this for a wedding and I loved it, then another wedding next to us had all 10 bridesmaids wearing these


It's beautiful, fits perfectly. I thought I was going to have to get it hemmed, since I am petite  (5'2") but i am happy with the length. With heels it will just barely touch the floor. Perfect for the occasion.


It was small for me I will recommend to go a size larger, IM ALWAYS a Medium, I regret not to get the Large


This dress is great,so comfortable and cute!  I'm 5'6" / 150 lbs and the medium fit me perfectly, just barely touching the ground. The fabric is nice as well. Definitely recommend!
