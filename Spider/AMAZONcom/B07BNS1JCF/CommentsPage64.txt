Ordered the dress for African Heritage Sunday,  stress was late so decided to start this morning.  Haven't tried the dress on but noticed it has a hole. Really!!


Also I'm 5'8, dress is not as long as picture.  Haven't tried the dress on but the hold up don't lie!


Fit as expected and soft fabric. However it was way too long for someone who is 5'3. Also if you are big chested, the fabric does get slightly see through as it stretches.


We’re like an old ladies dress


Color is even prettier in person. Soft and float doesn't put emphasis on my mom belly and it has pockets!! Arrived to me before the expected shipping time and in great confusion.


Extremely comfortable and I was so surprised that it fit


As stated it is a loose fit but SO soft and comfy!


so comfy!! great for maternity wear!!


I love this dress! It's so comfortable! I went a size up & it fit perfectly.


Great dress that I can dress up for work or down for the weekend. A little snug up top. Overall great dress


This dress is very comfortable and is super cute!


I’m 5’7 and ordered a small and it fits perfectly. Wish it was a tiny bit longer, but I still love it.
