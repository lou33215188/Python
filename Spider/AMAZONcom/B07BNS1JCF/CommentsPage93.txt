I love this dress. I ordered it for Thanksgiving. I read the reviews and ordered a larger size which was an XXL. An XL would have been just fine. So it is true to size. Order your normal size.


Love love love this. I’m getting one in every color. Fits great, love the length, love the material.


Love it. Very flattering.


This dress is my new favorite! Very flattering, color is vibrant, and it's also incredibly comfortable for everyday wear. My husband even commented how nice I looked. I think I'll order another one in a different color!


5’8 size 16 with hips and butt(pear shaped). I ordered an XL black longsleeved and it fits perfectly! It’s nice and long. The wrinkles steamed out smoothly. I will be ordering a shortsleeved for summer.


My daughter loves this and wears it all the time.


When I received this dress I immediately washed and dried it and then tried it on and it was about 3-4 inches short. I hung it on a hanger on a door over night and put it on the next day and it stretched to the perfect floor length.


Ordered an XL, cause that's the size I wear, and it's way to big on me.  It's very unflattering.  Very disappointing.


This is my new favorite dress!! Fits wonderfully, looks fantastic casual or dressed up, and soooooo comfy!!!  Well done!


Wife loved it. Fits nice and looks great.
