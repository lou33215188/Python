It was ok.


Good price point and comfy


Love it ! Fits great.


Really nice fabric; Nice feel and not too stretchy. It's a little too long, but I'm only 5' so everything is too long on me. Otherwise, the medium fits perfectly.


Super cute and fit perfectly.  I will be ordering more in different colors


Much darker green than what I thought


I really like the dress. It's just a size off.


Dress fit perfectly and the length was spot on. I’m 5’8 and the length was perfect on me.


I love this dress! it's the second one I've ordered! it fits great it washes great love it!


When I wore this dress I received a ton of compliments from my coworkers and students. I am a teacher and this dress is super comfortable.
