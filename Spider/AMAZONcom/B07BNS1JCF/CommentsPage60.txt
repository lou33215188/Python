We ordered this dress to be the base of a Merida (from Disney's BrAve) costume for my 19 year old daughter last Halloween.  Arrived and fit perfectly!  Worked perfectly as the costume. With additions of fold braid at wrists and collar, plus some other accoutrements.

Too tight under the bust.


Just return the dresses. Do not exchange cancel the dress.


Very nicely made dress. Extremely comfortable.


Love it! I considered purchasing other colors! So comfortable and LOVE that it has pockets!!


I purchased a size large. I am 5'2, 185 pounds, chest 38 DD and it fit fabulous. You can dress it up or dress it down!


I LOVE this dress! It is so comfortable and I can't wait to see how it turns out in photos for our engagement shoot. ğŸ˜�


This dress is darling on. I'm 5'8" and 140lbs.  It fits great. It actually covers my feet! I ordered a size L.


It fits well. The only problem I have is if itâ€™s to be a high waist or umpire.


Nice material, however slightly see through.


I ordered a size up, which was recommended and it fit well. The dress is a little long, but I am 5'3.  I own two of these now, I work at home and it's as comfortable as lounge wear, but fully functional to wear out and about.
