I like the way the dress fits it's just so long so I'm going to have to send it to retailer for shortening. Other than that is beautiful love the pockets


I am height 5.5 inches,


165 Lb,


chest 38 inches,


Waist 35 inches


hips 44 inches.


Excellent. I lake the fabric.


It was nice but too long and the waist band was bothering.


Got lots of complements and a friend requested to borrow it also. Very Comfortable


I’m a Size 10, bought a large and seriously tight across my chest. The elastic band is awkward and uncomfortable. Length is good, I’m 5’6”


Arrived balled up and wrinkled in package. Returned.


Fit nice but very thin material. Sent back.


Sent back due to pockets that bulges out. The material is nice but the pockets ruin the dress


Loved this dress, and got lots of compliments


This dress is long but looks amazing. I bought green and wine red. Wine red is a beautiful color. The green one is a lil off from what you see in the picture. Still they are comfy and fit perfectly. I am 5'3 and 150 pounds and ordered the large. It was long but I love the flowy-ness and it fit perfect every other way. Thank you
