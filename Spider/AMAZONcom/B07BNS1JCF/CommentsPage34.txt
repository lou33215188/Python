The dress is really soft but it is short. Hits above the ankles. I’m 5’5 and about 165 pounds. Ordered a Small. It fit everywhere but the length. The pockets also hit on the hips so not very flattering.


Beautiful lines and comfort. Pockets are deep and the dress really flows.


Measurements on size chart are totally off!! I’m a Medium. But it fits as a small.


I was worried about the quality, considering the price but I was extremely impressed when I received it. It's beautiful! Looks like a $100 dress! I'm 5'2", 180 lbs. I ordered a large. Fits amazing and length is perfect. Definitely buying more colors!


I loved the color of this dress, but it was too small and the waist was too low for it to look right on my shape. I returned the dress, but would buy it again if I lose some weight in order for it to look right on me.


I love this dress, it fits as expected although a little long.  The material is soft and I ended up purchase another one because I love the dress so.  I am definitely happy with my purchase.


I love this dress and since I have bought it, I have bought four more. I do wish it was a little thicker at top so you couldn't see through it without wearing a undershirt. But overall very comfy and well made.


Dress is cute and soft - would be so comfy if it wasn’t so long.


I really liked this dress. However, if you are tall (5ft 8in), it will be too short. Luckily for me, my mom is quite short and it fits her perfectly in length. It's a beautiful color and the fabric is nice.


I wish that they offered length for us tall ones.


I'm a size 10 and I got a medium. I guess I should have gotten a large. I do love the dress and it has pockets...bonus..
