Love love love this dress I'm a maxi dress kind of woman lol 5"4 201 fits perfect I'm very small at top so it wasn't big fitting in that area its like they made this dress especially for me lol ordered in another color the same day I got this one in the mail its a must buy ladies


This dress is amazing! Super soft and comfy, plus flattering! Not see-through. I bought a size medium in black, I measure, bust:36â€�,waist 32â€�, hips 41â€�, size medium in most tops, size 10 in pants. The dress is long, but Iâ€™m 5â€™1â€� so it touches the floor even when wearing heels, but I donâ€™t mind the length. The material is stretchy and cool to the touch, also super soft! I am extremely happy I bought it!

Love it .. could have gone for a small, but I think it's great..I'm 5"4 130 lbs


This dress is wonderful! I love it! I wear size 16 and bought the XL. It fits perfectly!!! It is slightly thin as you can see from one of the pictures, but I canâ€™t complain.


I bought this on 10/30 around 9AM and it arrived 10/31 around 12PM! I am so happy with this purchase. It also has pockets which were a plus for trick or treating. I can also use Atina for casual night out! LOVED this!


I am thrilled with this dress! I ordered the dark green and the color is beautiful. I am 5'9 125lbs and a 34D. I ordered the medium and it is a perfect fit.


I absolutely love this dress! It is so soft and comfortable! I am 5"1 135 lbs and 32 D and ordered a small.


I couldn't be happier. I will definitely be ordering more. I love the fact it has pockets!!


Love this dress! I will be buying every color! The sizing is true to size. I am a size 16..the xl fits perfectly! Length is good . Comes to my ankles. My height is between 5â€™5 - 5â€™6 ! You will not be disappointed with this dress


Always get compliments on this dress.. and I can still nurse my munchkin in it by pulling the neck down.
