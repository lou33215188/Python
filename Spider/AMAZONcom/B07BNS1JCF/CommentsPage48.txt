I love this dress! Only four stars though.. I have relatively long arms and the sleeves in this dress are far too long for me, I have to roll them up. Other than that everything is amazing.


This dress was better than I expected.  I'm 5'5' size 0.  I ordered a small and it fit me perfectly (even in length).  It was so comfortable and I loved that it had pockets on the side.  I am going to order a few more in different colors.


I love this dress. I wore it on a dressy occasion with accessories and heels and then to a super casual occasion with sandals and received a lot of compliments at each event. And it has pockets! This dress is so versatile and comfortable I think I'm going to need more of them.


Needs to be hemmed ....but nice dress.  I felt the medium was also long and had it hemmed.  I am 5'3".  It's a stretchy material.  But the colors are nice and I like the long sleeves.


Was a great deal, it's not super high quality material or anything but for 20 bucks it's a perfect maxi dress and looks great with a blanket scarf, and it has pockets which is so fun!


It's see through


Love this dress- I ended up buying it in both the black and maroon. I am 5'1" 135 lbs and bought a size small. Very comfortable and flattering.


I love this dress, you feel so comfortable while wearing it and it's a nice quality for the low cost.


Nice cotton material. Its ankle length and color is niceeeeee. Great buy. Im a size 12 and a large fits PERFECT.


Thick material and it’s stretchy. Just had a baby and was trying to find something that was flattering since my body isn’t quite itself again yet. I’m 5’9 and this was long enough where it just touched the floor but didn’t drag.
