Based on the other reviews, the dress fit as expected. I'm about 5'2" and 120 lbs, and the small fit well, snug at the waistband, but comfortable. The dress is definitely a bit long. I wore the it w/ 3.5" booties, and it just touched the ground. Definitely a solid purchase.


Loved every thing about this dress it was a little bit at first but after he first  wash it fit perfect


Feels & looks great!


Bought this dress in black and green and I love it. Received so many compliments. Cheap and cute is my style!


Very nice for the price. Fits me perfectly even with a 34w bump. Recommend! :)probably will order again at some point!


I wear an 18/20 in anything that has to honkver my hips, thighs and butt. I ordered an XL and it fit beautifully. I ordered two dresses: Black and Wine red. The black dress was black, however the wine red looked brown.


Great fit!!! I love this dress!!


Love it! I ordered a L, I’m 5’6” 165lbs post baby. Just delivered 6 weeks ago. I probably could have ordered a M, but the L fits perfectly and isn’t skin tight. Just the right length when wearing flats with it. Material is thin but not too thin. The pockets are a huge plus!!


Really cute! A little thinner that what I expected but still very cute! I’m 5’7” and it was just the right length!


I was so excited to receive this dress, but when I tried it on it was almost tissue paper thin.  One would absolutely have to wear a slip underneath.  I hate slips and I get hot easily, so this really wasn't an option for me.  I'm really sorry the dress didn't work out for me.
