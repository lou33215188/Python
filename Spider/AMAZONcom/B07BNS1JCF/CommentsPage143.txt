Love!


Perfect length I ordered a small, I am 5â€™2 135 and it fits perfectly. Itâ€™s super comfortable and I love the pockets.


I just got this yesterday, wore it today...also ordered in black, and I'm glad I did. It's lightweight, HAS POCKETS, super soft fabric. I'm 5'7", 240, size 16-18. Ordered XXL. It's not tight at all, it would probably be more snug for a size 20, or a larger chest. I wore flats, and it was the perfect length. Heels would be needed if you are shorter. I haven't had a chance to wash or wear mulitple times, but initially I am extremely satisfied with the quality and the style of this dress.


Fits great! Came right on time for me to wear to a gala!ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


I purchased this maxi dress in wine.  The material is soft, a bit stretchy, & slightly sheer.  I usually wear a beige bra.  But, the bra showed through the fabric.  So, I had to put on a darker taupe color bra with this dress.  You'll want to wear a slip w/ this dress.  It helps it glide over any pantie lines or bumps you don't want noticed.  I'm 5' 3 1/2" tall, weigh 130lbs, & wear a 36C bra.  I purchased the dress in size medium & it fits me perfectly.  It is rather long.  I plan on wearing it with ankle boots that have a 2 1/2" heel.  I need to have the dress hemmed 1 1/2" to keep it from dragging on the floor w/ the 2 1/2" heels.  The 1 1/2" hem will leave the dress just a bit above the floor.  I don't have a surger on my sewing machine.  So, I will spend the money to have the dress hemmed.  I read quite a few previous reviews.  So, the length was not a surprise.  This dress is worth the additional cost of having it professionally hemmed.  The dress is extremely flattering.  It can be styled for a dressy look or a super casual look.  I put it on w/ my boots & a denim jacket and my husband loved it.  I also tried it with different scarves & jewelry and liked every look I put together.  I live in New England and I will be able to wear this dress throughout the year.  Summer evenings can get cool.  So, a lightweight, long sleeved dress is perfect for those cooler evenings.  In the winter, I can simply add a denim jacket or complimentary wrap for additional warmth.  I've been looking at this type of dress for months.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.  The dress is very well made.  Every seam is finished perfectly.  I rarely wear clothing that has an empire waist.  But, because the empire waist doesn't come all the way up to underneath my bust, I find that it looks very nice on me.  I will add pictures to this review after I have the dress hemmed.  I gave my measurements & height info to help you decide what size might work best for you.  If you've found my review to be helpful, I'd appreciate it if you would click the helpful button.  TYSM!!!


I'm 5'8", size 34G bust, and wear size 6 pants. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly! Touches the tops of my feet, arms are snug and comfy, top fits great. My only complaint is the elastic on the inside is incredibly itchy so I will likely wear a Cami underneath. Other than that, it's beautiful and comfy!


Bought this for family pictures and the quality is great - especially for the price. Material is soft and thick. Pockets are extra cute and I received quite a few compliments from strangers. Iâ€™m 5â€™4â€� and wore it with booties and it covered my shoes which I was fine with - It might be a bit long to wear with flats if youâ€™re 5â€™4â€� or under. Considering getting more colors!


This is exactly what I was hoping for.  Real comfortable and doesn't show the muffin top.  I ordered the red, just for the fun of it.  It's my "housedress", for the evenings when I want to look nice for my husband AND be comfortable.  I put it on the minute it arrived to see how the fit was.  I am 5'2" at 138 right now and the medium a perfect fit. Very long but I put a couple of big safety pins through the inside of the seams at the bottom to form a ruchette affect up the sides and that worked for now.


I hate shopping for clothes, particularly dresses. I love this dress. Itâ€™s somehar casual but fresh enough for church. The pockets make my day. The waistline is great for people like me who arenâ€™t overweight but have had a few kids and have that bit of a Mom belly that tends to make everything look awkward. This hides it well. It is really long... I refuse to wear heels, so I sometimes trip on it going up stairs (Iâ€™m 5â€™4) Iâ€™m 135 lbs and normally wear a size small sometimes a medium in shirts, and a size 4 rarely 6 in pants. I bought a size small and it fits perfectly. I wear a 32DDD and it fits fine in the chest. I wear a tank top under it so itâ€™s not too sheer in the chest though.


This dress looks adorable on! I am 5â€™10â€�, wear a size 12/14 bottoms, L-XL/ 36G top, and ordered an XL. The top is snug, but as it is a stretchy material it is not overly tight. The sleeves hit my wrist bone and are fitted throughout. The waist hits me like an empire waist (just below the boobs). The length of the dress hits me at my ankle (tall problems). Though itâ€™s shorter than Iâ€™d usually like, it still looks cute, especially with sandals.  Great flow to the dress and super soft. The pockets are large enough to put phone/keys, but obviously not super secure as itâ€™s a soft material.


Overall, very cute. I will be buying another in a 2X and will update then.
