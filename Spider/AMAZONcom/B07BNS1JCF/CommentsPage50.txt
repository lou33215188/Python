This dress surprised me, it looks so much better then I ever thought. Specially since i'm a plus size girl I Didn't think it would suit me that well and I honestly thought I was buying it to wear one time only. But no, I am going to use this dress a lot, I really love it, it feels so comfortable and at the same time, it looks so good!!! I love it so much! Can't wait to put it on again :)


Super comfy and cute, nice that it’s long enough for me ( I have long legs) I can even wear a little bit of a heal. Soft fabric and the pockets are great!! Wish I had one in every color!


Loved this for my daughter, but had too send back. The chest was too fitted for my liking on her.


Nice quality; especially for the price. The Jersey fabric is fairly heavy. will wash well.  And I love the pockets.


Very cute dress! I like how the skirt on it isn't too voluminous, like some other maxis can be. It doesn't give that "pregnant look", if you know what I mean. Very comfortable and looks great; I'm a professional orchestral musician and can dress this up and wear on stage and be comfy while I play. Win!


This dress is AMAZING. I am 5'2'' 145 Pounds and can wear with flats. I ordered a small - can't wait to wear it during the holidays


This dress fits wonderfully!!! I love it!! The material is good. I'm 5'8", 158 lbs and I purchased a medium. The dress is so long that it touches the floor.


I am not a dress person but let me tell you....this dress is BEYOND comfortable!  Fits perfect!  Very pleased!!


This dress is perfect! It's comfortable and fits just as pictured with the exception of the length. I was worried that it would be way too long, but it isn't. I'm 5'4", and it touches the floor but doesn't say. I love it!


This dress length was not at all what it was portrayed. I normally wear a Large in clothing, I am 5’6 and I got a XL just in case, it came in the mail and it was extremely too short. I mean very short. I am so unhappy with it.
