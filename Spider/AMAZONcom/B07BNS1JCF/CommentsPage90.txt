I love this dress. The only downside is the fabric is a little thin. So I had to wear a slip.


Comfortable, soft long dress is really nice! The size is true to the size chart.  The dress hangs neatly, and I like the pockets.


A bit long, but I was honestly expecting that. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the dress. It arrived well before the estimated time of arrival.


I love this dress! Makes me feel pretty and what more could you ask for. I'm 5'8, 160 and the large fit great. It wasn't long enough to wear heels but I didn't mind.


It is good, a little thin but certainly worth the price.  It is long enough for tall folks and the sleeves are long enough for long arms. Overall it is a good item.


perfect for maidmaid


Thin material. Worth the price.


Very poor quality material.


The fabric is so nice and light weight.  Perfect for spring/fall or even on those cool summer evenings.


Fit is amazing & it's super comfy! I'm 5'9 & just shy of 200lbs, and xl fit great. I'm so excited to wear this for a barn wedding
