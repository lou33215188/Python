Comfy fabric, but the snug long sleeves bothered me so I returned it.


I wanted something for winter with boots but  could wear with  flats in early spring  when its still cool.


This is now my favorite thing to wear!  Very flattering and so comfortable!!!


I bought this to wear as a concert dress in my college orchestra and it's amazing. I'm 5'10" and 165 lbs, and I got a large. I will definitely recommend this to my colleagues!


I love this dress. I’m 230 lbs and 5”8” and I purchased an XXL. Length grazes the floor and it has two sexy pockets. I’m definitely ordering some more for the summer. I paired mine with a great black belt for more definition and style.


Haha. It’s cute. But nothing like the image. No pockets. Comes to my elbow (sleeves) and my knees (overal length) and I’m only 5’6”.


Love this dress! Fits as expected! Very flattering! Love the pockets! I want one in every color!


The quality was decent considering the price. It looked exactly as it should, really soft material. Unfortunately I am big chested and the waist line sat right under my boobs rather than the waist. Returning for that reason, which sucks because I liked everything else about it.


This dress is so simple, yet very pretty. I ordered the navy & the accessories will be endless. Fits true to size, but the most amazing part for this 5'5" gal is it's not too long! I don't know how it's possible. I ordered a medium & fits great; and extremely comfortable!I haven't washed it yet, so that's the 4 star rating.


The black dress is not like the picture. It is actually a scoop neck instead of crew neck. Also, the elastic waist hits right under the boobs instead of the waist line like it shows. It's not flattering.
