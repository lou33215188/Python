Perhaps the style is not as flattering as I would like as an older woman, but the fabric is very soft and I will wear it as nightwear.


I Love the material.


This Tess is beautiful, however, the chest area is very small I would say it fits like an XL instead of a 2X. Everything else was perfect just small in the heat area.


Super comfy material.  Cute.


Love the dress and the fact that it has pockets. My only complaint is that the fabric is a bit thin.


Beautiful and fits perfectly.


5’3” , I ordered a small.


Love it! This is my third maxi dress from this seller and won't be my last!


I am 5 foot 2 and had to have it shortened. I bought a large and it fit perfect except for the length.


I did not expect to love this dress as much as I do! Its so comfortable and fits pretty good. What a Steal for only $20!


It runs a little small and a little sheer in the bodice, but overall a good dress and I love the royal blue color.
