I love this dress because of its soft material and casual nature. I weight around 80 kgs with 5.5 height and it’s large size fit me perfectly. Love the two pockets on the side!


I love this dress. I am 5’1, so it was a little long and had to hem it, but that was to be expected. Very comfortable.


The color is not accurate. I bought the burgundy color and it was bright red instead. The material is also very thin, it was sheer in places. I definitely could not wear it. The length of the skirt and slaves was perfect, but that's about it.


Love this dress & have gotten so many compliments on it!


I was expecting it to be a little longer, but I am 6'1.5 so it is still a good length.


The material is very nice and the color is true to what was shown online.


Great


This is seriously one of my all time favorite dresses and I even went ahead and ordered it in a couple other colors because I love it so much.

Lovely ordered another


(Excuse my messy guest room, I’m in the process of moving!) I’m 5”6’ and weigh around 220. I ordered an XL and it fits great! It’s SUPER comfortable and SUPER soft! Looks great with a necklace or scarf!
