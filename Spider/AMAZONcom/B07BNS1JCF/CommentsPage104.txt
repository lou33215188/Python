This dress is so comfortable, soft material and true to size. I had forgotten it had pockets and when I put it on I freaked because pockets are awesome. Want to get one in every color!


the fabric is almost see through and very thin. I bought this to wear at work. (I cut hair) but I feel like this fabric is going to collect hair too much. the skirt isn't as loose as I expected it to be. but its soft and breathable. thats good I guess. I'm 5'11 and a size 20-22 but a small bust. its very long and almost touches the floor and the sleeves sit comfortably at my wrist. the pockets are a good size. I'd recommend wearing a slip underneath.


Loves this dress! Perfect while pregnant and just as perfect after ❤️


Dress is good material, however if you are on the taller side, it will be above the ankle. I’m 5’7 and it’s right above my ankles.


Nice dress. My Wife Looks amazing in it.


This dress is beautiful. I am 5'10" and wish that it were 3-4" longer though.


Nice fit.  Very comfortable.

Love love love this fabric is so comfy!!!! Fit is great I wish the waist line was a little lower I have a large bust so I need just a little bit more space.
