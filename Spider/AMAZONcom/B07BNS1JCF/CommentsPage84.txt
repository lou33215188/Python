I love it


Cute & comfortable.  Love the pockets.


Definitely not what I expected! A waste of money! Do not recommend at all. It is see through and I am not big chested. I ordered a small and it's really big, and you can still see through it! Don't waste your money!


If you are on the fence about size, like S or M, pick M. Love it!


perfect for tafitti costume


This is my new favorite dress and I'm going to order a few more in different colors. It fits just right and he material is soft.


The dress was perfect as a maternity dress. At 33 weeks pregnant you need comfort and style. It was perfect. The material is high quality too.


The black is a little seethru.  You need to wear a slip


Love it!


Comfortable.  Fits good
