very cute,  a little long though and a little small in the arms and back.  I wear a medium so I should have gotten a large


The quality is fine for the price, and the color is great; but at 5'4" and 108lbs, I wouldn't really expect the elastic waistband on a size small to be so tight I can barely squeeze into it. I wear a size small or extra small in everything. I wore it around the house a little to see if I could get used to it, but unfortunately it's so tight it gives me a stomach ache. Will return.


I love this dress, the only issue I have with it is the band under the bust is itchy, I have to wear a tank top under.


Really cute and comfortable. Can be worn casual or dressed up. I’m 5’51/2 ft tall and it’s long which I love


this is my new fave. SOOOO comfy and pockets?!!! i am 5.7, 130lbs small bust and i ordered a medium


Should’ve purchased the large. It’s too tight on my busy, and is now see-through.


Beautiful. I’m 5 feet 7 and i bought it in a large. It’s true to size. It reaches my ankle. It doesn’t cover my feet like in the picture but it is a beautiful maxi dress


Great casual dress for my teacher/girlfriend. She loves it...mostly because it has pockets, but whatever.


I was very happy with this purchase!  I am 5'7" 135lbs, with measurements of 34C/26/36 and the size medium fit perfectly. I normally have issues with sleeve length and full length of maxi dresses but this dress just touched the floor and the sleeves sit about 1/2" below my wrist.  The dark green was a beautiful rich color that is not transparent.  Very happy with this dress.


This dress was a hit!  I received many compliments.  It was comfortable, too!
