I would size up. I usually wear an XL in dresses no matter what & I found this was very small & right on the arms & chest.


Fits great. I bought medium. Im 5'4 ..150.. This dress is very very flattering. Would buy again


There are a lot of pages with the same stock photo of this dress but looking through the reviews on the other pages I found that they were not good quality, this dress is amazing. Perfect. Great fit, good cotton fabric, and durable. I got a black one to wear to work as a nanny and it has held up! Considering buying one in every color!


Fits great! Flows nicely! So soft! No issues with fabric wearing or becoming rough. I received many compliments after pairing the brown with a gold scarf and cheetah pattern flats.


I just LOVE this dress!  It's super comfortable.  Yes, a little see through on the top (I wear an under top), but so, so comfy and nice!


Love this dress! Fits great, made well. Perfect jersey dress! I always get compliments when I wear it


The hem of this came out within an hour of me wearing it.


I bought this for my mom's funeral. It was perfect and comfy.


I just got this dress in the mail today! I’m 5’6” and 180 pounds, so I decided to order an XL to be sure it was the right length. It comes to the floor and looks great with heels. Soft fabric and pockets, which I love! I can’t wait to wear it!


First off this dress has POCKETS! I’m in love and just ordered two more. Super soft and just the right length, fabric is light enough to wear year round. Ordered dark green and it’s beautiful
