Love this dress! The material is great and it fits wonderfully! Good quality!


It was noted as running small so I’m glad that I got the larger size.  The length was perfect as it just hit the floor and I’m 5’5”.  This worked great as the start of a Halloween costume but I’d buy the dress to wear on a regular basis as well.


Love this dress!  Just had surgery and wanted something comfy and stylish!  Received many compliments from colleagues!  Will order in different colors!  Highly recommend!


I love this dress. I bought one of every color. It can be worn to work on a casual Friday with ankle boots and a scarf.


Very long and a bit thin but not thin enough to need more then just a slip


I bought this to wear for my maternity pictures & it was very comfortable and the material was so soft! It’s a great dress and very pretty!


Great buy


I'm 5'7" and the fit, including the length, was perfect. I'm going to order additional colors.


I am 5'8 the dress does not touch the ground, but around my ankles, I am ok with that...so comfortable. I wear a medium and bought a medium, fits perfect.


nice comfortable material
