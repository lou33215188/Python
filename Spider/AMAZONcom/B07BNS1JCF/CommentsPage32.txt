The only reason this dress does not get 5 stars is because the elastic in the waist is so uncomfortable.  I love everything else about this dress, but the elastic almost seems sharp, even though it's not too tight.


size runs a little smaller than expected - I ordered one size larger than I thought I would need as I wanted a looser fit - so while it fits it is not as loose as I would have liked - however it is a very comfortable dress.


This is my absolute favorite dress I have ever own. Itâ€™s the perfect fit for me, modest, and HAS POCKETS!!!! I am for sure going to be purchasing many more of these dresses in different colors/prints because of how much I love this item.


Ordered a large 5â€™7 (185lbs) fits nice! Very comfortable


i love this dress, i was on the fence about it after reading the reviews but im glad i did. I bought an XL and it fits perfectly. im 5â€�9, 38 D, 207 lbs.. i love the material and its length. im deff buying another


Fabric is a little thin, but I love that it has pockets, and itâ€™s very comfortable. Feels like wearing a nightgown.


Love this dress! I'm going to order additional colors. I dressed it up with a bootie and nice accessories but this can definitely be casual as well.


All I can say is that I â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�, this ğŸ‘— so much. I have one in black, royal blue, burgundy and a sage green. I wear them to church and I've gotten so many compliments in each ğŸ‘—. I'm 5'3 around 140-145 lbs and the length of the dress is a bit long but I love them because I wear then with heel ankle boots.


This dress is awesome! Super comfortable and can be dressed up or down. I typically wear a small or medium, size 4-6 in most pants, I am 5'6" and weigh 150 lb. I purchased this is a medium and it's perfect.


Great quality dress! I got this as a bridesmaids dress for a wedding I was in and it looked wonderful! Nice, rich color and such soft fabric! I was very impressed. I usually donâ€™t wear maxi dresses so I donâ€™t know how long they typically are but I am 5â€™1 and it was about 5-6â€� too long for me but that to be expected since length is usually a problem for me lol. The dress did fit a little bigger than I expected so if youâ€™re in between sizes I would go a size down
