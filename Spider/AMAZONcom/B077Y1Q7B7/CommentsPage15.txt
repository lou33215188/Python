My daughter is in Rainbow Girls and they need a white gown. The measurements were spot on. The dress is BEAUTIFUL on her. It fits her like a glove.


Longer than specified. It specifies 59" long, however, it's 62" long. I'm 5'7", 133 lbs., size 36B bra, and usually use a size 6 or 8. I ordered size 6 and it was a bit loose.


It is simple and elegant dress with real white. I am 5 7 and length was perfect with size 4. And it is padded enough so don't need to worry for sheer.


It runs small and zipper can be improved. Order one size up.


The color is true to the picture and size matches the size chart.  Overall well made. It was a tad long, I’m 5’2” and had to hem off 2 inches.  The other reviews were correct, a bra is not needed.


For the price, it's really well made! The seams and stitches are well-made, and the inside lining is nice and soft. The dress looks more expensive than it is!


I liked the goods. I'm happy with the purchase.


love the product would order again was just what i ordered


I love this dress. Looking for a dress for my daughter's wedding in July in our backyard, and this fit the bill. Extremely light and flowing. It is just slightly large on top and I am in the process of losing hopefully about 10 pounds, so will have to return for a six instead, although not in stock right now.  It is a beautiful pinkish coral, not overly bright and flattering.


A beautiful dress, but it just didn't work with my body type!


Actually was just too long; beautiful dress. I wish you had it in petite.
