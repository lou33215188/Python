180 lb  size 14 fits perfect. At first I ordered 16 but it was too big for me so I contacted the seller and she was very nice. She put away the size 14 for me until I was able to return the 16. I would recommend this dress.


I have ordered a total of 7 dresses to pick from, for my besties wedding, as Bridesmaid.  THIS IS THE ONE BY A LONG SHOT! The fit is amazing, the length perfect. Only had to adjust under side of arm hole.

This lovely gown reinvented chiffon for me. The look is classy, graceful and feminine. The fabric is elegant and of good quality. I can't use it at that length and am having it shortened to tea length and am looking forward to being very pretty.


Super cute and was awesome inexpensive.


Good bridesmaid dress! Fit as expected, and a wonderful color! Fit all of my differently shaped bridesmaids very well.


It was perfect, I did however, have to adjust the to(tack the back to fit the bust) only because my chest does not conform to "the usual" body type for my height and weight.


This dress is beautiful and worked perfect for my One Piece Vivi cosplay.


Beautiful dress...I'm 5'5'' and it's SUPER long. But, I expected that. I have to get it altered, but once it's done it will be gorgeous! Plus, the price makes it even better :)


Beautiful def buy! you won't be disappointed. Plus it way cheaper and better than David's bridal


bust is small
