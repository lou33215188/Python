poor quality


I really liked the dress, but it ran very long for a size 6.  Otherwise the quality was great and it was a beautiful dress.


Pretty dress, true to size. Like other reviewers said, it is delivered in plastic and is EXTREMELY wrinkled.


I don't know what I was expecting, but the picture here and what I received was not even close to the same thing. Returned!


Beautiful dress! I bought based on the bust size and it fit well. Had to use a hand steamer quite a while to get all the packaging wrinkles out, but other than that it was great.


Elegant and casual


I love Ever Pretty dresses, they're elegant and affordable, my third one.


Excellent goods Thanks for the seller


Fits great !


I love the fit!! It's such a flattering dress. The padding isn't the typical cheap flimsy padding found in most dresses; it is thick enough to feel comfortable without a bra and there is enough support for busty girls.


I can't wait to wear this to a wedding next weekend!!
