Great dress for a great price!!


it is ok


Fit is good, material is nice. Top part may need altered a little, it's just a tad big. Very happy.


Just as I expected.  Nice dress.  Size 4 is a perfect size 4.


Fit was what I hope for


Nice dress, a little small. Easy to wrinkle


Fits perfectly, but definitely made for women who have a larger bust size than a B. Love it, but disappointed with the extra fabric in the bust.


Great dress.  It is very flattering, and it does not need a bra.  Fit me perfectly.


Way too long and too small.


didn't like the quality of the material
