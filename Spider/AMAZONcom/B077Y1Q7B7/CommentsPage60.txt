It was very good


The dress fit was too loose, so we had to return it for a smaller size.  The second one fit better, but it was a misery to iron out all of the wrinkles.  I was hoping that after it was laundered it would not be so wrinkly, but it seems to be worse than before.  It will need to be ironed before wearing it again.  The color is beautiful, and she loved wearing it.  The plunge in the front and the back was more than we were expecting.


pretty but too big


Great quality


So happy with this dress!!


I really like this dress but unfortunately it was too small for me. I love how fast I got it and how easy it was to return!


The only problem with it is that the fabric between the boobs seemed a little crooked. I was kinda planning on getting it removed anyways though. Other than that it seemed like good quality to me!


I already ordered the next size up! And if the fabric between the boobs isn't crooked on this one I may keep it in there because I liked it way more than I expected.

I wore this dress to the Opera.  It was perfect and I received lots of compliments on it.  As others have mentioned, it did come with some wrinkles.  I purchased it several weeks before I needed it and hung it up right away.  I also hung it in the bathroom while I showered.  As a result, when the time came to wear it, the wrinkles were pretty much gone.  I'm very pleased with the dress, especially for the price.


I ordered size 4, lavender, because they don't make size 2.  My regular size is 2, and I'm 5'1", 115lbs. The size 4 of this dress was too small...


The quality is great. Very elegant and light dress. However the size of the under bust is too small. I couldn't close the zipper. The under bust size of this dress is 26", and mine is 27". The size chart shows waist size and now I know this is the size of under bust, not the belly area.


I would love this dress, but unfortunately have to return it. I rated lowest score so that people will review it more. But the dress is very pretty. I wish I could keep it..


I just received this dress today; fits as expected.  Really nice but not quite what I need for the Military Ball I bought it for.  Although it's long and fairly dressy, it's more of a nice evening out than a really formal Military Ball gown.  I'll wear it to our Christmas Party.
