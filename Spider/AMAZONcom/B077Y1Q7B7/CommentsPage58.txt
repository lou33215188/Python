Great dress. You will have to steam the wrinkles out but fits great!


Everything looks nice, but size too small, could not pull zipper.


It is the dress I dreamt of.


ran way too big


It was too short and a bit large, but beautiful.....wish it had worked


Perfect fit.  Looks great


Nice though somehow large


Exactly as pictured.


lovely dress and fit just right.


nice dress for wedding
