Beautiful bridemaids dress


Had to take it to a tailor to be altered.


I love it, expect a bit big on top.


I am a size 2 in jeans answer a size 3 fit perfectly.


Needed a special occasion dress for a black tie event and this looked amazing. Once I received it and tried it on, it was too big in the waist and back, and was painfully plain. Luckily, I still have time to continue my search for a special dress for this occasion. It is pretty, just not what I need for this event.


A Little Plain but OK.  With some accessories this can become really nice.


Love it!


Good fit and pretty.
