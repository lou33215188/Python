Love the dress - beautiful flow, just as nice as a more expensive gown! Not too long on a 5'3" frame, with 2 inch heels, the dress just sweeps the floor and the dress is correctly proportioned nothing too small or too big. It is a nice design and fits very well.


Good


It was a little too big for my baby girl however Id rather have it too big than to small I can get it taken in but overall it was a beautiful buy looks wonderful on her


I loved the dress, but I needed to have a bigger bust to make it fit. I am a 36C and to have it fit properly I would need to be 36E. I ordered a size 16.


Got a size bigger than I thought I'd need and had the shoulders taken in. The liner seemed fairly cheap but the overall look was really nice. I wore this dress to my cousin's black tie wedding.


Very nice for the price! Really shocked at the quality for the price.


pretty dress


Beautiful dress! Fits well, but was extraordinarily long!


This gown fits like it was made just for me!


Fit perfectly, not to snug which I prefer.  Love the cute cut on the front.  Doesn't cling to my curves :)
