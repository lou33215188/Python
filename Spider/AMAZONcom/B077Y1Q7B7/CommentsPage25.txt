very nice dress but I ended up choosing a different one after all. Size 8 fit just fine and length fit fine too...


5'1  128  size 8.  It is soft but sheer.


I gave it away to someone who could use it., Size ran to big.


Beautiful dress, couldnâ€™t expect more.


Wore this dress to a wedding and it was perfect. The dress is very comfortable yet flattering. It was easy to dance in, photographed well, and camouflaged my baby weight nicely (nursing moms, it was easy to pull down the strap to nurse too). I can't believe what a nice dress it was for the price.


The dress itself is beautiful I ordered a size up like people had suggested but it was still way too small in the bust. Ended up having to order twice my normal size to get it to fit and I am not big chested


The dress fit around the waist good but in the shoulders it fit loose, it was loose enough that the straps fell off the shoulders.


Generally flattering, but much too low cut on me - it showed off 6+ inches of cleavage! I ended up returning it and choosing a different dress for my bridesmaids


i will have to return this item. didn't even try it on. it had wear stains on it under the arms and around the hem.


On the brust was too big, took it to tailor for alter.


Couldn't zip past my ribs.
