Got a size 6. I'm 5'5" and 150 lbs. I'm a 34D and the size six fit everywhere except around the rib cage under the hat area.


Very pretty. The top was large and laid somewhat funny on me, but I am very pear shaped. It Was shipped quickly and customer service was EXCELLENT.


It's an amazing dress my daughter looks very beautiful in it, I highly recommend it


Daughter loves this dress


The color and got was perfect it was extremely wrinkly when we received it but I just steamed it and it came right out love love love it


Pretty dress,I love this.


I bought this dress for one of my bridesmaids, and I was skeptical at first about ordering a dress from a company I've never used before but couldn't afford to spend $150 at Davidâ€™s bridal. This dress has gone beyond my expectations. I am so in love with it, and I know my bridesmaid will be too.


I wore this for my stepdaughter's wedding. It's very flattering and comfortable. I had to have it taken up in the shoulders, but this is a common occurrence for me.


Very pretty but extremely long.  Also chest is Cut small and band it's high.  Feels like whole top of dress was not in proportion to bottom.  Had to return item.


This is a keeper. The knit underlay with the feather-light overlay sheds wrinkles like a dream. It's going in my suitcase for cruise formal nights. It's easy to dress up with a statement necklace and pretty shawl.  I'm 5'8", 190 pounds, and this is long enough to wear 2 and a half inch heels. It doesn't gape under the arms. The waistline rucking adds interest. The back is low, so be aware that a standard bra will show. The V-neckline has a modesty panel that I like.
