Beautiful dress just fit too big on top.


Simple, elegant, and the right price. The navy color is a little lighter than shown, I thought, but still formal and not "prom" or "bridesmaid" color. The zipper gets stuck; expect to have someone zip you up.


It might be a bit large in the bust for some. It works without a bra and the back is a little low-cut to wear a bra anyways. It was just the right length to allow dancing for me - 5'4" with mid-height heels.


The dress is perfect!! the color is the same as the photograph and the quality was great! for the outstanding price i highly recommend!


Was too long do my short height, but that can be fixed. Otherwise it is a gorgeous gown.


If you're going to purchase this, it's a good idea to order the next size larger.


The only issue I have is that it's a little shorter than I expected. But all my bridesmaids are in live with it so I'm happy!!


BEAUTIFUL dress. I'm a 34DD and was worried about the girls coming out too much, but the sheer conservative band in the middle of the v neck was both elegant and classy without looking stuffy or weird. It was sheer enough to know it's different than the straps, but not so sheer that you could see the cleavage through it. The back comes down further than a bra would, however I would feel comfortable wearing this dress without a bra since it has built in padding. The arm holes are a little low, but again, without a bra it doesn't matter.


I really love my dress.  I purchased it to wear to an all white party.


I have to return it. It's too big. But I love the dress.


A very lovely dress, however fit a little small for me
