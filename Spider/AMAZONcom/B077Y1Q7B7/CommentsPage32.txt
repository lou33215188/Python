Good look for the cost. Bust is a bit smaller than I expected it to be. Packaging is terrible comes rolled up in a plastic envelope/bag. Open quickly to fight the wrinkles


I bought a 4, she usually wears a two. The four was tight around the bust I reordered a six. It was too late to get a refund on the four. I now have two dresses! Hopefully the six isn't too big.


Good for price.  Only need to hem.. matched picture


Had to pin it up a bit.


I really love this dress for the price and style


I will post a picture later


Attractive dress but purchased this one in case size 10 didn't fit. Ended up returning both for another dress.


Fit was accurately described, however the wrong dress was delivered. I received a sleeved dress instead of the sleeveless one pictured.


Very cheaply made for the price of the dress.  The wrinkles would not be loosened after many attempts.


Based on the size chart, I ordered what I thought would be a size smaller, but it fits me now. I may end up trading for a 6.


A lovely, very well-made dress. I ordered purple and it was gorgeous. For anyone looking for size reference the bust of size 14 was slightly too large for  36D chest. Everywhere else it was nice and flattering. It was also a little too long but nothing that can't be pulled off with high heels. Or if you are tall it won't even matter.


The bust  issue could have been fixed by professional help but I ordered it last minute for a wedding, and there was no time. If there were any quick fixes, or built in adjustments I'd go with this dress. Unfortunately there were none. I went with plan B and this dress is going back. If you have the time, or skill, go for it. It was easy to return.
