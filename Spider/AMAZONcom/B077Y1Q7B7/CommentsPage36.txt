too small on the bust


Too small otherwise a nice dress.


Worked great!!


I was surprised with the good quality of the product. The green color is darker than the one shown in the picture, but still pretty.


Can't beat the price!


was not flattering on my body.


This dress was a last minute replacement for a High School Broadway show!  Fast delivery - quality dress - fit as expected and most important the price was wonderful!!!!


Dress was nice, but was too short! I am 5'6", and the dress didn't quite touch the ground when I was barefoot. With shoes it looked ridiculous, and my shoes only had 3 inch heels.


Fit me perfectly! Follow the size chart and you shouldn't go wrong


A little large in the bust and kind of long but overall a good buy.
