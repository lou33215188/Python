Beautifull and perfect


Size was accurate


I like a lot


The dress is beautiful! I love everything about it but the size 4 is more like a size 2  I am heartbroken having to return it.


Shorter than expected. The torso is slightly shorter in placement than I would have imagined from the pictures.


Beautiful dress.  The fit was a little loose.  Will need to send it back.


Great dress, great price, and wonderful quality! Definitely the way to go!!


Simple but elegant. I love the look. Fits perfectly. No adjustments needed so far.


I really like the dress. Material is super soft amd it looks elagant.


Just to big.
