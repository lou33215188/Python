Excellent ....i bought it for my maternity photoshoot...its really worth the money...i would recommend to buy...ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�ğŸ‘�


This dress was of great quality. I wish it came in a few larger sizes


Color and length were juat what I was looking for


It's a beautiful gown.  Slightly low in front for me.  But lovely


Nice dress for the price. I'm very happy with the purchase.


Nice and comfortable fit.


It is a little darker than the photos, so I'll be "orangier" than the other bridesmaids, but I still like it.


fit perfect, thank you


Pretty dress, made good for the price


go by your BUST SIZE ALL THE WAY - if your waist lies in size 8 but your bust is a 4/6 (Small), then get the 4 or 6.


I ordered this dress to see the fit and quality and determine if I want to use it as a bridesmaid dress in my upcoming wedding. I am 5'6" 34-28-36 and usually wear a 4 in dresses. I ordered a 4 and it fits very well. If anything I'd say its a little snug under the bust but w/ the built in bra I'm not concerned about it. The length just barely hits the ground so would be good w/ flats but would be a little short for anything else. I'd say if you're taller than 5'6" this may be too short for you. Overall though the fit is good and the quality is the same as what you'd get at a chain bridal shop but for a MUCH better price. I will definitely be asking my other bridesmaids (who are all 5'4") to buy this dress.


This dress is fabulous for the price, and it looks just like the picture. I wear an American size 2 or 4, and the English 6 was unavailable at the time, so I ordered the 4. It showed up four days sooner than scheduled, and it fits great. The bodice with built-in bra flatters my broad shoulders and flat chest, and I can lean forward without exposing myself. It's even the right length for me with 4" heels (I'm 5' 4").


The fabric has a nice drape. Both the sheer top layer and lining are soft and stretchy. I'm really looking forward to wearing this dress to my daughter's wedding -- after the ceremony and pictures, I'm going to tie a knot in the skirt, slip on some flats, and dance!


Simple dress for my daughters 8th grade cotillion. It was a little big on her, so we pinned it and she wore a camisole because it's cut really low. Overall, nice. Only complaint was that it came practically shrink wrapped into the bag and had so many wrinkles
