Very nice and well made dress, but the bust area was way too big for my size.


Beautiful but was too long for me.


Nice dress


Aside from being able to see through the skirt in the sun light, it is a nice dress. A slip will be required. Light weight, nice color and decent quality.


I am 5'3 and weigh about 145 lbs. I got a size 8 and it fit perfectly! It was very long and had to be hemmed, but other than that, I was extremely happy w/ this dress and got a lot of compliments.


Beautiful dress, just wasn't the style we were looking for. Easy return and refund.


I am 5"4 and ordered a size 6....even with my highest heels I needed to have it taken up about 2 inches. It is a beautiful dress but a little large in the armholes but overall worth the money.


Dress was beautiful, and has a lovely fit on top, but is incredibly long. I ended up returning it because I didn't have sufficient time to get it altered for the event I was attending, but it was a lovely gown.


Came quickly was affordable and was exactly what I was looking for! It is absolutely beautiful!!!


Thanks to all the women who posted reviews!!! I bought the peach in size 14. I don't look very busty, but I'm a 34G, smaller in the middle, with hips and butt for days! I am 5'6", 215 lbs and the dress is at least 2" on the floor. MUST wear hills to prevent dragging. The empire waist is supportive and the dress flows like a dream. You will feel lovely in this dress.
