Runs in a large size.


Pretty dress but the v-insert at the bust does not hang nicely. Returned.


A pretty dress but somewhat too large for me, will be sending it back.

Beautiful! Would buy again, wore to a friend's formal party.


I will need to return this dress since it is just too big....


I was actually  worried about the fit but it fits very well and the material  doesn't look cheap at all
