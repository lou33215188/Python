The dress overall was pretty but it was very short - I'm only 5'6 and it didn't even come to my toes. If you're tall, beware.


It was really very large and I gave it to my friend who is 4 sizes larger and it fit her very nicely.


I am not very good at ordering through the internet.


The dress was beautiful.


Thank you for contacting me.


I was pleasantly surprised! Fit as expected per the size chart and was in very good shape... Quality is great and will only need a dry clean and perhaps a hem prior to the wedding!


Beautiful color, cut, and fit. Very happy!


my wife looked beautiful in this dress at the Ball. The fit was great and afforded her the space to have dinner without crushing her insides like my friends date.


I cant return it even though its too small for me...and they didnt return my money..this is the worst..


buy a 2size bigger


Nice dress, however, sizes run small in the breast area ( I usually wear an 8 and will need to get a 12) so I have to send this one back for a bigger size.


I wore this to a really formal evening wedding and it was great.


The dress was very nice but my wife is Asian was too big for her
