Somewhat small I am larger busted than most women. So it fit me a bit uncomfortable and you need to waer tall shoes with this dress or you will trip over it.Don't get me wrong though I really lije the dress it was just snug for me.


I needed a formal black dress for an upcoming event, but was having a hard time finding one on a budget. Finding this dress was a total win, love the quality and fit. It has such a flattering shape and I didn't have to overpay. I am typically a size 6 but ended up exchanging for a size 8 because the bust of the 6 was too small. If you have a larger chest I would recommend sizing up. The padding in the dress is also nice because it eliminates having to find a bra that does not show. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.


Fit well, nicely made just wrong for the occasion.


Used it for a wedding the best dress ever... For the price it fit exactly the way it should i loved it !


color is great, fabric is ok- good for pictures.  just note- arrives folded and creased.  very hard to get the wrinkles out.


Excellent quality - extremely impressed!


My mom loves it


Plenty of room from the waist down, yet much too small in the bust. Not sure what sort of figure this was designed to fit.


love love love this dress. Simple yet elegent. Fit perfectly and was so comfortable! I didn't even need to wear a bra under it because there was enough support. I hated to take it off!


Definitely too small in the chest area. If you have C's I would recommend the next size up.
