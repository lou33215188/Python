It's gorgeous on.


A little bit larger than expectet


Gorgeous dress I love it just wish it fit a little better


Beautiful dress


I like the gown, but the bust area was a little big.  Not too big where I couldn't wear it, but it was loose.  It would have been perfect had it been a little tighter in that area.  The gown is plain but can be very elegant with the right jewelry.  It worked for my occasion as a hostess at a ball.


Great dress for the money!


Me gusto mucho


It is beautiful and fit perfectly


Was too tight around arm holes, no underlying structure to help with support. Buy a size large and tailor down.


I had to order a size too big but it still did me justice. Lovely and it hit the ground just right.
