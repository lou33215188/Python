Buying a prom dress online can be iffy, but this one fits perfectly, looks great, and arrived quickly.


I am only 5'4, the dress is too long even with a 4 inches heel. Buy it if you have at least 34 on your boob. It's too long and too big for me.


Flattering, sexy and elegant.  I am 5'4" with a 42D bust and bought a size 16 which fit like a glove and really hid my tummy.  Many compliments!


You will have to carefully iron since it comes very wrinkled and steaming alone didn't work.  Iron bottom layer separately then the top layer and it works better.


Bought this to wear to an upcoming wedding and tried it on already. It's absolutely beautiful, color (bought the purple) was just right, not too bright and not too dull, and it is ever so slightly on the large side, but can be adjusted. Very happy with the purchase and will buy from Ever Pretty again.


Very pretty, with a flattering fit. It has just a tiny bit of cleavage, but is not too immodest for a dressy event. It's lined with a built-in bra. At first glance, it appears to be very well made, however, looking closer, the quality of sewing matches closer to the low price. This won't be a dress that holds up to years and years of wear, but that's hardly ever expected of a dress like this. It'll be a nice bridesmaid or special occasion dress.


Great dress for the price


Beautiful dress. I feel elegant and sexy in it.


Love the way it fits and feels


My Maid of Honor and two other bridesmaids wore this dress in my wedding. (I let them choose among this and two other dresses made by Ever Pretty.) They were beautiful! The color was exactly what I was looking for - a deep, forest green. The fabric was high quality, not too lightweight or sheer. A great value for the price!


I ordered a size up to be safe and it fit perfectly, so it runs small. Aside from that, everything else was good.
