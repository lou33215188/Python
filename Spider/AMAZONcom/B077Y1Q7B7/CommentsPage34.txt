This dress is really pretty! I have never purchased a dress like this online before but based on the look and the reviews I thought it was worth a shot. I am definitely pleased with what I received. I can agree with others who posted about the dress being really wrinkled upon arrival. It was folded in a small shipping package so it was inevitable. I think the material will loosen up though or I will be able to get the wrinkles out.


I ordered a US size 14 based on my measurements. The legnth was great. The bust was a little bit big. I have ordered a size down to see if that will help. Either way I know I'll be happy with this dress!


Beautiful dress, great color and feel; however, the 4 was too large for me. I wish it came in a 2!


Beautiful dress, good fit at the top but a few inches too long. Going to get it hemmed. Gorgeous color!


I orderred this dress formy mother. She usually wears a size 10 and it fit perfectly! The dress was for a wedding and it looked gorgeous on her!


It's a pretty color and flattering fit. Gonna look for some accessories to jazz it up for a fall wedding.


I read the reviews on it being very wrinkled upon delivery. I had the same situation and tried hard to remove them.  I FINALLY had success with a Conair clothes steamer.  It worked perfectly. So if you have a steamer- No problem. If you don't - I wouldn't buy it.


so beautiful I feel young again.  Tight in rib cage but so elegant.  adding abit more fabric for modesty front and back still looks beautiful.


The dress was fine but I think the brand should have in mind have sizes for people tha hight are 5.0 , the dress was way to long from the weist to the shoulder.


This dress was in-between sizes for me on the larger side. It was very beautiful, though, and I would have kept it for the fact it was not the right fit. It appeared to be a good quality.


Fantastic dress!  Easy to step in and attend an event.
