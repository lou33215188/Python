Beautiful dress. I had to go down two sizes from their size chart to get a proper fit, but it was worth the back and forth.


Absolutely great craftsmanship. The dress is beautiful and the fit is great. Only issue is I don't know how to get the wrinkles out from the way it was packaged


Bought the smaller of my typical sizes, could not quite zipper.  It also looked like a night gown and not very flattering.  Was not a fan.


Beautiful


It was very pretty just too big. I had read the reviews which suggested it ran small and ordered larger than I should. Bummer. It really is nice for the cost.


Very very long......


Good fabric and tailoring quality.


I love the dress. It looks like the picture. A clasic and perfect  fit


The size is small


Just a touch large around the chest but otherwise a lovely dress for the price.
