I tried on the dress and it fits like a glove! I purchased the purple one. I will wear it to my cousin's wedding in two weeks.


Perfect right out of the bag.


only had to hem and take up the shoulders a little - beautiful dress!


little tight under the breast.


Better than i thought! I was very positively surprised.


Fabric has lots of wrinkles though, needs good iron to deal with that.


the color and style was what I expected. But the size I ordered was too large for me. I went by what some of the reviews had put down about it running small and ended up with the size too big. otherwise it was a perfect dress for the Masquerade Ball I went to.


Dress was to tight under arm area and around the breast area for me..


The front of the dress has a very low cleavage area


Great price & very pretty dress:)


My daughter loves her dress


It's as everyone said it's long I am 5'3 have to get it Hem. But still worth the money and you do have to steam it .the material feel so good on your skin.


I've got a pear shaped body.  Minimal breasts, wide hips, poofy, lumpy "mom" tummy.  This dress fits me PERFECTLY and conceals everything I wish hidden.  I love this dress.  The black I purchased just because every woman needs an "LBD".  Now I've ordered the SAME DRESS in green for my son's wedding.  It's hard to find something fashionable that isn't made for 17 year old bodies or 71 year old bodies.  This dress is just right for ME.  I'm 5 foot 6 inches and weigh 145.  The size 6 fits just right and just skims the floor if I wear flats.  The zipper has been criticized, but it has not yet been an issue for me.  Probably will sew over the seams to reinforce just in case...  The fabric wrinkles some have complained about left behind from tight packaging are, admittedly, there, even after a hand wash and hang to dry.  Maybe a good steaming?  There is no need for a bra if you are a "B" or smaller.
