This dress is absolutely gorgeous. The triangle between the chest actually acts as a push up bra a little. The chest also has padding so no need for a bra either. The shoulder straps are a little short for my tastes but again that acts as a push up bra again. Overall I absolutely love it. Sorry for the dirty mirror in the picture! I bought a size 6 am 5'6" 155 lbs, 34D, and 28" waist.


I really want to leave a glowing review for this dress. It arrived quickly, fit just how I was hoping, and it feels well made (except for the zipper, see below for details). However, whatever they did to this dress in the packaging process has left it permanently creased, and not in a nice, organized pleated-type way. The outer material has been crushed into a mess, and I can't get it smooth! I've never had a problem with creasing to this degree before, and I'm stuck. I shower-steamed it, ironed it, hand washed it, as per garment instructions, and even used the hotel garment steamer...nothing works. I did not have enough time to get it to a dry cleaner, which will be my last resort. So, minus two stars from what would have been a five star review.


  The dress is polyester. The drape of the skirt is flowy, and the bodice is fitted, but not too tight. I am 5'7" and the length is just right with a modest-height heel. I weight about 165, bra size 36 D, and I ordered the 14. I've always had broad shoulders and a fairly straight shape, which has made it rather difficult as I've put on weight to find dresses that work...this one fits quite nicely. It has a built-in bra, and a "modesty panel" at the crux of the "V." The zipper is not great, you really have to be vigilant when you zip (or have a helper do it!) to avoid zipping the fabric into the zip...not impossible, but probably could have been prevented with a better quality zip.


  I bought this dress for orchestra performances, and had it not arrived permanently creased, it would be exactly what I'm looking for...now that I've washed it, I'm stuck with it. I hope this review will influence the future product packaging, as this could be a terrific addition to many wardrobes...at a good price. I will update this review if dry cleaning works... hope this helps!


Size 10 / 5'6 and fit was perfect. Wore dress to an outdoor wedding in FL and it was cool and comfy. Received tons of compliments.


Awesome gown for my big day!! I could've went down a size but, was afraid it would be to small and time was s factor. If you wear a 12 buy a size 12 ğŸ˜Š


Lovely dress. Fits just right! I'm a size 10 and it fit wonderfully.


I don't typically order dresses online but I was in a pinch for a wedding we had to attend. Before my purchase, I measured my body dimensions and compared them to the size chart and ordered from there. It worked out quite well!!


When I dress arrived, it had several wrinkles due to the packaging but I wasn't expecting it not to have wrinkles. I let the dress hang in the bathroom with hot water running in the shower. I came in after 10 minutes and smoothed out the dress. It took about 30 minutes of this and using the hairdryer on it for them to come out.


In the end, my dress turned out gorgeous and we had a fantastic evening!


Ok so this dress is really pretty and well made  and perfect for summer/spring weather it's very light and flowing. I'm 5'3" and 34 ibs and the size 8 fit me perfect under the breasts which is 30" and size 36 B the arm holes are about 1/2 inch too big but could be taken in if you know how to sew my arm hole measures 13" so  The armhole of this dress measures 14" the length is way to long for me even with heals exactly 60" long  so the dress is not for short people LOL Unless of course once again you know how to sew but unfortunately for me it's going back.  This dress is made to wear without a bra and does so very graciously fits me just fine in that area it's padded and acts as a little bit like push-up bra  definitely accentuated that area I really love this dress and wish it was shorter.


This dress far exceeded my expectations. It fit perfectly, and I typically have issues fitting into dresses because of my bust.  I received so many compliments, and everyone was shocked to hear that this wasn't super expensive.  I would buy again in a heartbeat, and in fact may buy in another color.  I love it.


I was very impressed with the quality of the dress.  Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size.  Order according to your bust size.  Unbelievable quality for the price.


Beautiful dress and a great price! Fit me perfectly and was very comfortable.
