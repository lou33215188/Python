It's a bit large but I can adjust it myself.  Materials are nice. Great price. And looks just like on the pic.


Perfect fit. Follow size chart for bust line. Pink dress is a little sheer even with two layers.


I really like the dress just a little long


Nice color good material and fit perfect


Pretty dress


Beautiful dress. I will wear to Captain's Night on my cruise.


Didn't fit exactly right.


First time ordering cloths on line fits pretty good.


Dress was beautiful and seemed high quality but I had to return it because it was too large. I even took my measurements before purchasing.


fits great. Plan to wear this at a military ball and it's perfect for this occasion.
