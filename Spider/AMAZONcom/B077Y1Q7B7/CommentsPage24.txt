It was almost perfect. It was way too long. It fit perfectly everywhere but in length. I'm 5'3" but I'm mostly legs so when I measured from my hip to see how long it would be I measured from MY hip not where a dress would hit me on the hip.


Thankfully this was too small or my daughter would have worn it and practically matched the bridesmaids dresses that they paid $200 a piece for!! .I'm not sure that the dress will hold up for multiple wears but perfect for a wedding or charity event.


I am 5'2" and this dress is a little to long.  Simply and elegant !


The dress is nice. But too large. I had to give it away


Used these dresses for the maid of honor and bridesmaids at my daughters wedding. Some of them had to be hemmed, but that was to be expected. Ladies with really heavy chest (DD) will have a problem and may need to order bigger size.


It arrived in a timely manner. The material is great. Very comfortable! Only issue is that the chest area and straps are too big. The waist fits me fine. I will have to get it altered, but I wore it once for a cruise and it was perfect :)


Fits perfect and is well suited for large chested women.


La talla es m√°s chica que la stadar.


Length too needs to be tailored... I wish it was floor length..


Material was strange and looked like night wear!
