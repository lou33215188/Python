Un poco grandecito.


Product is nothing like the pictures show in the ad.


Very nice


I ordered the dress in my size but it runs a bit large in the bust/back area, so I returned it and ordered it in a smaller size because the dress is really beautiful.


Beautiful dress great fit for the price. Very happy with purchase


This dress is a great value! I can't believe it!


Not the right design came as a strapless dress.


Love the way it looks on. Just need to get it hemmed, a problem I always have. Wearing it on a cruise in October.


Love this dress fit true to size


Dress was beautiful and nicely made but another comment said to go a size up and it was definitely too big
