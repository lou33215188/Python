I had to return the item. It runs small.  I did love the color.


Lovely dress.  Well made and good value.


Received wrong dress.... I ordered the one on second photo


I purchesed this item for my senior year homecoming. It arrived on time and fit PERFECTLY when I tried it on. I would definitely recommend this dress.


Was too small, had to order the larger size but then it was too big on the shoulders and feel down.  The quality was nice.


returning it.  the bottom of the zipper does not lay flat, looks horrible!  The material is very cheap looking.  Will not be purchasing this brand in the future...very disappointed.


Not happy with this dress. Looked nothing like the picture. More like a bridesmaid dress. Fit not true to size. Returning item.


Runs small, should have fit according to sizing chart it but to tight couldn't quite zip all the way up.


Although it need some alterations, I was happy with this dress and it looked great for my event!


Love this dress!! Beautiful color and it fits perfect! Totally recommend it!!
