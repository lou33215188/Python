The dress is beautiful, yet I wish it came in a bigger size. I purchased it for a wedding, so hopefully I can lose weight so it fits.


Material & dress is good.  But does run a lil small.


Pretty dress for the price. Runs a little big. Very wrinkled, extremely difficult to get the wrinkles out. Still wrinkled after working on it with a steamer for an hour. My arms hurt so I gave up. Update: I was able to get tge wrinkles out by placing a damp white towel on top of the dress as I ironed it on a low setting . Be careful not to let the iron touch the delicate fabric. I don't know for sure if the fabric would burn or melt but I wouldn't take tge chance.


Beautiful but if you are 5'5.....bad choice


Beautiful gown. Wore it to a gallery opening, got many complements on it. Can be worn in summer months or in winter with the right accessories.


Bought this for a wedding, and was extremely disappointed to have it not fit.  Beautiful color, and quality though.


My sister used this as a bridesmaid dress due my wedding. It was gorgeous!


Very pretty color. It is see through so purchase a slip.


Too low cut in front and back. Beautiful dress though. I returned it


I wore this as my wedding dress for a city hall wedding.  It fit perfectly, enough support to not wear a bra (I'm a C cup), absolutely no complaints.  It did com wrinkled, but ironed out fine, not sure what others did.
