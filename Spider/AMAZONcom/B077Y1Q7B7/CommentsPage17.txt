the dress fit well, but the material and lining was not quite what I had in mind for my bridesmaids' dresses. And because of my busy wedding planning, was not able to return the dress within the timeframe. However, the seller understood my situation and was very accommodating in working out a special refund process for me!!!  That's why I am giving them 5 stars! Love their customer service! Thanks, Rosemarie!


Make sure to look at the size fitting chart to make sure you get the correct size. Lovely dress, great comfortable material!


Was exactly what I was looking for. Better than the dress that I spent $200 on.


beautiful fit and a great price!!


The color. I really can't believe how they sent it to me the dress was very wrinkle it was  sent  in a bag very poor tastes.


This is a gorgeous dress and a great value for the price.  It is very flattering and will be perfect for my husband's upcoming gala and a wedding we have to attend.  I would love to have more than one color in this style.  lovely dress


would buy again. came fast and fit perfect.


It was way to large and looked hideous on me!


Lovely dress for a great price!! I bought this dress for my daughter. Shes 5'3" about 120 lbs. At Davids Bridal they sized her as a size 2. We measured her ourselves and she was a size 6 for this dress' size chart. We bought the size 6 and it fits perfectly. It is really long as noted (60") so we  will need to get altered. Havent tried to get the wrinkles out yet. Super fast shipping.


I ordered a 16 in this dress and it fit fantastic! It is deffinitely very long- I had to take off 4in to wear sandals. But it was very form flattering. The built in bra was great, even with 38D's.
