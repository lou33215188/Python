I love it!! It's totally as published.


I was nervous about buying clothes on line, this dress fit perfectly!!!!


The dress looks and fits as pictured.  I wore this to a black tie wedding and was happy with the quality and appearance (especially for the price).


Very nice fabric and color. Runs smaller than size guide suggests in the waist. Also, very high waisted with waist part partially on chest area.


Ok


I was very  surprised with the quality and service.  It arrived faster than expected.  And it is a beautiful fit.  I will recommend your company.


Great fit, but it's too long.


Way too long. Beautiful color but will need to return.


The dress is soft....but  the measurements are not accurate. Worse, returns are not allowed.


Pretty dress but too small.
