Beautiful dress


The boobs are not where they are supposed to be. Unless you have a monstrous push up bra.


Minor adjustments, otherwise great dress


This runs slightly smaller than expected


Alterations needed to be done to get a decent fit.


I want it for baby shower, but it didn't work..no stretch:(


So beautiful I love it


Loved the dress!


You might need to order 1 size bigger


Beautiful dress! Used it for a wedding but for chesty ladies fit a bit small ;)
