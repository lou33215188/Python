I LOVE the dress, color and it is SEXY!!!❤️


I love the dress it's beautiful but it was too big for me I couldn't even wear it I had to give it away


Perfect dress but I can't wear it because it's too big. Definitely order a size down.


I love it! The material is great just as it is pictured although it's big I wear size 12 and I order 16


Hate it the threading was off I'm so devestated SMH


Loved the dress. 5’8 236lb 43,38,52 inches got a 2x


I'm buying the other colors too!


I wear a size 14 and order a XL. The dress fits perfectly!


As described its a beautiful dress. Fits perfectly.


Love it! so beautiful@
