Dress is BEAUTIFUL!!!! Get it ladies you wonâ€™t regret it!


wore this for my graduation and it fit perfect ! its soft, stretchy, thick material, and looks exactly like the picture


Overall decent but the material is definitely different from what you'd expect base on the photo displayed.


Love this dress. Fits great!


Oddly shaped bust. Copy not as expected


Not as rich as photo looked slightly purplish.


horrible zipper


The dress is beautiful and good quality, but I don't like the exposed silver zipper.  I'm 54 130 lbs and ordered a medium.


loved it


I got a xl it was PERFECT.  Got LOTS of complements.


I love it
