Dress fits well, but the zipper isnâ€™t the best quality. Bought the dress for a December wedding. Might wear the sleeves up instead of off the shoulder.


This dress is VERY low and does not stay up. I will say it looked great tho for about a minute until it fell down.


I love this!! Order a size down!! It's supposed to fit like a glove and runs a bit big!! I received compliments allll night!! No one believed I got this from Amazon


This dress was amazing. The only thing I wish is that it had a little more support in the breast area. I am very busty and the design mad it a little hard to wear a bra I received a lot of compliments at my brothers wedding. I'd recommend this dress.


Sizing is off, top section is somewhat large and bottom section is somewhat small.


the boobs section fell to much and is cheaply made right around that part, I am bigger in the area but dress was made that poorly that it wouldnt hold up right..it was cute for the night. Probably wont wear it again,. It was for Fantasia's concert where she didnt even sing the song i wanted to hear :(


I liked it but it was way bigger than expected.  I have to return it and when I went to reorder the price jumped up.


I was looking for a dress that I could wear on multiple occasions. This dress was perfect. I can pull the sleeves up, wear one sleeve up and the other down or both down. The only problem I had with it is that it's kinda "long" on me. I'm 4'11" and it was almost to my ankles. I had to get it altered but still love the dress


This  dress literally gives me life! Not cheap material at all and fits perfect! Thank you so much I will definitely be ordering another in a different color!


I wear XL and am 5'4 and this dress fit true to size and its a nice thick material, definitely worth the purchase!
