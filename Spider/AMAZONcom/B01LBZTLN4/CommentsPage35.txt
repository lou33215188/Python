I ordered a large and I’m 5’0 and thick and curvy and it hugged me and fit wonderful , the material was amazing for the price and it wasn’t see through at all


Nice fabric but was entirely too snug across the bust area so I had to send it back. Not a good dress if you are busty but otherwise ok.


Extremely disappointed. The dress finish looks cheap, fits poorly and isn't as attractive as advertised. I Would return it but it costs too much to ship so it's not worth the money or the effort.


I ordered this dress in white, but its more of a very light purple.  The top part is very stiff and hard to get on.


The dress is very nice, tight fit to enhance and hug your curvesThe material is stretchy. The zipper gets stuck a bit but it doesn't feel cheap so, that's a plus. The breast area has a weird wire support - without the perfect breast support it will make your breast look flat. Overall the dress is beautiful.


LOVE! The fit, shape color. I got so many compliments and people remarked it look as tho I had spent much more than I did once I told them I got it from amazon. A great dress!


The dress fit snug but that was to be expected considering I am eight months pregnant. However, this dress is not made for women with smaller breasts. The chest part is cut too low and it doesn't fit right because my breasts are smaller. I am wearing this dress for my baby shower, it should work out well once i get some body tape.


Gorgeous dress. I haven’t wore it out yet but I have tried it on. Shows off the curves.


This dress was perfect fit. I love it!!


Really nice dress. Good fabric and cute style. Based on reviews I purchased a medium but it was too loose in the waist area. I'll be returning for a small. For reference, I am 5'6, 148lbs but my waist is rather small.
