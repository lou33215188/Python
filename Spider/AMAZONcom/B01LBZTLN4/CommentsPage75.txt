Dress fits nice...almost wish i got a medium...large fits but a tiny bit loose and a dress like this is meant to be tight


Fit well. Received so many compliments!!!


I purchased the dress in red size small. The top fit somewhat large probably because of the boning(wire) that ran around the front of the bust. The bottom fit as described.


Love iyt


order 2 sizes up


Quality is what you'd expect for the price. Zipper is a little difficult to get closed.


Receive item early and I love it.


Zipper needs a little work.


I ordered this dress and am not disappointed! Great Material....the color was true white. Extremely comfortable.


I wish there were more colors to choose from! I received endless compliments


Loved this dress. It fit perfectly and looked super expensive. I got a ton of compliments.
