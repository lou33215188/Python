Zipper  broken


Perfect dress good quality great fit !!


Cheaply made


Poor quality.


My error.  I actually ordered it too large, thinking that it might run smaller than expected.


The fit wad nice and comfortable


Excellent fit. Very classy


fit as expected. I ordered a BLACK dress not DARK BLUE so I'll be sending it back smh


Was also damaged the v design was bent and coming out


I like the dress it was a little to big and the zipper was missing.
