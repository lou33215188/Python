Wore this dress to a wedding and received many many many compliments! purchased a size Medium. I'm 5' 7 1/2' tall 1620lbs. This dress was to die for. The wire in the front of the dress that helps creat the V cut is stating to come through the fabric. I think the price that i paid for the dress was well worth it.


I absolutely love this dress. I am 5'8 and 220 pounds I ordered a XL and it fit perfectly. I wear it to my Grandfather's 80th Birthday Celebration and received so many compliments.


I love love love this dress!!! Brought it to wear for my birthday party.  I'm 5'2, a size10/12 and curvy. I brought the large. It fit perfectly and hugged my curves. The quality was great for the amount of the dress. I want to order another one.


My boyfriend bought this dress for my birthday  and I loved it so much. You can't go wrong with this one the material is great and it's true to colour


The dress was cute and very sexy but the shoulder part was too wide so it kept on falling. I usually wear a size small so I would recommend to order a size smaller than your normal size if you are petite/ skinny .


I ordered a 2x im 5'4 230-240lbs I want to send it back and go one size smaller but its ok also if your boobs aren't perky then make sure u have a U bra or opened middle bra other than that the dress is awesome and it's spandex so it stretches and have moving room it you want it fitted order down or right at your size


LOVE, LOVE LOVE THIS DRESS!!!  I READ THROUGH THE REVIEWS AND DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE 2XL ( I USUALLY WEAR A 20 ).  I DID HAVE TO WEAR WITH A PANTY GIRDLE AS I AM ROUND IN THE MIDDLE.  I RECEIVED SO MAY COMPLIMENTS AND THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIAL WAS THICKER THAN EXPECTED WHICH IS A PLUS.  I WORE THIS TO A WHITE PARTY.  I WILL BE BUYING THIS IN ANOTHER COLOR.  THUMBS UP TO THE SELLER AS IT ARRIVED AS PROMISED.


So upset. I got this dress for a semi formal party and paid extra to have this delivered the next day. Unfortunately for me, this was sewn together incorrectly, and one of the arm straps is twisted. I was planning to purchase in multiple colors, but now I just want my money back and will have to find something else to wear. It actually fit well and I love the built in bra. The zipper is an issue;cheaply made, and sticks out since it's silver, instead of black


I absolutely loved the dress except  it was two other women with the same exact dress different colors.  The fitting was perfect the color was exactly what I imagined. My only negative feeling was that breastpads was not removable
