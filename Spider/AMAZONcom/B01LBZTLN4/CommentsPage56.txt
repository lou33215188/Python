niceeeee very classy


Very nice but it's a little bit big


Way too much cleavage. If you like that kind of thing, you'd love it.


This dress fits me so beautiful! At first when I took it out of the package and felt the material I was like hell no ! But when I try it on I was like yes yes n yes


Every woman needs one of these. Fits great. And flatters your body. Ladies if you are concious about a little bulge around your spanx will do the trick. I promise. Get the dress. You won't regret it. I use the size chart it will fit as expected.


I liked this dress, i returned it because it was too dressy for my occasion.


I had to return it for a smaller size.  But It's gorgeous and extremely sexy.


Dress material is very thick and durable, should of ordered a size M, in very small in the waist and big hips and not too large breast so the fit was almost there but not quite I will probably have to shrink it but 9/10!


Very disappointed, this is nothing like the picture. I returned it.


Fits like a glove!
