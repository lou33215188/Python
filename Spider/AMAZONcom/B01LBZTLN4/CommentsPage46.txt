I love it !!!perfect dinner dress I purchased a XL I'm 190 pounds 5"3


Wire broke through the fabric in the front. No clasp at the top of the zipper in the back.


Its pretty but was hard to maneuver in as far as the arms.


Iâ€™ve been wanting to get this dress for some time now and finally purchased. I was disappointed because I saw so many good reviews. The zipper is terrible quality and the front area stuck out and did not all around fit well. Had to return :/


I never put the dress on.  The material feels cheap and the zipper looks cheap.  The dress is solid black and he zipper stands out as it is silver.  Will not wear!


Gorgeous can't believe the price.


Great dress I wore it for my wedding but it was larger than I thought. Not to big but was still able to wear


I am so happy with this dress! It fit nicely and I am looking forward to wearing it.


Loved, loved, loved the fit, cut, color, cloth texture, length, everything!!! I received soooo many compliments and people asking where I bought the dress! :)


I wear a 14-16 and an XL fit petfectly!!


This is a perfect dress! I would definitely recommend this dress for any special occasion. Perfect fit, perfect color, perfect material and I look great in it!! Thanks
