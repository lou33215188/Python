I had to pay a tailor to sew the extreme too large shoulder straps. Beautiful concept but the picture is deceptive.


Small fits a little big in bust but looks great 5'4 115 lbs thick material great quality


This is a nice dress, but definitely not for those women with a larger bust area. I had to return it because I was too exposed up top.


Looks Great on her


The small was too large. The chest area was too large and i am 34c!! The material was thick and better than expected but the cut of the top area was awkward and it stuck out. I pulled the staps on top and made it work, one time wear.


I love the dress but I need a medium.  I bought a small. I'm 5ft 2 inches and 150lbs. I ordered based on the comments. But a medium one would for better. This dress came in blue instead of black like I ordered. I tried it on and it looked very much blue instead of black.


The dress is beautiful. I ordered it a large but should have bought it a medium. The boob and shoulder area are loose you should size it down.


great fit


super super cute dress.  Love it.
