love the fit, good material not cheap or thin, I am 5'6" 140lbs a small fit perfectly.


Love it ğŸ˜�


When I received the dress there where stains and spots all over it no tags or anything on it.. so i guess i paid for a â€œUSEDâ€� dress..


Love the style of dress and the color, however it was a little to big for me. Iâ€™m 5â€�4, about 144 and 34D and I got a medium. Overall great dress!!!


I loved this dress ! I am 5â€™3 165lbs and the medium fit perfect !!! I felt like a doll all night long !!!


Love this dress!!!


Nice Fit!


I bought this dress for my court wedding I got an XL but it was a bit big the material is thick and stretchy.


This just donâ€™t fit right at all and thereâ€™s a stain on the top!!! Mainly for full figured women!


The dress is amazing...but wrong colour I order a black dress and recieve a dark blue
