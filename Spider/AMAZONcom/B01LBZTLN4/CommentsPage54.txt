Fits great


I love this dress!!!


Great dress for the money! I didn't give it 5 stars because the sleeves are bigger than average zipper is poor quality.  But other than this great buy. I wear a size 14 x-large fit great.


A little small but still nice.


Love it, the material is tick and it fit perfectğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ


I order the dress one day before the concert... got here on time. ğŸ’˜ğŸ’˜â�¤â�¤â�¤


I'm 5'4 128 pounds and a small is a little to large would still wear,  but the dress I received has stains on the back of the dress. I am returning, unsure if I want to re-order this dress or another.


The dress is great except for the incorrectly sown in strap. I am returning it because of that issue but will be ordering another one. I am 235 lbs 5'5" and ordered the XL and it fits great with shapeware on :)


Love the black dress


its a nice dress my daughter got a lot of compliment in it. Im just sorry their is no extra small size but the dress maker was great in making the adjustment


Good quality
