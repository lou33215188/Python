I'm 5'5" 145lbs. Medium fit was perfect. I was able to go bra less, I'm an a cup. Very flattering and got a ton of compliments. Downside, the rigged v shape has a metal bar that popped out the top when I opened the package. Easy enough to push back in and I had no further problems, but it's the reason I took 1 star off.


It is very nice.


Amazing


I was very disappointed with this product.  This material is very cheap and it made horribly.  I was very disappointed and upset with this product.  Please don't purchase this product it does even look the picture just cheap looking horrible product.

The dress is ok however the wire at the front of the bra was awkwardly placed and had to be adjusted .I purhcased one in a different color and didnt have this problem. The arms were a bit too big for me and i had to adjust them .However the quality was good so I am not too disappointed would definitely get a medium next time.i purchased it in a large. My measurements are 32-29-45.


This dress fits like a glove, it hugged my curves in all the right places. I am 5'2 195lbs and I ordered size Large.


I received so many compliments on my dress. Absolutely no complaints at all.


Love this classy dress. it looks and fits perfect.  I will definitely purchase from this seller again. Keep in mind the deep v neck feature so you need a neck plunging bra to accommodate. The dress has bra pad inside that gives a smooth and supported look. Great item.


Thank you.
