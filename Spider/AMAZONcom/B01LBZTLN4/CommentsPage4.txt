I'll start off by saying I'm 6'2 and 180lbs so finding a dress that's a decent length is rare for me.  This dress falls just past my knees.  I ordered the large and it fits really well so I would say the sizing runs a bit large. The material feels like spandex to me but it isn't see through. There is a light padding in the chest area and underwire where the deep "V" is. On one side there seems to be extra fabric around the "V" which is causing the sleeve to fold over a bit, instead of staying flat. As others have mentioned, it does bunch up in the back where the zipper is. Nonetheless, it's a super cute dress and worth the money to me.


I will admit, I was skeptical about this dress initially, but it was beautiful on. I purchased it in white for an event ang got soooo many compliments. I am a size 12 and the large fit perfectly. The material is thick enough to hide flaws and stretchy enough to move with you. The one bad thing about this dress that everyone else has mentioned is the zipper...it is terrible and is difficult to get up (I took off one star for that). I am considering getting it replaced if I wear the dress again. I may even get this dress in another color. Two thumbs up!!


I got so many compliments on this dress. I wasn't able to wear a bra. I had to get the bra tape. But it was worth every penny! I actually could have gotten it a little smaller because it fell off my shoulders a bit.


I love this dress so did everyone else lol.the material is great especially for the price.I weight 200 pounds and ordered a xlarge which was big.I returned it with no problem and got a medium which fits me way better.customer service was great thank you so much for my bday dress


Loved the dress, I'm 5'7 and 170 and I got an XL. Could have probably got a large but I was very comfortable wasn't too tight


Prior to purchasing this dress I read all the reviews but did not find exactly what I was looking for so I decided to write a review.


1. True to size. Currently 227 lbs (ğŸ˜©) wearing a Large


2. Tall girls beware. I am 5'10" with hips, dresses are always too short.


3. Drop sleeves are snug and will slide up with all arm movement. Annoying but oh well. Smaller frames may not experience this issue as much.


4. Zipper is not hidden and tends to bunch up. It is very difficult to maneuver on your own. See picture 2.


5. Fits like a glove. Top of the dress fits amazingly. I paired it with a double strapped bra (with strapless option) from Cacique that blended well. Someone else had the same dresa on so im glad the straps made mine look differently. With DDD's its easy to fill out the top. C cups or smaller may change the look of the dress. See picture 3.


6. Material exceeded my expectations! Thick but will show everything.  Wear a shaper if you have problems areas and/or want to hide your pantyline.


7.Comfort. lost one star for lack of comfort. As a bodycon dress, I thought it was made for curves. NOT! The dress shifted to the right with every 3 steps. I had to constantly adjust the seams and pull the dress up. But we cant expect perfection for $20.


Simple, Elegant Dress! Add accessories that pop and your own twist.


Great fit, classy and sexy


When I tell you this dress was the BOMB.COM, ITS THE BOMB.COM!!!!! This dress fit perfectly around my curves.  No tugging and pulling all night.  Made my shape stand out like the perfect hour glass figure.  I had Rave reviews and comments.  I bought this for my 41st bday and it did me the justice I wanted for a 41 year old look  SEXY Yet Not To Revealing look!!! Yessssssss I LOVED IT!! I'm 4'11,  breast a 36F and usually wear 12/14 .  I bought the 12/14 size.  The material will glide around your body.  Omg this dress though.  My husband couldn't keep his hands off of me.


I am returning the dress because it fits a little snug. My returning it does not take away from the beauty and quality of the dress. It is made from a thick nylon that offers stretch, I am just not comfortable wearing it to the event that I purchased it for. I normally wear a size 14 and ordered a large because of some of the reviews and I would suggest a XL unless you're okay with your rolls spilling over. In all fairness, I also usually wear spanks with my formal wear and I did not try it on with them.


Thinner Scuba type material. I bought a large but should have got an XL. I'm a size 14 with 38F breasts.
