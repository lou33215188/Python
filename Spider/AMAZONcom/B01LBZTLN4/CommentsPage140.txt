Received a lot of compliments. The material did not have a cheap feel. The a better zipper could be selected for this dress.


Beautiful dress but the top didn't fit as expected, had to make adjustments.


I absolutely love this dress!!!! I got it for my LBD birthday dinner and got all the compliments.  It is a xxl and fits and hugs if you are ok with it being fitted.  I'm 5'6", 255, size 16/18 and 40DDD
