I am 5'6", 145lbs 32B. I usually wear a size 6 and I ordered the 4/6. This dress is LOVELY!! It's a tad too big but I'm going to wear it anyway. The top part fits well, it's more the body of the dress that is big. I like it anyway and I'd recommend.


Dress arrived with a hole in it very poor stitching also theirs glue on the back of the dress


Hate it. Feels and looks cheap


I order a large at first, but it was too big. I reorder a medium and it fit perfect. Thick material (not see through), but not heavy.  I am 5'7 and weigh 165lbs.


Beautiful dress it just runs way too small


Not really recommend for women with big breast.


Got it for the wife she loves it


The dress is a pretty dress how ever it was the wrong size. I ordered xl got 5xl instead well that's what the label says anyways but the dress fits like a 2xl which is still too big


The dress fit ok but you get what you pay for. The zipper in the back was really large and very cheap, hard to zip.


This dress was perfect at my black tie event. Very classy. However, the wire in the dress came out on the second wear.
