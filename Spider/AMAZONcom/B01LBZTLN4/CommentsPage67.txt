Nice ğŸ‘—, ordered a size too big but overall it's an ok dress.


I love the dress the fabric is very nice and it clings to your body how ever the top part was a little loose on me but I love everything about the dress


The dress fits amazing, it's very complimentary in all the right places. I would definitely buy this dress again ğŸ¤—


Nice quality unfortunately is somewhat smaller than I expected. My size fluctuates so I will keep it until I can fit it comfortably.


Good material


I love it and it fits well. :)


I didn't appreciate the fabric...looked too cheap.


I love this dress! The fabric was thick but flattering! I cannot say enough amazing things.


For us full figure women this dress is perfect! Hides what it needs to hides and shows off what it needs to show off! Love it!


The dress is gorgeous and fits like a dream! I thought it would run small so I went a size up but definitely could've gotten my true size. Either way it still fits very nice and looks so nice on
