I am 5'9 small in the bust and extremely hippy. So i ordered an extra large thinking i would need room for my thighs.  I WEIGH 190 LBS last i checked. The dress is made of great material. Kinda shiny.. It also stretches so it was WAAAAAYYYYY too big..  I ordered a large hoping it would be a better fit. MAYBE i shoild have ordered a medium..


Not flattering, itâ€™s like polyester and wires! Not happy!! Returning immediately!!


The material is nice and the dress well made but it runs a bit large. I usually wear medium but should have ordered a small


The Wires in front needed restitching. One poked out. The entire dress needed more sewing and tacking down in places.


I loved it! Great deal for the price. The dress showcases every curve in my body very well..


Fit a little big, top is made awkward.


I got XL. I am 5 feet tall and 190lbs, 38DDD and it fit very nicely. I will be getting more colors.


Perfect fit looks very elegant and the material does not feel cheap. Great buy


Good quality.  Runs a little big.  I bought a large and I wear a size 8.


I loved this dress. True to the color that is presented. Received many compliments, however, I had some issues with the top part. It may suit women with bigger breasts better. It is true to size but if you prefer it to be on the tighter side choose small (if you are a Medium). I love that I can switch it up and wear the sleeves up.
