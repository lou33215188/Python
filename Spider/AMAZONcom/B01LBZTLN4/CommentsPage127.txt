Too large


Disappointed.


I ordered this for my wife -- she says:  This is very pretty, fits as expected (2X), good quality.  However, the zipper is barely functional.  It just doesn't go up or down smoothly.  Or at all.  And it's not a sizing issue, it doesn't work when it's not on me either.  It took my husband 5 minutes and a pliers (the zipper handle immediately broke off, and the zipper handle itself was too small for the amount of strength/grip required to operate the zipper) to get this thing zipped up.  He tried for about 15 minutes to unzip it before I just wiggled my way out (thank god it's stretchy) and let him continue working on it without it on (he did eventually get it unzipped).  I'm not going to return this because it's a very nice dress and I think I can just wiggle in and out of it with the zipper up and just never unzip it.  Minor peeve -- there's no hook/eye closure at the top, so it's just the stiffness of the zipper holding it up (not an issue here, but if someone ends up with a good zipper they would probably want to add the hook/eye closure).  Still worth it for the price, I think, but very frustrating to require tools to put on my clothes..


Love this dress!


Love it fit perfect
