The dress is beautiful! I love the material it made of it feels amazingggg! Im alittle concerned about the zipper, looks like it won't last too long. I ordered a small but it still a bit big on me. So I'm having it tailored before I wear it out☺️ Other than that I'm really happy with it


Beautiful dress....but horrible zipper. I wore this dress and felt beautiful until my zipper kept unzipping all the way down literally undressing me in public 5 times.wtf.I was so embarrassed and had nothing to change into so I had to sit with my back against the wall all night.


Perfect love it


Loved it.


Didnt care for the matieral cheap looking almost to small ....


Nice dress, color looks just like the picture. The quality of the material is a bit flimsy but the dress fits nice.


Love the dress. I’m 130lbs and got a small. It was a little too big. A xsmall would have fit tighter.


This is a gorgeous dress for the price. Had many compliments on it. Everyone thought i purchased it from nordstroms. I am 5'9 155 34DD. Ordered a medium. Fit perfect. Had a little too much room in the chest but stayed up nice the entire evening.


Very beautiful


DRESS IS THIN AT BOTTOM PART. THE PADDING IN THE DRESS WAS NOT VERY PHOTO FRIENDLY SHOULDN'T HAVE  BEEN THERE! OTHER THAN THAT THIS DRESS WAS BEAUTIFUL.
