I loved this dress!


This item came to large !! Not good


Love it


Beautiful dress, well-made. It runs small.


I am 5'9 225 lbs and usually wear XL/1X. I ordered this in 2X and THAT fit as expected (snug and form-fitting, with Spanx on). I would order a size up from your regular size. It looks great! My only complaint is the zipper is super flemsy. I couldn't zip it all the way on my own because you need to hold the dress while you pull the zipper. But, still 5 stars for the price! I bought it and another dress for NYE. Even if I don't wear it that night, it's gonna be hard to return it.
