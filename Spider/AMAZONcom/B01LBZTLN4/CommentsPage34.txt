I loved it,  it fit perfectly,  I got so many compliments about how beautiful my dress was


Recieved item with stains on the sleeve. I needed this dress for a wedding ... just s waste of my time. Plus its see through. ..very thin material


This dress is amazing! For the price you canâ€™t beat it. I got so many compliments on it! I am wearing the medium. I love it so much I am thinking about ordering a different color! Great buy!


Just love this dress, now if I can get the nerve to wear it. It does run a little small


This dress was perfect. Can't wait to wear it's again.


Very nice fits lovely idk if my boobs will hold up without a bra but material and style is nice


Didn't even want to give 1 star! Worst dress ever! Returning!


When I received the dress I was happily surprised, the fabric was a better quality than expected and the wire/padding looked durable. But before trying it on I saw that the stitching on some of the seams is loose and there is a small hole one of the seams as well.


I absolutely looooove this dress! I have not worn it yet but will post a pic as soon as I do


Wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments. Everyone assumed it was an expensive dress from a department store. The burgundy color is so rich and photographs like a dream.
