Beautiful dress!!! Im 5â€™8 187lbs and I ordered a medium. I fits like a dream


Loved the dress great quality but ran a little big


Looks just like the picture posted


Bought a small and it was more like a medium. The breast area is not comfortable. Returned it right away.


I love this dress so much. I wore it for my birthday and it was a killer. I wish I bought other colours


Poorly made the bottom stich is roughly dine


You need to order a size up. The bust area is not very secure. If you are busty, pass on this dress.


Nice dress I love it


The color is true to the picture & cute. However, the material is a bit see through & the boning where the v neck meets doesn't hold the shape well.


Not U.S. size
