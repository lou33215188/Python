Pretty dress. I really wish it fit me but it ran way too large large. A medium fits like a extra large so order down a size to 2 sizes, if you like your dresses fitted.


Happy thank you ğŸ˜Š


Looks great on small, medium, large and extra large bodies.


Nice and classy dress! The dip in the front is a little low


Horrible this dress looks powdered blue nowhere near white and the seam in bra was improperly attached.


My two year old could have done a better job.


love it


The zipper was very difficult to go up. I'm generally a medium, but this medium was too big.


I wanted to love this dress but it ran much too big and the shoulder part fit a bit awkward.


Beautiful,  fix as expected


I don't give five stars because I don't like the zipper qualify


Otherwise  you look great !


Oh how I love this dress. It hits my curves in just the right places. As far as quality goes- you get what you pay for. But for the price point, you really can't beat it for a special event!
