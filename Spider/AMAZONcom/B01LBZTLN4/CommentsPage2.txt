I love this dress.


Love love love this dress. I'm a 14 size. Large fit perfectly. Stretchy as well.


Really cute dress. Got a lot of compliments and I felt good in it. It's not perfect in the back, it bunches up a tad but for the price it didn't really matter. The material is good too. It's almost like satin and not like a lycra

Dress is true to color, well made, and a little stretchy. It runs big.I would not encourage my small busted girls to get this style. I am 5'5" small b cup and slim. I ordered the small and the waste was over 27 inches.


Great dress.  I'm 5"2, 122lbs. I ordered the size 4/6 and it fit perfectly inthe hips but I had to take it in in the sleeves and bodice but it turned out very nice.


I am 5 ft tall,  175lbs, 38DD with a big booty. I'm curvy.  I normally wear a size 12/13. I ordered a large based off the reviews and it fit perfectly with room to move around. It supported my breast well and the material was excellent. Felt more expensive than it was.  I'm buying it in all colors! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! (I didn't have on support garments or a good bra in this pic and it still looks nice)


I love it


Beautiful dress!


Ok so I've tried the dress on again with some sexy black pumps and I changed my mind. I purchased a medium and it fits pretty good and I like it, can wait to step out in it. I wish the fabric quality was heavier, but for the $$ it's ok.
