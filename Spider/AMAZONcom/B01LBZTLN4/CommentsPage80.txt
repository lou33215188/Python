Fit ok.. still cute


I did not like the purplish tinge to the white fabric, it worked for what I wanted the occasion.


Ang I definitely would buy it again in a different color.


This dress is beautiful its work the  buy. one small problem was the zipper. it gathers in the back slightly.


it the zipper was plastic instead of metal it would be 6 stars!


always wanted a very sexy seductive dress and this is it!!! love it


Cut too low in front, plastic makes it hard to alter and it's too bit, should have a metal wire instead of plastic, otherwise dress would be perfect


The dress is nice but not for me. Because of my clevage, the front side stretch out and it did not look good on me. I will be returning it.


Love the dress just wish there was a better zipper in the dress


Great dress but weird pads in the chest area that show through the material.


Nice product A+++++


Fits perfectly, good material i will be ordering this dress in other colors
