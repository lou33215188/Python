Omgee got the dress today and it fits perfectly im pregnant and I got the large size dress wow so comfortable worth every penny!!!!


My dress look lovely the only problem i have is with the brest part i don't have enough to fit in it lol but the material is lovely and it fit my body good love it


The dress had being used  I order when I receive it shape of.the shoulder was not there smelling like smoke. To the distributor.Bad business everything should be look at first not repackage.


The dress is nice but it doesn't hold up to my breast since they are much smaller cup compared to the XL dress I ordered the wire under the dress doesn't help either.


The silver zipper is a little more pronounced than portrayed on the picture. But great dress for the price. My husband will love it!


dont remember. And I also thought it was cloth, I did not like the fabric.


Dress is falling apart. Threading is awful! Will never buy from this seller again. I will have to pay to have it altered due to time! Thanks a lot!


Great dress for the price. I'm a size 14 and ordered a large. No regrets, would purchase again in a different color.


I wore this to a Birthday Dinner and received lots of good comments on it! Love it! It's true to size.


i love this dress
