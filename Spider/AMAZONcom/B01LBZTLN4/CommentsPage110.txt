love this dress it fits beautiful


The fit was awful.  The fabric looks cheap and badly made.


Love...love..love


I loved my dress. It was true to size.


Cute dress, Somewhat too tight, I recommend people to order one size up


Came on time fits great but the zipper had some minor problem its was hard to zip up


Overall great


Fits really nice. Not a bad dress for the price.


This product is kinda cheap... No lining


However the white elestic used at the top is quite tackie


The only issue with the dress is the built-in Bra cup thing. Not fit for large breasts.
