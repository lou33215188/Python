buttom part is good top falls right off . plus its a thin material


5'4" 135 medium in all dresses but this one was way too big. It was loose all over and the length was only a few inches from the floor. It looks hideous! Returning it right away! Also the zipper is cheap quality felt like it was going to break as I tried it on. Don't waste your time or money


It didn't look exactly like the picture. My daughter didn't like it so it was returned. The material was nice though.


I was stunned at how beautifully this modestly priced dress fits.


i love this dress its very comfortable if you have big boobs the dip in front can be annoying you need a special bra or wear black (thats what i did)


the zipper fyi is a silver exposed zipper if you want to match accessories i wish it was black and not visible but other than that its great! i love it!


Fit perfectly and a perfect red dress to add to any woman's collection


THIS DRESS IS AMAZING, THE FIT WAS PERFECT. IT'S VERY CLASSY AND SOPHISTICATED.


It's ok.


The dress came slightly different in the bust area than what is shown. There are also some padding in the breast area that does nothing but make it look like I stuffed slices of baloney into my dress. It's also hard to take that padding out because its sewn into the dress.


Like the style, but it was too big for me.


Yes, I will purchase from this vendor again :)
