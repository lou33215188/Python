Fit is beautiful. Material is good. Very nice dress.


The dress fit fine but when i received it, it looked as if someone had wasted something on it.


The material of the dress is really nice.  Iâ€™m little disappointed that the dress did not fit.  I  loved the dress.  I recommend!!!!!


The dress kept shifting so the zipper wasn't straight down the back it was twisting to the side,luckily my niece would come up behind me and adjust it. Very pretty dress though perhaps if i purchased a size smaller wouldn't be any room to shift. Maybe....


I got so many compliments on this dress. It fits perfect. Love this dress!


The dress was too large and didn't look anything like the picture. False advertisement. I had to return the dress.


Only problem with this dress is that,the chest area,comes down really low,so if u have big boobs then I don't recommend this dress endless ur okay with it


Fit well on my body. Got compliments all night-


This dress is amazing! The fit is great and hides the not so flattering tummy pudge. Lol This material is great for curvy women.


Great quality dress
