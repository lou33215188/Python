I love this dress. Omg it was above my expectations. I am 5'5 and 150 I ordered a medium. I wore it for our Valentine's Day dinner.


I'm 5'5, and currently 206 at 36 weeks pregnant and I absolutely adore this dress! I wore it to my baby shower this past weekend and I received many compliments on it! The only thing I would have changed was to remove the padding in the breast area. It doesn't really do anything for the person or dress. Other than that I loved it! ğŸ˜�â�¤


But it's beautiful !


Gorgeous dress, fit true to size. I'm little over 200 pounds and I purchase a xl.


OMG!!! As a plus size woman, I just knew this dress was going to be too small. But it fit like perfect glove in all the right places. The material felt simply awesome!!! Absolutely LOVED IT!!!


I absolutely loooooved the dress!!! I received so many compliments!!!! I weigh 230lbs and I'm 5'5 and I ordered a XL and it fit PERFECTLY!!!! I received the dress in 2 days and I'm so in love with this dress .


 I had the get the shoulders fixed cause it was too big but I expected it cause I'm small at the top but good outfit ...


I am 5'6, 36ddd, and weigh 125 lbs. I purchased a medium and it was too large around the arms. The bottom was a little loose as well, but I made this dress work by pulling up the sides on the arms! See picture. I plan on purchasing this again. The color of the dress was radiant, and quality was amazing.


I got this for my friends wedding & after trying it ok I knew this was the perfect dress! It's structured so it's not cheap material & wont fall apart easily. It looks amazing. I wish I had more boobs to fill it out but that is not the dresses fault. I am 5'8" and it still came past my knees which I loved most. It also has stretch to it so I can move in it.


Wedding Ready!! This dress fit me amazing! Nothing cheap about it.
