I wore this dress for my bday...paired it with my red bottoms. Needless to say. The Lady in Red turned heads! Make a wish!


I really love the dress. It is a little bit loose but I can deal. I thought it would be too long since I'm 5'2 but it was perfect length. I ordered a Large based on the reviews. I will update this review when I actually wear it.


I absolutely loved this dress. Four Stars only because, the breast pads were horrible. I was able to unstich the area and remove them. I placed my own old "Victoria Secrets" bra inside and sew it back together. Lifted them babies very well. Im 5'1,175lbs and I ordered a large. It fit great and felt great! Compliments all night!


I really didn't care for this dress.


I ordered a small but it for a little big I an 5ft 5in 132lb this will need alterations for it to be close fitted like in the photo as the colour it's really dark not wat i was expecting. But I like it none the less.


Very sexy... Material is different from the pic nevertheless it's still cute n fits well... I tweak mine a bit by adding straps n the lace at the breast area


nice!!


I can't wait to put on my dress on my birthday


Not for busty women


The material of this dress is very thick and it stretches. Perfect fit. I would definitely recommend it. Bought this dress for my sister 36,34,43 Large.
