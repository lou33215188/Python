Okay! I love the concept of the dress. A couple of things I had to do to make it work for me. I removed the pads from the inside and took the dress to the cleaners to have it re-stitched. I also found a burgundy zipper at JoAnn's and had the cleaners replace the cheap zipper that wasn't to sturdy. Both adjustments cost me $20 total. Now I will get more than 1 wear out of the dress. Did all of this in 1 day.....


Prob one of my fave dresses


ğŸ˜� THIS DRESS WAS PERFECT FOR THE FORMAL EVENT I ATTENDED. I'M 5'3 AND 175 LBS. THIS WAS A MEDIUM SIZE. LENGTH HIT RIGHT BELOW THE KNEE. I RECEIVED SO MANY COMPLIMENTS THAT NIGHT INCLUDING FROM THE HUBBY.


Comfy and looked great for black tie wedding.


I purchased this dress for an upcoming wedding in Vegas. The dress fits as expected and the material and the zipper are of good quality (very important when your a size 16) its a tiny bit small and I could have gone up a size (I bought xl) but that's really me just being unrealistic about the size of my chunky frame and no fault to the manufacturer. The breasts cup def don't have a TON of support so you either need to invest in a good plunge bra,  some bra adhesives or get creative with some clear duct tape if you dont want to be flopping out of it by 1 am. Overall,  I'm happy with my purchase.


I loved this dress, wore it to a wedding. Fits perfectly (XL) with plenty of room to move so I probably could have went a size smaller. Sturdy, soft, semi-stretch material that gave the dress an elegant look.  I'm size 16 in pants and large in t-shirts so i was mostly  concerned how everything would fit over larger hips and thighs but it did!


I'm giving this dress 4/5 stars only because after I washed it the metal in the boob ear popped out :( sadly I had to return it. But I tried it on and it fit great! My husband loved it on me. So I got a Large and it fit just fine. It's a very stretchy material. The dres is kind of big on the boob opening part. I wore a nude strapless bra. Prob would've worked a bit better if I had larger boobs lol. I'm 200lbs- Bra size 36C- 5'7.


I love this dress!!!! However I am returning for a few reasons.


1) The top is a little too big


2) The sleeves were a little too loose


3) The wire in the V is not flexible and is  annoying.  If you have a smaller cleavage it will be very noticeable


Overall I love the dress!! I wear a size medium in dresses and I should've ordered a small in this dress for it to be fitting in the bust area.


 Do not hesitate to order! However if you have smaller bust then order a size under. I am a 36C


I absolutely love this dress!!! I purchased it for a 30th black & white birthday celebration and I received a lot compliments that night. I'm typically a size 16 in dresses so I ordered a 2XL and it fit perfectly! I received it in no time! Great product, great price!


Perfect fit. I'm excited about wearing this dress.
