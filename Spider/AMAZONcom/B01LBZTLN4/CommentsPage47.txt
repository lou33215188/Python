My husband absolutely loves this dress on me. I love it too, very sexy


I’m three months pregnant and weigh 225 the 2x was a lil too big but it’s a wonderful dress. I got a lot of complements on this dress at the birthday dinner.  Will order one in a different color for my baby shower!!!


I had to pay to make it fit on me cause I could not return it.


Sexy, nice fit. Beautiful burgundy.


OMG i'm in love with this dress.  Super pretty, thick material, classy.


Definitely has a Jessica Rabbit feel. Loved it


very sexy


Nice outfit for a night. Wore it to my company Christmas dance and it was a hit. Becarful because the girls might fall out but other then that it's a great outfit.


The middle front is kinda loosely fit


Great dress. but I ordered black and got Navy.
