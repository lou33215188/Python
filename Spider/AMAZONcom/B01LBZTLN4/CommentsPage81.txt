The front looks strange so make sure you zoom in very nice quality fabric I would order a smaller size because u want a snug fit especially cause black covers it


I love this dress. However i need to amend the top part. Too much cleavage exposed


The fit is very nice. I may order in Black


I least like the zipper which immediately was difficult to zip up.


See through material. Not impressed with the quality or the v-part in the front. Looked super cheap.


Absolutely LOVEEEEEEE this dress!!!


First my package was put on my neighbors door step not mine. And I recieve a dark purple dress not a black dressğŸ¤¦ğŸ�¾â€�â™€ï¸�


It was nice, just didn't fit on the top very well


This dress did not fit right around the calf. It fit like a pillow case.


really nice dress and fits well on my curves however the material is exactly what you pay for.
