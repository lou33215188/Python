good...


Wore it when I was 3 months pregnant and received so many compliments!


Sexy dress. Haven't worn it out yet but it fits great!


The dress arrived filthy.  All around the entire shoulder as well as under the arms.  This was evidently a returned item, but why would the “cleaner” send it out to a new customer?  Absolutely ridiculous.  I was wearing this dress in 3 days.  What now????


Beautiful dress.


I absolutely love this dress.  It fits very nice.  I received so many compliments. I will be ordering in another color or two.


I purchased this dress to celebrate my birthday and I absolutely love this dress! I'm 5'2 212lbs. Initially ordered large but too small. I then returned and ordered a XL it was doable but very little room to maneuver. So ended up with XXL in the picture fit just right!


Loved the style of the dress. But if you have larger breast this dress may be a challenge.


I'm 5'8" @180. Curvy with 38ddd breast. Bought large.. boobs didn't fit. Tried the XL boobs fit but the "V" part was far to revealing to be taken seriously. Wish it could have been altered. The wine is soooo perfect or fall.


Fit like a glove!!


Got it for my sister and my mom tried to keep it for her self they both tried it on and it looked good on them both!!!
