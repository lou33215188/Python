It fits great the only down side is the top part if you have small breast and the zipper was hard to zip up


Omg I just got it today I love it I'll Order it in other colors


I brought this dress for my daughter to wear to an all white party and she looked amazing. The fit was great!


Excellent piece great fit great price


tummy area has too much wiggle room. not fitted on the tummy area. good material .


Really cheap looking really bad quality went in the garbage


I was a bit anxious on wether or not the dress would have fitted, but i followed the size guideline and it fitted beautifully.


Fits a bit smaller than I expected and is a little inaccurate with the measurments!


Beautiful dress, accentuate your curves ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


This dress is very nice. It fits true to size, I usually wear a medium so after reading the reviews that's what I bought and it fits great!
