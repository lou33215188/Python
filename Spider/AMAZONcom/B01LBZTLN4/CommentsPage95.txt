Looks real nice and stretches a good bit


The material is superb. The length is what I wanted. On my knees.


RECEIVED the dress today, fabric is SOFT, perfect fit. True to size, looks more expensive than it cost.


It would've been perfect except that it came soiled. Looks like someone returned it dirty.


Perfect fit . Would recommend this dress to anyone.


Beautiful elegant dress, fit just as expected .Looking to ordering more dresses with them.


Need suggestions on what size to get. Because i want it to fit in the bust area. I love this dress otherwise . Material is great


love this dress it's a little too big but nothing a little stitch won't fix thank you it came as expected and it looks just like the pic.


Very nice dress, I just wish I knew it ran big and I would of got a smaller size.


It was a cute dress but I would've needed a extra small the sleeves were too big
