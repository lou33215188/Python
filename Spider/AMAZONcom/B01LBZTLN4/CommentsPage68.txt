I like it.  fast delivery


Not great material.  But ok.


Love it. Got it to wear to a wedding. The fit was prefect.


I go so many compliments on this dress. Everyone wanted to know where I got it from and how much it cost. When I told them Amazon, they were shocked and even more shocked at the price.


FIT AMAZINGLY WITH NO ALTERATIONS...I'M A PLUS SIZE 18 WITH A HUGE BACK SIDE...QUALITY WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED...NOT TO MENTION MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS DRESS ON ME


This dress is beautiful and hugs your curves just right. I would rate this 5 stars but will not do so due to the zipper, as I was trying it on I noticed the zipper was broken and had to buy another dress so couldn't even wear it to the event I bought it for.


I'm 5'2 about 220lbs and I bought a 2X. It fits a little to big. But its sill cute


Looks nothing like it does in person as it does on the model. Looked cheaply made. Not impressed. Returning the dress asap.


What I anticipated I ordered as shown in the above picture is not at all what I received. It's discolored, the quality is poor, the zipper is cheap and the size is not true to size! Be aware!


GREAT value, beautiful color and everyone loved it!
