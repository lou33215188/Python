Pretty Color. Once adjusted by my seamstress was perfect!


Dress fits amazing !! Came nice and clean and really made me stand out! I have the pictures on my instagram : Jettjasmine


This is a very well made dress. It was more than I expected for the price. It fit a little snug in the chest, but overall it was a great fit.


Top did not fit well was big


This dress was amazing. I really loved the look and did everyone else. The only thing was the wire in the middle is annoying.


Totally sexy dress. Cheap material and zipper but it looked amazing.


ordered this for an event 3 days prior & it was perfect! fit as expected & was comfy. zipper bunched up a little, but great for the price!


not very well sewn


Love


The fit of the dress is great but the quality of the material is far from spectacular. It looks cheap and the zipper is barely functional
