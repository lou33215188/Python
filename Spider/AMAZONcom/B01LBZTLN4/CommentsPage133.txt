It come not truth the balalaika, so small and light as an accessory, but it doesn't cost this of money (((


Initially the dress fitted perfectly however the zipper broke. Dress was the right size.


I bought a small, it felt like a large, couldn't wear it.


Dislike this dress cheap material. Didn't fit like or look like model dress.


Material is cheap looked nothing like what was advertised.


Dress did not look right, return without wearing.


I love love love it had to get another one in the black fits perfect


I didn't like the zipper or the way it fit up top.


The dress fits very large even in the smallest size.


It fits
