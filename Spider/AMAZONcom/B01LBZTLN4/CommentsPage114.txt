Great buy. Material is nice and thick.


Fits perfectly...I received so many compliments


Doesn't fit in the boob part...


It will definitely be my 40th birthday dress.


Looks like a pouch in the front.. not form fitting.. and took an extra 2 days than originally stated to be delivered..


It was nice my body just wasnâ€™t right for it


Fits well


Was too big, next time order a size smaller


Horrible. Arrived with deodorant stains, inside out, wrinkled. Disgusting!


The dress is beautiful dress.
