Fits well but it was worn before... Could smell the arm scent and smelt like ass


It fits my bottom well, just not my top/chest area


Love!


Not true to size.


The top fit was too large and everything sticking out


I love the colour and the dress fit as expected.


I bought a medium but I should have bought s small.


Cute dress and good material it was just too small for me.


Very nice for the price.


The dress look amazing. Love the dress but is was too big.
