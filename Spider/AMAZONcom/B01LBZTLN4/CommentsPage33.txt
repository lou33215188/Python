I love this dress ! I ordered an extra large thinking it would work but it's a bit too big in the shoulders so I'm reordering a large.  The style is perfect for a semi formal event and it hits the smallest part of my body. The material is sturdy and just the right weight. The dress is true to size and is comfortable to wear .I can't wait to get the large and see how it fits.


Just made strangely, didn't fit well at all. Loose in weird places


The dress that is pictured is not the dress that I received. I ordered burgundy however got a purple dress. it was much bigger than the sizing chart stated and because I had an event to attend I had no choice but to get it altered and wear it. I did not enjoy my night and felt ugly. I doubt I'll ever order clothes through amazon again. extremely disappointed.


Very big and open. Do not fit as in the picture.


The only problem it was a little to big small fits like a medium-sized


love it, a little small in the bust area, but I'm still going to wear it


A sexy looking dress-perfect for evening wear


This dress is beautiful and the fabric doesnâ€™t feel cheap; however, the zipper is very cheap. It was hard to unzip, then harder to zip up while trying it on. The zipper split and the tab to zip it broke. Since this is for today, I had to find a seamstress to replace the entire zipper which costs more than the dress!


A beautiful purchase. Can't wait to wear it.


The dress fit, but the cleavage did not fit neatly.
