the cut is very small


This dress was everything I thought that it would be.  I did not have to continuously pull it down.  It was perfect.


The bra part was off the wiring; but the dress fit me well


Overall the dress is decent. There is metal in the V neck that sticks out and is really hard to bend. The material is a decent quality as well.


Absolutely love this dress!
