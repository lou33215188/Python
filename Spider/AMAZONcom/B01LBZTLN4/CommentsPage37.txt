Slightly large in the breast area, but fits nice


The top part buckles in movement. You have to hold it if you want to dance or do extra movement. Otherwise its a very nice piece.


The dress was a huge success..i am 238 and just had a baby i ordered a xl and it fit nice to the shape and i even could have ordered a large....it was a big hit everone loved it ...i had no problem with the zipper it does bunch a lil in the back and the breast part was a lil to big but u can make it work with a good half bra and tape....will definitely order again....


Love this dress and can not wait to wear it next week. Its very nice and the material was better than expected.


The bottom fit nice but the top is awkward and whatever they used in the middle doesn't stand properly.  I will send this back.


really sexy dress. the pink color does not camouflage anything, you can see every bump.


Love it


The color looked different than what was advertised. It looked more like purple than burgundy


The dress was really pretty. True to color but I had to return it as it was too small. I am a size 18 (260 lbs) so I knew there was a chance it might not work and I was right.


Great material. Great dress
