This dress was perfect! I was skeptical at first. But when I put the dress on with the right bra it was great. The material is of good quality as well. I'm 5'2 and 195 pounds and I got a large. The large fit my curves just right. I believe if I would've got an XL it would have been a bit too big. I wore this dress to a wedding and got plenty of compliments. I would definitely buy from this company again!


I recently had a baby and I decided to go on a mommy me vacation and get sexy this was a last minute dress I read all the reviews and decided to go for it !


And I love the way it fit it's very flattering and I didn't have to adjust it all night


I am 5'2 207lb and a 40ddd and I gotten an xl


Great dress!! I have ample breast and I was concerned that it would not flatter them, but they look great in this dress. I believe I went up a size to be on the safe side, since my arms can be an issue sometimes, but it all worked out, plenty of room. I was glad I could put on my strapless bra as well and it didn't show. The only thing I don't like about the dress is the semi-cheap zipper, I found it difficult to zip up the dress by myself the first time, and the built in foam cups  were in the way, I understand the purpose of them but everyone isn't built the same.


I love it. Looks beautiful


Very nice dress...I'm 192 and the large fit me perfectly


I am 135, 5'3", 31" waist, 39" bust, 37" hip, 36C/D. I ordered the large based on the size chart and the dress was MUCH too large for me. The wire in the V stuck out awkwardly, which I'm not sure would be fixed if the dress actually fit. The fabric is nice and thick. I ordered the pink and the black and you could see the seam allowance through the pink one. I may try it again in a smaller size because the dress is super cute on the model. It seems like it may work best for girls who are very curvy.


UPDATE


I received the size medium, and it fits perfectly.  The dress is absolutely stunning on- a real show stopper!


 The PRO'S:


Sexy as F***!


Fits like a glove.


 Doesn't bunch up in back like some tight fitting dresses I've bought on amazon- you know how the back will sometimes bow out around the zipper (does this only happen to me?) well, this one doesn't do that!


 Vintage-ish length, meaning it goes past the knees, like a wiggle dress from the 50's.


Material is nice and thick, with a little sheen, smoothing out your lumpy places.


CONS:


The metal zipper on the back is tough to zip, the teeth are really big and bulky, seems a little cheap. And, it's silver- I would prefer that it be black to match the dress. I feel like the silver really detracts from the sexiness of the dress.


You can't really lift your arms because of the "sleeves". There will be only demure, low arm movements in this dress! No arm waving or even arm lifting- I doubt you could even get your arm up high enough on a mans shoulder to dance with him, you'd have to hold his low bicep or his elbow.


You can't move very fast in this dress- there is no slit and it goes down past your knees so it really restricts your movement. Coupled with the restrictiveness of the sleeves, you should only wear this to calm, slow moving events, lol.


The V is so low and so sexy that I have no idea where I would have the balls enough to wear it. You will literally have every man in the place, and probably every women too, staring at your amazing cleavage all night long.


The V sticks out a little far from your chest, so that you can ALMOST see some nipple from the right angle. Just be aware when you are wearing it.


I haven't worn it out yet, so I don't know if it is prone to wrinkling. To address the giant V- I am thinking of attaching a black ribbon or fabric  across the top of the V to kind of join the 2 top parts of the V in an effort to make it not so in your face 'Hi, here are my BOOBS!', but then again, I guess that's why we bought the dress in the first place, right? Anyways, I highly recommend you buy it and at least try it on, because you really deserve to see yourself in this dress, at least once.


What can I say ğŸ˜�â�¤ï¸�ï¸� I'm an American size 12/14. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly


Fit well. Fabric is thick and stretches. The zipper is like an industrial zipper and is not hidden; that is my only critique. Also i bought a "sticky bra" where it sticks to your breasts and adds lift...greatly need as the dress doesnt have cups or add lift/cleavage. The v-neck is like a wire which you can feel mine did bust thru the seam but twas easily tucked back in.
