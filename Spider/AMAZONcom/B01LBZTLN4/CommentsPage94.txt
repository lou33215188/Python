The material is just fine. It's just see through and the shoulders are made funny.


Nice dress. I want every color


Had to return. Was not lined...thin material.


Absolutely lovely!


This dress fit perfectly and was great quality .  The zipper was sticky but otherwise it was great , I received lots of compliments.


I was very happy except the wire popped right out of the top the first time trying it on. ğŸ˜�


The dress fits perfectly yet the pads show through the dress making it look cheap


Try it on and loved it!!! Fit right in all the right places wearing this for a winter wonderland wedding


I ordered a large! Bra size is 42D and dress size 14! Word of advice Wear a GOOD Bra!


Cute dress but the zipper was hard to zip up
