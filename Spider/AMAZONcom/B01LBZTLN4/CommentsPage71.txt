Loved it! Classy... 5'7 215 ordered Large/


I just received this item and I absolutely hate it. It came out the package extremely wrinkled, with little stains, and the breast pads are extremely small and noticeable.


Love the material. I'm 5ft 8in 180 pounds and large fits loosely, it is wearable but prefer to adjust the dress a bit


It came quick and it looked really nice on  .. so happy with my purchase I use it for a wedding. I recommend it for curvy girls.  The only thing to look out for it comes a lil big


Sexy dress material is great just hadabit of issues it staying off the shoulders.


Cheap material and fit was very odd through upper bust area.  Hard underwire at chest sticks out in the front.  Flattering fit throughout torso and length was good but ruined by cut and fit in bust area.


My dress came as expected, and fit perfectly!  I will definitely order from this company again.
