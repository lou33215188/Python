I purchased a large for a wedding and it fits perfectly. I recommend this product.


Nice material didnâ€™t like the silver zipper and tight shoulders but itâ€™s a great looking dress


I loved this dress. I bought it for my civil court wedding ğŸ˜œ.i know it might seem too sexy but hey.  I bought it a large and tailored to my body to make sure it was a perfect fit. Itâ€™s true to size. The material is stretchy. The fabric is pretty thick. Only think I would say bad about it was that the zipper is cheap. It can honestly break if your not gentle.


Kind of cute!  Top part of dress, particularly where the arms are, does not fit well at all!  The making of the dress is just cheezy!


Sexy is how you feel & all my boyfriend could say when I put this baby on. He immediately teased that I couldn't wear it unless I'm out with him. One of those kidding, not kidding moments. Worth the buy ladies, very cute date night dress.


The design is very cute. Zipper and seams are on the cheaper quality but what do you expect for the cost of the dress ? It is a very nice dress still.


I received the dress in a timely manner, but it was nothing like the picture. I have this exact dress in black, and I absolutely love it! The material isnâ€™t the same, the area right below your butt was busting at the seam. I purchased my black dress in an XL, and the white one in a XXL. The fitting wasnâ€™t bad, just the overall material and design was wayy off.


I had to return it because the sewn in breast pads were mispositioned making the top part of the dress fit badly.


I ORDERED AN OFF THE SHOULDER DRESS AND GOT A DRESS WITH SLEEVES. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!


I absolutely love this dress! The  material is great quality, better then what I was expecting. I bought the small; It's just a tad too big. But Nothing a little  alteration can't fix!:) I'm very satisfied with the dress!
