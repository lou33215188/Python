I ordered a larger size and that was the right choice.  This dress runs small. Pretty dress though!!!


Color very rich looks great with tangerine lipstick nice fit


very nice the fabric is not clingy or thin...will buy again


I love this dress! It fit as expected, so I didn't have to guess and order another size. I don't know about others, but I was unable to wear a bra with the dress due to the depth of the neckline. I read some reviews saying that the breast pads were weird, but I didn't have an issue with them. They were very thin, not like adding padding for cleavage; and very helpful for me due to the whole not wearing a bra thing. It may be because I ordered the black dress; perhaps the pads are more visible in the lighter colors. I felt sexy and classy at the same time in this dress, which is a big deal to me since I'm not a small girl and hate how most dresses fit. If you are debating buying this dress, just do it, you'll be glad you did!!!


The dress fit perfect and the fabric was stretchy without being too thick or thin.


great product


Great fit great and love the material. Over all great deal for the money.


I like the dress and how it look but sadly I couldn't wear it out for the events.


Beautiful dress, however it was too big around the breast area


Nice dress, very cheap zipper, still needs an strapless bra, or to get taped up,
