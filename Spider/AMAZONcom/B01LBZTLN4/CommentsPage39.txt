Absolutely love this dress. Super cute.


Beautiful dress at a price you can't beat and made of a nice fabric not thin and flimsy.


Love this dress. Love the fit. Going to order the black one nect


This looks pretty in pics but is too big. Will be returning.


If you wife is well endowed, this is wildly sexy.  We love it.


It a body fit dress so if you would like a lose fit get it bigger size. One thing I didn't like about it was the zipper


Love the dress ran big got a medium my size dress fit loose beast v stuck out nice fabric will order again


Oddly constructed, doesn't seem as if it's sewn properly. It will not lay correctly across the shoulders.


If there was a negative star I would give it to this item! horrible material! Just sad
