Loved the dress, got so many compliments. The zipper is look kind of low quality but it's not an expensive dress so what can you expect. Other than that great buy!


I loved it! If your stomach area isn't super small. Please ensure you have on the proper shapewear. I have a small back, big bust hips and bottom area and the dress fit great! I ordered a large.


Love this dress.. Soooo many compliments... 185lb ordered a large and it fit well.. Maybe could have got away with a medium but I have a DD breast size so not sure if a med would have worked.. I didnt have to wear a bra with it and it still looked perky and great...Over all loved the dress may get it in another color as well

Ordered a medium instead of small for my sister who is slim so she had to do a little alteration.


Great dress ğŸ‘— for the price ğŸ’µ and it arrived on time.


Highly recommended!!


This dress was very fashionable and I loved it!!! It was comfortable and very well made. I didn't feel restricted because of the arms.


Beautifully done. Material is perfect, not thin or too thick. This will be my go to dress for the many holiday parties. Form fitting and classy.


This dress came earlier than I expected, good material fit as expected, just as the picture. However the stitching was all wrong, the off the shoulder was stitched poorly, it was not flat on the arm, it was as tho it was tangled.....


Beautiful dress but i find that the wiring at the top keep sticking up the top was the problem


Dress was beautiful... fitting was great... usually wear a 2x but brought a 1x based on reviews and still had enough room


Loved this dress....on somebody else. Not good for a curvy girl. I sent it back with no problem.
