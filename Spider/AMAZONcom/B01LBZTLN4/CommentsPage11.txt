Love the dress..my boobs are all ou..lots if compliment...I order a larger..40 D breast size ..material super thick ..zipper is a lil weak...same as pic..ğŸ˜�ğŸ˜�


I wear XL/1X normally. I am a 14/16 - 5'6" 180lbs. This is cut small. You have to size 1-2 sizes for it not to show all of your inperfections. I don't like my clothes to feel or look tooooo tight. I am curvy like the photo. I do have a little stomach. The only reason it was returned is because the medal piece in the front "V" didn't fit me well.


Purchased this for my daughter to attend a wedding, she was sexy AF!!!


First I would like to say the dress came super fast, I picked standard shipping the process said 5 days && it came in 1 day. Secondly , I was so afraid when ordering this dress because as pictured most of the women pictured our larger women with big Breast and Booties, I am so glad I got the dress thought OMG ..


I AM A SIZE SMALL IN DRESSES . THE MATERIAL WAS THICK && STRECHY. THE TOP OF THE DRESS FITS LIKE I GLOVE, HOWEVER IF YOU ARE A LITTLE SLIMMER ON THE BOTTOM YOU MIGHT WANT YO GET IT ALTERED. IT WASNT A  DRASTIC BIG BUT IF YOU DONT LIKE LOOSE ON THE BOTTOM YOU'LL UNDERSTAND . I DID GET THE DRESS ALTERED ON THE BOTTOM TO FIT TIGHTER && HONEY WHEN I SAY EVERY LAST PENNY I SPENT ON THIS DRESS WAS WORTH IT . I MEAN IT !! WELL PUT TOGETHER DRESS


I love â�¤ï¸� this dress ! I received so many compliments . The only issue is the gathering in the back near the zipper !! But be fab and enjoy it !!!


Love this dress!!!


I have been saving this dress on my wishlist seems like forever. I finally decided to order it for a 50th Masquerade party that I attended. Let me tell you nothing but compliments all the way around. If I must say so myself I looked amazing. You can not go wrong with this dress it is even better in person. Iâ€™m planning on ordering the pink & white. Iâ€™m about 154 lbs height 5â€™2 and I order a medium. Hope this helps.


This dress is beautiful, comfortable and fits perfectly. If youâ€™re looking to add a little black dress to your wardrobe get this one!


Iâ€™m 5â€™5, 150lbs and wear an 8 (NY & Co and Calvin Klein). I bought a size medium and the dress hits me slightly below the knee.


Honestly, I was very excited that my dress was arriving and expected it in time to wear for my event happening that day. I knew it was of quality because I bought one in red and the other and black. It looks classy, feels amazing, and the compliments keep coming. Buttttttt, this burgundy one that I ordered just did not live up to the same expectations that the others did. I opened the packaging and put it on and had a friend try to zip me up, but the zipper was not moving..it moved 2 inches then it started unzipping from the bottom. i was devastated because now no dress and I had to find a replacement and was overall late. Just my luck I guess. Returning this ASAP.


The dress is ok. The zipper in the back makes it look cheap. It's practically and industrial size zipper sewn into a dress. The part that goes over your arms doesn't lay well. It bunches up but might work on a full figured woman. It has a better chance of not bunching when stretched otherwise it's just bunches up. Would NOT recommend you buy if you are below a size 8. All the ladies in the pics look beautiful!
