There is an awkward seam around the mid section. I got it in white so it’s hard to not notice. I haven’t worn it out since my boyfriend and I both agree it looks unflattering.


I ordered a white dress ..I received my package the dress came dirty as hell in the package I’m very disappointed with this purchasalso it doesn’t fit or looks like the dress that I ordered e..because I order off of amazon all the time


This was too big for me, so I had to alter it but once I did, it looked great! I wore it to a wedding and everyone loved it!


I am 6 months pregnant and this dress fits my bump very well but for those looking for a form fitted dress I would suggest going down one size.


We ordered this dress for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved it on her. She looked amazing.


The metal piece making the V in the front poke through the material didn't get wear it out but it was a nice design and very sexy...


Waiting on the right place to where it.


This dress fit super cute! I order my normal size which was a large. I’m 5’4 and about 198lbs. The zipper is on the outside but it does not take away from the dress.


Very gorgeous dress! So slimming and sleek. I am definitely in love with this dress, can't wait to wear it out! Well worth the money, and very quick shipping.


Great dress
