Absolutely gorgeous dress


I order this dress for my daughter as she wish. Unfortunately the material was not what she expected nor did the dress fit to please her.


The fabric on this dress was hideous. It is still in the package. Trying to find someone to give it away to because I will never wear it.


Love Love Love this dress! I have small breast and wide, sent from an angel, hips! Fits deliciously!


looked a bit cheap for my taste, wearable nontheless


I love it! I'm pregnant and it fit perfect. Very stretchy I say buy your normal dress size and it should be ok.


I am 5'3, 146lbs and 36C cup. The material is thick, which is a plus. Therefore you don't need a slip underneath. I ordered a medium, which fits OK with the exception of my breast. It was too loose. The dress was very wrinkle. I was expecting to wear for a ceremony but overall was not pleased. I will be giving the dress away.


I turned heads in this dress!


Love this dress got it in a large but I should've got a Med... I was able to put it on without it being unzipped. It was a little loose up top but I made it work...


Cute dress for the price UNTIL I wore it once and it literally fell apart at the seams. Also, the wires in the front that hold the v taute need to be bent in slightly before you wear so your nipples stay hidden. Ok if you're only planning on wearing once.
