Fabulous dress!  The fit was perfect and very comfortable not to mention super sexy!  Thinking of buying in additional colors.


Bought this dress to attend a graduation, the material of the dress is perfect order it in small but it was a bit large did a little alteration and it fits perfectly. The burgundy is a really beautiful colour. #sexy#neat#comfortable. Size- Small  Purchase - 21, 2017  Wore- July 6, 2017

Love this dress.  It fits good. I wear 8/10 so I ordered a medium. The material is nice and thick. People thought it was from a boutique or high end store.


Waiting to wear this beauty fits like a glove !!


Beautiful dress! I love it!


Loved wearing this dress.


The dress is not as sexy as the picture (my opinion) overall, it's a nice dress. I will be wearing something else for an event in which I bought this dress for.
