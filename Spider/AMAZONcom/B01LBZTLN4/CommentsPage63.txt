love the fit


This dress is gorgeous. You will not be disappointed. I am still trying to find a place to wear it.


What I expected and more, really comfortable and fits perfect


Great dress great material,  great cut. Just the size was off for meğŸ˜£.


Love love love this dress!! My only problem with it was that the cup area had a weird fit. The dress  fitted me perfectly but breast area was a little big. Other than that, the dress was beautiful and I received a lot of compliments!


Don't waste your money.  The fit is awful.


Was a good dress just wasnâ€™t what I needed


Wore this dress for my Bday and received a ton of compliments.


I WORE THIS DRESS FOR MY 40TH BIRTHDAY PARTY AND IT WAS A HIT, EVERYONE COMPLAMENTED THE DRESS.
