This dress was not made with a less than favorable material that did not have any give, similar to tapestry. I am 5'10" 210 and order an x-Large in red, the material was shiny like a prom dress and the zipper color was off compared to the material and color of the dress and it was visible.


Also, I returned the item and have not yet received my refund and it has been 30 days


I got so many compliments on this dress. The quality of the material was great. I'm 5'3 138lbs but I'm a D cup. That was my concerned but to my surprise the dress fit perfect.


I love love love this dress. I was worried because I did last minute shopping for something to wear to a wedding. I read the reviews and tried my luck and I'm glad I decided to buy. I am 5'8 at 190lbs and I ordered a xxl and it fits perfect with a enough to for my stomach area and it sucks everything in perfect. I probably could have ordered an xl but I know I like to eat so I didn't want to feel packed in lol... but great dress for the price. It actually looks like it cost more as well


Loved this dress. It fit great without being too tight or revealing. I received lots of compliments. So happy with this purchase. I felt like a million dollars! ğŸ˜�


This dress was great for the i purchased a size M. I'm 5'6.5 156 lbs and busty, not hippy. I had to wear a strapless bra to wrangle myself outward and forward so I did have to fight with the top of the dress all night. But it was comfortable and stretchy and seems easy to clean.


This dress was absolutely amazing and I loved it. I was a little skeptical at first, but I will tell you I was not disappointed. I am wearing a size Medium in the picture.


When I saw the price I was a little sceptical, so I took a chance because if the other reviews, that's why I'm writing one. So when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. Fit well and looked very good on. I wore it to a wedding and received a lot of compliments. I ordered a size M and it fit perfect. I'm 5'3, size C cup and around a size 6/8 in dresses, had a little room in the waste but fit perfect in my lower and upper parts. Recommend this for sure!


Ordered xl, top was too big. Ordered large and dress was too snug. Would recomend if you are a 12 get xl, may need to get top part altered.


Great quality,  sexy dress.


I really LOVE this dress! I orderer a size medium based on the customer reviews and sizing chart. I am 5'9 and 150 pounds. Size 6/7 jeans and 32 D bra. This dress was probably a size too big for me. I will end up taking in the dress myself but it will be so worth it. The top of the dress offers no support for your girls though lol I may sew in some cups too. The fabric is not cheap looking and has a decent amount of stretch, Buy a size smaller so it will hug your body nicely :) All in all- Beautiful dress, great price, and totally worth the work I will put in to make it perfect.


It was a beautiful dress once I got it altered but it was way too big and I ordered a small. I am 5'3 at 119 lbs. It is also a bit risquÃ© in the voob area and I  couldn't quite figure out which brought to pair with it however I ended up going bra less .
