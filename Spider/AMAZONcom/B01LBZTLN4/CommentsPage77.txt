Runs large dress doesnt look like pic very unflattering  very disappointed!


The  most sexiest  dress I've had in my closets in a long time!!!. I would recommend this dress this is a great date night dress.


fits very well.


I love it! I'm 5'8 and wear a size 20 so I got a 2X fits well, i do wish it was just a tad bigger BUT the material is a little stretching so if you have a little extra curve no worries girls


Love, love, LOVE this dress!! It fits every curve perfectly. The color was beautiful, it was so comfortable. I need this dress is black too!!


Itâ€™s pretty but M was too big on my


The chest part was beautiful as for the material of the dress complete garbage not even acceptable to be seen in public with... complete waste of my money


it's an OK dress, ordered the white- not crazy about the material.


It fits great ...it is a Little see through for the white one but I still love it ..


The V wire is a trip. Other than that the dress fits nice.
