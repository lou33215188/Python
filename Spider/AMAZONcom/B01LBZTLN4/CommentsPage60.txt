The fitting to the body is amazing. It fits great and curves my body, however, the color is not the same as the picture. It is more of a maroon color than it is on this photo. Would have given it a 5 star if the color wasn't off.


fast shipping thanks so much I appreciate love my dress fit me well I received a lot of complement thanks recommended for everyone to this seller thanks I will order again


Its actually a nice dress for what you pay. I just had twins so i ordered a xl it fits nice im 5'6 and 200 lbs. It was very comfortable to wear nice thick material. I was very pleased with it.


Very Elegant and sexy dress I wore on a cruise at captains dinner and it fit perfectly


Pretty color. But the wire used to hold the top up was hard to manage. And bent funny.


Good


I love this dress!!! I ordered in four other colors once I got this dress.. I ordered a large and it was a bit too big but gave enough room to still be able to move and breath.


This dress fit perfect. Thinking about ordering in another color


The material on the picture looks nothing like the dress that was mailed to me. The lady in the picture seems to have a more fitted look. I also ordered a red dress and the red was not as vibrant.will not be ordering from this seller again.


Great dress for the price. I wore it to a wedding and got so many compliments. The only thing I would have preferred is, if this had an xs or the small was smaller. I am not too curvy so it fit on the loose side.
