Absolutely stunning!! Fits perfect to my hour glass shape! Looks way more expensive then what the price is... Thank you!


loved the fit but the bust area was falling off, it doesnt fit as expected and the bust area, i think there is a bone/metal in it that lets that area looks weird.


Not bad but not good. Very thin fabric, which everyone seems to be saying how thick it is..maybe I received different fabric. Cute dress but it looks more like a going to the club dress..I was hoping to wear for a work event. Shiny cheap fabric


It was a little looser then it should have been


Unfortunately, they were a bit too small for the intended person. However, I gave them away to someone smaller in body size and the loved them.


Really nice dress for the price. I was very surprised at the fit and quality. I highly recommend. I am a size 12 and ordered a large and it fit perfectly.


Love...love...love...


Love this dress I got it for a wedding and it was a eye catcher..


I still have not worn it. I plan to take it to the cleaners and have it altered to fit me better. I should have gotten a smaller size.


I have this in XL navy blue and I loved it. Lost a little eight so order a Large and the mid section was to big but the rest fit perfectly. I was really disappointed. It definitely didn’t fit nor look good on. But returning to order again and hopefully it’s not the same problem
