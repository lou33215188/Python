Fabric is very nice but the size is off but i didnt return I send to my granddaughter since she's 3 sizes smaller


This dress exceeded my expectations. It fits perfectly. I do see where people were referring to the zipper bulging in the back, but it does not take away from the dress at all. This dress is very sexy and I have no doubt that when I wear it to this event, it will be a show stopper.


Lovley evevnig dress


Great fit!


The right not left sleeve of this dress was sewed improperly it was sewned inside out and did not fit on the shoulders as shown in picture. I was totally disappointed and not the quality that Amazon should associate with. I will be returning this dress back to the seller.


Can't wait to wear it out.


Very pretty dress and great price


Would not buy this dress! It is definitely not anything like shown in the pictures.


Zipper is poor quality. Dress is just OK. It gathers in the back as if it was made incorrectly. Size/fit is true to size.


I absolutely Adore this dress!!
