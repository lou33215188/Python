wore this for my anniversary and got soooo many compliments. Best $20 I have spent in a long time


Liked the dress only thing is I got a xlarge and the bust was really big but fit well every where else.


Too small, too cheap. Not a good look, will be returning.


Perfect fit !!!! Beautiful ğŸ˜�
