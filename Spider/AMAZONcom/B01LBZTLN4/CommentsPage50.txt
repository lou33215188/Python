This dress is amazing! So form-fitting and flattering! Had to use some body tape to make the straps stay, but it was so beautiful. So many compliments! Ps - Youâ€™ll need a great strapless with deep plunge. Trust me youâ€™ll thank me!


I am hesitant to buy new brands online since I never know if they will fit my body right, this was a winner! Not cheaply made, looks amazing and hugs my curves! Love it!


Perfectly fit. Long enough 2 inch below my knee and i'm 5'6.


Fits perfect, looks really good on. I was afraid at first of if it would come as advertised, and when it came it definitely was exactly as shown. The only problem I have the zipper appears kind of cheap when your zipping the dress. Other than that, not a bad buy at all!


I wore this dress to a wedding and it was a hit!


Cheap, I gave it away


Ordered a large. Perfect fit! Good material


Looked amazing!


I was stunning it.


It wasnâ€™t what I need it to be
