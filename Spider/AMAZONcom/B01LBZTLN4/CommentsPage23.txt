Its ok. the front "ribs" for your boobs are weird and do not lay flat, they pop out at the top which gives this weird look to the dress.


Bought a 16 I should’ve bought my true size 14. It’s cute but not for my wedding. The breast pads are weird otherwise good.


I love this dress!! I wore it to a Captain's dinner on a cruise and received so many compliments. I ordered and extra large. I'm 5"4 224 pounds.


The M was to tight  around the hips but fit bust perfect. The L  was good at hips but a little big in bust. . I'm 5ft 7 in and have an hourglass body type.


Fit as expected for the price it was. Daughter wore it too prom. Zipper not the best quality, but for 1 time use..it's perfect.


Great dress! I'm 5'1" 130 lbs and the Medium fit very well. The zipper bunched a bit in the back, but it was still very flattering. I wore it to a pre-wedding event and received a ton of compliments. Will probably be ordering it in some additional colors.


I think I accidently ordered a size small (I usually wear a medium) but the dress slipped on perfectly, which was surprising. One thing that I disliked was a malfunction with the zipper so I was unable to completely zip the dress back down while taking it off. The dress is still beautiful and a nice fit.


Did not fit. Was not the material I expected. I would suggest ordering a size down.  Material was not what I expected.


Really cute!!


Really cute dress but I should have purchased a Medium. I'm 5'7" and 145. I will have to get this dress altered to fit me better.
