I love this dress, fit all my curves and my hubby absolutely loved it!!


Little upset that i ordered Black and got a dark blue dress but the package said Black. Itâ€™s still cute but yeah itâ€™s kinda misleading


love it


The dress fit very nicely. However, I  didn't like the placement of breast pads. Also, there was some loose thread other than that the dress was perfect.


Material is ruff . Bad quality


Love it.ğŸ’šğŸ’šğŸ’šğŸ’š so beautiful


Gorgeous dress, my only issue is that it had a small rip near the sleeve area, but I will repair it myself.  I like the fit and the look.


Unfortunately I had to send it back because it droop on the arms and so it did not look good on me but, its a nice dress.


I purchased a large even though I could fit it ....I would have went a size up to a x large its fits good to the body ..  Be careful  if you arms are big it might be a tight fit in the sleeve.


The dress was beautiful, just a smidgen big in the bust area. Just put in some tacks under the arms and it was perfect! Colour was perfect, length and fit in other areas too and I'm 5'11" @ 230lbs
