This dress is super snug, a pin up girls dream. Doesnt hide undergarments well- you can see through the fabric. As a result, dont be someone who prefers lots of shapewear.


The front cut is DEEP. It shows tons of inner boob. The dress has amazing lift and support though- those babies look GOOD. It would be great for a photo shoot or something exotic for sure. Not anywhere modest or a family thing... you’ll have boob everywhere.


i LOVE IT.


5’7 and 160 and it’s like a fitting glove, definitely not a dress you can hide trouble spots. I was able to wear a full body piece of shapewear with a thong bottom and I could probably get away with it in a darker environment- you see every line or crease.


So great though!


The material was perfect. As a plus size woman, I can say that I like how it hugs the body.


Love it... im 5'8 fits perfect


This dress isn't for a busty lady.


when i tried it on the zipper broke that was the only down fall, but it was fixed and it fits beautifully


I absolutely love this dress!  I got so many compliments on it!  I added it to my favorite dresses.


Good quality very nice!


Oh my gooodness!! I bought this for my birthday night and I am so excited to wear it!! It fits BEAUTIFULLY!!


Good material and beautiful dress. I just got the wrong size


Didn't Like the V-Part in the Front the wire was bent
