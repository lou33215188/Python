I’ve been ordering size M lately in other dresses but the M fit too big as sleeves were falling off, the V on the front was falling forward and too loose around the body. A small probably would have fit a lot better.


5’4” 135lbs


very beautiful


It is very pretty but it definitely runs large I believe I ordered a 1x I could of ordered a large that's how huge the top part of the dress is. But it would of been a great dress if it was the right size


Great material love dress I just didn't pick my correct size I took a medium cause that's my size but this medium is bigger but dress is lovely


Too large. Had to send back :-( material ok.


Love it!


PERFECT I LOVE IT!! I really picky about my clothes and the material, but this is sooo perfect. Can't wait to wear it next weekend for a wedding I'm attending.!!!


I loved the color just like the picture and the length was great. The padding for breast isn’t the best. Need a good suction style support to hold them up. Very clingy so going up to a XL would have been better for me personally.


Dress is just as advertised... fits perfectly, love it n


Dress was not burgundy it was purple
