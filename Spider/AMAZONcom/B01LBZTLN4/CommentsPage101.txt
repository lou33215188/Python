the center piece was way off, open to wide,poor quality


I am happy with product


It is a bit too big but can be fixed with proper adjustments


Ordered a black dress and received a dark purple dress. Dress is cute.


The dress gave a nice fit. However I had to do alterations as it ran a little big for me. Good value for money though


Was made NOTHING like pictured. The front is totally different


Love it


Dress was beautiful on! Comfortable and I felt sexy in it!!!


gorgeous Very Sexy and well made. Looks and feels like a $500.00 dress....


Zipper issue. Would open in the middle randomly while zipped.
