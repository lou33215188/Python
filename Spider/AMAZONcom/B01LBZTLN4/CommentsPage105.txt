Hugs all the right places


Did look like what's in the picture totally different


The dress makes me feel tiny!


The dress was perfect only thing I didn't like was the wire on the breast that makes the deep V.


Nothing like the picture


Very pretty dress, just too small for me.


Received sooooo many compliments wearing this dress


It's okay, size was a bit smaller though. The color and material was nice however.


Zipper came broke... Otherwise the dress fit fine.


I love everything about this dress, it sexy, it fix me perfectly
