This dress is an amazing for the price. Its a most have dress it up or down. You will definitely turn heads with this dress on.


Very nice dress. The only thing I do not like are the breast pads in the dress. They donâ€™t form properly. Other than that is a beautiful dress


was a perfect dress,  there is a silver zipper up the back, which the picture doesn't show... but very flattering!


I love it, it was exactly as pictured & fit perfectly!


Returned cause metal bars poked out and broke the seams. But I received a full refund and free returns. It fit well when I got it but maybe too long.


Fits pretty good but CHEAP CHEAP material
