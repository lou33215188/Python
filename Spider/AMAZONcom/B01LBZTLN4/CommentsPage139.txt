I ordered this dress for my baby shower and it fit perfect! I was 7 months pregnant and ordered a medium. The material was thick unlike some white dresses that are thin and see through. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.


This dress is a thick material that holds in problem areas like belly fat. I look so snatched in this dress! With proper undergarments I'll be flawless ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�¾


I'll be sure to upload pics


This dress is very lovely. I never regret buying it at all..


My best friend bought this for me as a gift to wear to a party.  Soooooo beautiful fits perfectly.  I'm a 10 in pants and bought a large to be safe (because of my hips and butt). I could have ordered a medium though.  Great quality.


Love this dress. Got a lot of compliments. Only issue I had was the top part fit a little weird.  4.5 stars is what I would really give


This dress right here babyyyy, it's everything!! I received so many compliments on it. I wore it to a wedding and was ready. I am a size 14/16 in top and bottom and I ordered a XL. If you looking for a show stopper this is it!!!


Beautiful dress, great material. I am 5'4' 230 lbs and the XL dress fit me perfect. my jean size is 16 if that helps.


9.mths pregnant and rocking this dress.  Bought this on a limb, bcuz of the free return policy... man I did not regret this decision.  Absolutely loved the fabric, color, fit and length. Highly recommend. Made me feel sexy and classy at the same time..


I didn't like this dress at all... The dress looked too cheap for my liking. Fabric, poor quality zipper, the overall stitching all not done well. I guess what would you expect for the price. Looked nothing like picture. Very disappointed. Maybe ok for cheap school girl dress. Couldn't give zero stars.


One of the sexiest yet classy dresses I've owned. Wore it to a wedding and got a ton of compliments. Bigger girl. Hugs in all the right places.
