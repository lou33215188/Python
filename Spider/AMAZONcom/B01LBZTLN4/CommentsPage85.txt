This dress is really cute but the zipper is horrible.  I will have to take it to get another put in.


Very beautiful dress happy with product


I bought this dress for date night,and it looks and fit great.


Very cute


I'm a 36B so the top part is a little big. Overall I love the quality it great.


This dress would have probably been nice, however, I received this dress with a broken zip. Returning immediately.


The size was off. Fabric seems very cheap it didn't really hold any part of me I'm a true large in size materials was just cheap


Perfect dresss I love the way it fit my body.


I love this dress. It was prefect fit. I wear 12 or 14 dresses and I am 5'8. This by far is the best dress I have purchased on .


Perfect dress and the material is very comfortable. I didn't wear it off the shoulders because the design is flawed a little or irregular I guess
