Cute dress with a lot of stretch. Material pretty good. Issue was the placement of the bra pads and that they could not be removed. The pads are oddly placed and you cant seem to move them at all.


I loved the dress it was truly a hit. I'm a 36DD an a size 12. So the XL was a comfortable fit for me. I read the other reviews about removing the pads out of the bust area and once I did I had a smoother apperence.


I ordered this dress in 2 sizes. Xlarge and 2xlarge. It's a big difference in the sizes. Xlarge was a great fit. BUT the dress was made horribly.  The wire in the front was coming out. And the back do not lay flat. So I tried on the 2x and it fits like a shirt. Very disappointed because it's a very pretty dress


Absolutely loved this dress .... I ordered a large felt comfy all night ... I felt so sexy an got so many compliments


I love this dress. Bought it for a cruise. It fits perfectly and the material is gr2at quality


Fit was fine but seams showed through the fabric.  Returned it for the black one, that looked great!


I was worried about the boob area initially but ended up working out great.  Soft and stretchy great fit!


I really liked this dress for ladies with bigger boobs keep in mind that it has breast pads and it can look strange. But super cute dress.


This dress is very see through. It’s cute but the size chart is NOT ACCURATE. I got a Medium and it’s the size of a large. I’m VERY DISAPPOINTED.  This dress honestly had so much potential and I really needed it for a formal function. It was ill fitting and made me feel uncomfortable that it would fall off at anytime. Please fix your product.


This dress does not fit right. Especially in the boobs area. And it has some weird cushion in it
