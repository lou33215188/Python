I like the dress however, the bust area is a little big


Got it in black for my 30th Bday Beautiful dress beautiful fit compliments curves I'm a happy buyer will be getting this in white too


Perfect!


Love it!  Fit perfectly.


The zipper is hard to zip and came off track. I took it to a alteration shop and had the zipper replaced


Nice! It fits in the hip area well... my only concern is in the bust/chest area. The great thing is the straps allows different styles.


Not a fan of the material, but is a very nice dress


The dress is extremely comfortable! I like the material


Beautiful dress. Fits to big around the breast. I normally wear size 6-8in dresses i had gotten a med.


I absolutely love the dress it fit me like a glove!!!
