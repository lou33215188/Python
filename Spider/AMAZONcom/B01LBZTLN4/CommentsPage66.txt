Good


This dress was a great find for the price. I'm a XXL because of my bodacious 38F boobs. I can wear a size 10-12 bottoms and my shrinking waist.  For the extra dollars, it's worth the seamstress alterations.


It fit perfectly I love this dress


perfect......quality nice


Really nice the quality was better than expected.  The front where the cleavage is what the pictures shows. Overall nice dress.


I ordered the pink dress but its actually peach. The dress fit perfectly except in the boob area. Im 5'3 145lbs and it hugged every curve ğŸ‘Œ.  If you have a good strapless bra or top heavy I would defiantly recommend .


This dress is simply amazing, the material is very thick and itâ€™s a good fit. I love it so much ğŸ˜�â�¤ï¸�ğŸ˜�


Fits well but cheaply made.  Would never be caught dead wearing this poorly made material and craftsmanship.


I normally wear a large so I order a large and it a little too big. I didn't wear it because the padding in the breast wasn't comfortable. But it was ok


I received my dress over the Labor Day weekend and I am just now trying it on and I absolutely love it!!!!! Fits great I am 6ft and 250 pounds and I ordered an XXL. Fits larger in the boob area but I expected that... Great Product
