I am 5ft 9" and i bought the large, it fits but it was a little roomy for me, I could have gotten a medium. The length is just right, it is a little below my knees. The material is of good quality. I haven't worn it as yet but i would recommend it!


Perfection!.......and more that what i expected for the price


Cheap quality it was like a haloween costume material zipper very cheap quality! Garbage would be a compliment


I love this dress, the men love this dress, everybody love this dress. If you have the right curves this dress is fabulous for the price.


Love it but is it a lil big


This is not a dark blue. It's a dark purple.


So how do I get the right coloured dress????


Absolutely gorgeous dress for the price. I ordered true to size, but should be ordered 1 size larger. It still fit and hid many imperfections, but I would've been more comfortable with it looser


I think I should have ordered a size bigger. It fits very snug.


super cute and sexy


This dress has padding in the bust area that is extremely visible. Also, wouldn't recommend ordering this dress if you are slim, the smallest size is still too large.
