Rerunes item, too small not good for curvy figure


Product was torn below zipper before I had a chance to try it on


This dress made me feel like a million bucks! Worth every penny! If you're on the fence BUY THIS DRESS!


I love it and will be ordering at least 2 more !! It is really an all purpose dress.... lol also thinking about buying one for my bestfriend ğŸ˜‰


Ordered a small, it fit like a large on me. The material is nice for the price I paid, but saddened I need to take it to a shop in order to wear it.


Fits great!


Size fits as expected!!!


Beautiful dress!!! But it doesn't fit well in the bust area. Might make a return for it because since it to big I haven't worn it.


The dress fit perfectly, However, one sleeve was sewn on incorrectly which made it twisted on the arm instead of flat.
