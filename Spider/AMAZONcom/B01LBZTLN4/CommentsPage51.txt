Bright this for my niece to wear to a wedding loved it


Looks cheaply made.... Was not satisfied.... Even after going by the measurements for this dress. The off the shoulder and bust doesn't fit like the picture.


This item was very well made, fit exactly as I thought it would. The price was great and it arrived on time. Wore it to a wedding and everyone loved it.


sent it back and was replaced with no problems.


Pretty dress. Nice material. Dress came with small hole with the wire sticking out of the cleavage area. Im 5'3 148lbs and got a small. I'm a 34DDD and the dress fit well. Zipper sticks. I had to zip it up first then stepped into it.


True to size the dress also had some stretch to it I loved it. I just didn't like how the straps kept coming up that's it, and it came fast.


Too hot! My body can't breathe! The fabric colour for burgundy looks purple. I bought this for an evening beach dinner party... this is not made for Summer/ Fall like attire. It's HOT! I am 5'10 and ordered XXL I weight 210 and still not enough airway.


I originally ordered a medium instead of listening to the reviews and failed. I had to send the medium back and ordered a small which fit perfectly! I loved the dress and I received a lot of compliments. I wore it for my graduation.


BEAUTIFUL, BUT SMALLER THEN WHAT IT WAS... NOW I HAVE TO MAKE WIFE LOOSE WEIGHT!!!


The dress looks great online but there is a huge metal v stitched on the plunging v part of the dress. When you put it on it very prominent and uncomfortable to your breast.
