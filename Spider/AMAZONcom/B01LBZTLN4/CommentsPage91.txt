Love!


Cute dress, but not for me. Material too thin, see through.


Loooooove this dress.


I love the dress!! It fits comfortably and came just in time for my anniversary!!


Dress fits but it's a little tight in the back. A medium would have been perfect.


It fits perfectly, and looks beautiful on. The only down fall is I ordered it to wear to a wedding and half way through the reception the wire from the v neck started to come out on both sides.


Size fit perfect, dress looked great. The zipper seemed a bit low quality, but havent had any issues with it. I recommend it!


This dress is Beautiful!  Fits perfectly. Looks much better in person.  Can't wait to wear it.


The dress is so elegant.i really love it and fit so nice.


Very stretchy
