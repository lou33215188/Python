WORED it to the Kem Valentine's concert and my fiance looooove it!!!! Ladies get this dress!!!! It's very fitted..u will not be disappointed..gonna order in other colors


Nice but no support in chest area. Unless you are enhanced you will need a bra


Absolutely in love with this dress. It's true to size. I'm 5'11, about 225, normally an XL. I purchased the XXL just to be safe and it's a bit loose but still comfy, classic looking and perfect for a curvy figure.


Love the dress but the material is not the same and the color is way off.... I thought this was Burgundy but it was actually a really dark purple.


i had to return because it was too thin, you can see everything though this dress.


Love the material and fit  .


the dress is beautiful I bought too sizes,,the large was too large,,I would recommend it.


I love this dress.  Very sexy.  I am saving to wear to a wedding.  I am 5'4 and 125 pound and ordered a small.


I bought this dress and wore it on a cruise a few weeks ago. I got so many compliments! No girdle/spanx needed. Iâ€™m a plus size woman and this dress fit just as I expected, except for the breast area. I was showing a LOT of cleavage. Still a great purchase.


i'm a US 14/16 with 36DD . I purchased an XXL based on previous reviews and it was too loose on me. however the material was very nice and fit well once i made some adjustments at my seamstress. great quality material not cheap looking at all for the price.
