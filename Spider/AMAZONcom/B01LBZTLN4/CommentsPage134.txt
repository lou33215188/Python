Cheap material, even cheaper zipper.


Zipper was broken


Very beautiful dress (the material is satin like). Too bad it was too tight around the body and too large in the breast area.  Unfortunately I will be sending this back.


Update:


I lost 29 pounds and ordered the dark blue one this time. OMG it's gorgeous and fits perfectly!!


So I was pleasantly surprised by this dress! It fits nicely and is extremely flattering. Classy but sexy. I have gained 28 pounds these past two years but am more determined than ever to lose it now. However, this dress is perfect for me


Now until I lose the weight! Just fwy I'm 5'7 1/2, 180 pounds. This pic is not


Edited. This is how flattering this is


Poor quality


I was surprised  great quality for dress. Zipper a little  cheaper.  Fit a little too big but overall was nice I wore it to my masquerade  ball.


Didn't like the Fabric, dress wasn't what I expected. Appeared and looked homemade.


Love the dress the sleeves annoyed me all night because they are not tight enough to stay in place . But I loved it!


Love the dress but too small.


I was serving all night! Bought this dress for a wedding. I thought it was a good balance btw classy and sexy. Iâ€™m like 5â€™6â€�/7â€� and about 175 lbs (+-5 during that time of the month) and have little to no tits. I listened to the reviews and ordered a size down from what I usually get, so I ordered a medium. Some people said it was a little big, and I wanted this to fit me like a glove. Also if it was bigger than it needed to be, the top portion was going to be a problem seeing as I have no boobs to hold this dress in place! ğŸ¤£ any way it fit great, the fabric is thick and stretchy (reminds me of scuba material) so my underwear didnâ€™t show. I also bought a bra that helped me conceal my nipples if the dress where to expose more than I wanted. I reviewed that also, should be on my reviewer profile
