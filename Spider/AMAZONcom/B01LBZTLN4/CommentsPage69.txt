Didnâ€™t like the fact that the shoulders fell off and do not stay on. I felt like the dress would fall off of me if I moved too much.


i don't feel that this dress lived up to its description before my purchase. its too big and I don't like the material


LOVE IT


Loved the way it contoured my body.  It was a comfortable beautiful black dress


oh my gosh i am slender and this dress was perfect fit so well. I looked so glamorous when i wore it to a work event.


Loved it!! but just be aware that the cleavage dips lower than expected in front


The "V" is a little different,,  not sure,,,,  will keep for the price, but will have to workout something with that "V"  my 36(C) may be part of the problem!!!!!


Beautiful fit!


Beautiful dress...

 I am 5'3 170 have full body curves. I got a large however I am a little top heavy I could have gone up to XL.
