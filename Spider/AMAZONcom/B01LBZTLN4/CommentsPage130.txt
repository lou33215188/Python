I bought a size small. Too tight. Hard to zipper. I recommend going up in a size. I returned mine. Other than that, nice material and looks like the picture.


Beautiful Dress with a great price


This dress was purchased in a medium and it fit perfect. I wish the wire part at the V is to hard other than that I love it â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�â�¤ï¸�


The dress flights snug but comfortably.  The back zipper gets stuck very quick so be careful with zippering up.  The 'v' plunge area goes down lower than expected so definitely wear a low plunge bra.  I'm 5'10 and the dress reached at my knees. I ordered a medium but would probably be able to fit a small.


Like was super tiny. Couldn't even pull it on.  I'm a 14/16 and ordered the XXL was smaller than a small. Cheap fabric


Very good dress for the price. It comes with bra. Very convenient


I love it ğŸ˜�


Typically an XL but got the 3XL and it was still kinda snug. Unfortunately I had a lot of boob spilling out and have to return it.


It's too small . I don't like .


I received this item today very beautiful dress however the dress was too big and arrived dirty very disappointed should've ordered a large...
