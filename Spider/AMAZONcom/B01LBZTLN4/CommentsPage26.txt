It is true to size. I am 180 and 5"7 . I got a large and I had a little extra room. Great dress for weddings


I'm 5'8 weight 220 pounds an a xl fit me perfet  I think it's bcs the size run bigger  I would defiantly  buy it again great material.


It's a very cute dress.. I'm 165lbs i ordered a med. love tht fit but soon as I tried the dress on the zipper split... I couldn't repair it.. had to send it back...


Love this dress, got a ton of compliments. Only downside is the fabric did pull a little after the first wear.


i normally wear a 2x it was baggy on me. the straps are almost for another dress dont like how they hang and the v in the chest sticks out weird. should have ordered a size smaller


Sexy and Classy! Perfect!  Thank you! Better than pics!!!! Excellent! There is a metal wire so the V can not be adjusted.  I am 5'9" and it falls an inch below my knee. Great for hourglass shape. Runs Large.


Nicely, snug fitted dress.  only downfall is the Zipper in back (metal with no smoothness) is a bit rough & difficult to zip up


The dress is super sexy. It definitely was on the larger side .it has Alot of stretch. I had to get it altered and still I struggled with the sleeves all night and that bone for the cleavage made me crazy. But generally it was absolutely beautiful


I was nervous and skeptical about ordering clothes on amazon but to my surprise this was definitely a good purchase.This dress was perfect I weigh 148 I ordered a medium first but it was a little loose so I reordered the dress and got a small and it fitted perfectly....If anyone is thinking of getting this dress go right ahead get it. The zipper is a lil funky but once it's zipped your good.


Cute dresses purchase a extra large. 230lb size size 16-18. Should have got another color the white shows everything .  Especially your pouch.. overall I think it's a great dress for the price. If your in shape I would definitely buy it.
