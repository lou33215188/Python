Nice dress for the price. A little large in the bust area. Im 5â€™2 235lbs with hips and small breast. The xl was too big.


Good for a bustier women. i'm think in the hips but lack in the chest area. Fits great otherwise.


Wore this when I graduated college! Nice fit!


I turned heads all night in this number.


Fit as expected but not the breast part


Love it!!! Perfect fit, and extremely flattering dress! Exactly what I was looking for! Very satisfied! Thanks


Looked like a Queen!


I love this dress!!! Fits great!!!


Cute dress but to tight around the middle for me.


Just was okay. Quality not the greatest and the breast area is a little off. I am going to need to have it altered a bit to make it fit properly in the bust area.
