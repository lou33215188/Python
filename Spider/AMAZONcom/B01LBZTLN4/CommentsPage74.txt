Great dress !!!!  Loved it!!!


Very nice for the price! Comfortable and sizing was correct.


Love it!


This didnâ€™t come in any way, shape or form as that dress in the pic. The zipper is broken, not the right color, and I canâ€™t find where my arms go. Iâ€™m returning it for my refund.


This dress is really nice but I don't really like how it fits me personally !! But if you have big boobs don't worry because iwith this dress it wouldn't be the problem .


I love this dress comfortable and sexy! I received a lot of compliments on this dress!


I absolutely LOVED this dress... Very sexy tho. The only thing that I didn't like was it didn't stay on my shoulders like I would have liked, but other than that, it was a hit. I received so many compliments.


Fast shipping! Super cuteğŸ’›


The fabric was cheap and the stitching followed the same cheap trend. I returned it but it fit as expected and I'm sure someone would love it.


the photo looks better in person.I like the style though
