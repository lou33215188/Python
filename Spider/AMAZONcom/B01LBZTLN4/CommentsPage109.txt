Fits in all the right places ğŸ‘ŒğŸ�¾ I love it and can't wait to wear it on my cruise. I will post picsğŸ˜Š


As pictured, I'm 5'5 & 190lb I ordered a L and it fit perfectly.


Love the dress! I'm always in between a medium and a large since im busty. Went with a medium it fit like a glove and wasn't overexposed!


sleek and sophisticated.


Fits well and very nice dress


Love this dress got so many compliments on it


This dress was everything!!! Size XXL


The quality was garbage.  It did not fit as expected, the cut for the v-neck has a funny metal bit inside.


Return want to purchase another size


Love the dress just not the bra part
