Bust area too small and weirdly shaped. I am a curvy woman but this seems to be for someone with modest curves which it will enhance.


OMG! I love love loved it! It fit great the zipper was a little difficult but good.


I wear a size 20 in jeans and my breasts are a size 42G. I got this dress in the size 2X and it fit perfectly! Hit all my curves just right and made me feel so damn sexy!


I love the way it fit ,not only  that itâ€™s really nice ğŸ‘�ğŸ�¼ to wear to go to dinner . I gave it a 4 star â­�ï¸� Be cause the only thing I donâ€™t donâ€™t like is the zipper but beside that itâ€™s a nice dress


It arrive a day early


The reviews said it's true to size but I ordered a size up...i will be exchanging


Loved the dress material looked and felt like high quality but there is a massive down side to this dress The zipper.  I realIy liked it and i was looking forward to wearing it but when  tried it on and when I zipped it up it went like this.....â¬†ï¸�â¬†ï¸�â¬†ï¸�


Material is a unique blend however dress is really nice on. Fits curves appropriately. Must handwash otherwise material will pull/ change. There is no label with care instructions which is why I mentioned how to care for item.


This dress is great!!!


This dress is not the dress that is on the picture. The material is different and very cheap, and the zip on the dress is flimsy. The dress looks nothing like the advertised dress on the picture.


Boning is not good. Not quite stable enough to hold up your breast. Front V is too wide.
