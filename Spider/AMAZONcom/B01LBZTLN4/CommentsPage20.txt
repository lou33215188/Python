An amazing fit, I'm 5 7' and I'm 230 I got the xl I could have gone down a size to get a really close fit. I almost bought xxl. The only disadvantage was I had to be fixing the shoulder but it was worth it. It's exactly as pictured. If you are under 260lb do not buy a xxl your gonna regret it. If you are in the 230-250 range with a flat stomach get a large. Cause my dress had room


Nice dress. Great fabric. Good quality. I would maybe size down when ordering-- for me the bust fit and kinda the hips the middle however was baggy. My measurnents are 38-28-41 and although it fit well in most areas I didn't wanna pay $30 in alterations to a $21 dress. That's just me though.


Part of the wire came out at the top. I brought it for a bridal shower and didn't have time to return it. Poorly stitched, but is a cute dress.


Omgness I LOVE THIS DRESS! I wore it to a wedding and I looked so beautiful! I brought an XL but come to find out I was able to wear a M. The L & XL was too big! I'm 5'7 1/2 weight is 190.


I love the dress but a little awkward because I purchased the dress a size larger because I have extra space at the top but it's too big at the top. I love that it isn't really tight. I'm going to have it tailored for another occasion.


Just received this dress and it fits perfect other than in the chest area. Definitely recommend for someone with a larger bust. I am an A so the neckline doesnâ€™t really flatter me but after some alterations it looks much better. All in all a great dress. Note: I ordered the navy blue and it has a deep purple tone and is shiny, which is fine with me just an FYI.


Got to large of a size at first (medium) ended up sending back and getting a small it was perfect size chart is a little weird if you want it to fit snug but perfect get one size smaller then the chart says


Love the way the dress fit but hate the padding in the breast area. You can see it through the dress. If you have any cellulite of any kind.... trust me it will show. I'm sure if I would have ordered it in the black it would have been fine. I'm 5'11 and wear an 10 and it's the perfect fit not too tight or too big.


I ordered a larger size thinking it was going to run too small and turned out, it was too big. I should have ordered my true to fit size and then I could have had a dress like this that actually fits to wear to my event. It was a nice thick quality material just wished I ordered a smaller size.


I am a little rough around the edges so the right fit around my love handles looks a little awkward but I got a medium, fits so comfortably. Falls in the bust a bit, but overall. Worth the purchase. In the picture it looks like I'm holding a baby, I assure you it's just lunch ğŸ˜‚
