The dress fits nicely but is not long like the picture shows.  I am only 5'1 so if you are taller it will probably be above the knees.  Gives your boobs a nice push up.


The dress on a whole is beautiful  the material is thick,  I gave this review 1 star because  the back of


the dress split open at the function I wore it too ğŸ˜– I had to take a program n hide my backside..  Make it worst the dress was not tight at all the sowing on the back was poor.  ....


Bought XL, I normally wear size 14-16 bra 38DD, this was too big so I exchanged for a Large which fit perfectly.


Beautiful dress! Very stretchy material... so stretchy I could have gone a size smaller... very sturdy zipper elegant enough for a formal occasion but sexy enough for date night... hugs curves wonderfully


Beautiful dress. The zipper is a little tricky however for the price and quality it's definitely worth it. The cut also supported my breast all night :) true to size also, I'm 160 and the medium fit great.


Great dress for the white party I attended. It was a little big at the top because I'm not busty.


Very pretty. Fit perfect didn't wear it until a year after I purchased it. Would definitely purchase again in another color!!


OMG!!!!! THIS DRESSSSSSSS fits like a glove and i got sooooo many compliments. I wore this to a cocktail formal event. Im a size 12/13 170 pounds and 5'5...xl was perfect. TO DATE THIS IS MY FAV AMAZON PURCHASE EVER!


I am in love with this dress. I got it in the pink color. Its so flattering, makes my girls look great and is soft and pretty. For the price, its perfect. I think i will be ordering the darker colors for winter. So excited about this dress.


This "dress" is a joke. I'm not sure what I can do exactly with it. Everything is just wrong. The cut, the fabric and even the zipper.
