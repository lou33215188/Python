LOVED IT SOOOOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS, I WAS TOLD I LOOK VERY CLASSY


The dress can be cute, I ordered a L and it fits well except around my arms, It feels like the off the shoulder part was made for a S/M. The material is comfortable, but definitely wasn't for me.


Great control, you can wear bra less and I'm large busted. Doesn't show lumps or bumps. Totally hot


I love the color. But my zipper didn't work nor zip cup


Beautiful dress, I purchased


Style is pretty, doesn't fit mid section well n Don't like the material looks cheap


Beautiful and stretchy. Order a size down.


This dress fits perfectly and can very quickly. Tad more cleavage than I expected but super sexy.


I'm not too crazy about the fabric, it could of been better quality.


Love this dress fit so beautifully. I got the Large as per reviews. And didn't regret it at all.
