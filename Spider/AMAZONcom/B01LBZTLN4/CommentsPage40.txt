Love my dress! Got a lot of compliments! ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€


Super cute on. Just wish had more support for busty girls. Just going to have to find a good strapless bra.


Its a very sexy dress.  It looks great on.  I did have to shorten it because I'm short.  Got lots of compliments.


Love this dress.  It's made well fits nice, but be a ware it plunges in the front.  I bought a cami to cover my cleavage.


Dress came with a tiny hole with the boning/underwire sticking out. The dress is more satiny than I thought.


It is sexy on..I am 5ft 2in, 160 lbs, and a 38DD..Breast area could be a little roomier.


I've purchased this dress in two different colors. Loved it each time.


Great material, great fit love this dress


Beautiful. ! Wore it to a wedding and got a lot of compliments on it


Ordered the dress for my birthday. I'm a plus size girl. I ordered the 2xl. This dress looked beautiful on me. Cons of the dress is the padding in the bra area is in a horrible spot. ImIf you have big breast the padding looks very weird. Also make sure you wear good slang it emphasizes tummy area. Other than that beautiful dress for the price.
