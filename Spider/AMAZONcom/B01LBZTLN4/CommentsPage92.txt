It is not what i expected


Fits great, I received a lot of compliments on this dress. The top V cut is low


I love this dress, it fit perfectly and very sexy. I got plenty of compliments.


Wonderful dress. Elegant.


Loved this dress but too small. No tag inside to verify the size.


I ordered a size small and it was true to size chart. Great workmanship. Pleasantly surprised!


True fit, looks great and feels great. My only gripe with it is the zipper. It's constantly on the verge of breaking or it rather feels like it is.


Will need some dress tape keep the top from moving lovely sexy dress now to find the perfect shoe


The dress fits large and does fit well on my shoulder


I weigh 145 and 5'6. Fits great. The zipper is not that great!!
