I didn't like the material either


Great quality dress for the price. Zipper was difficult to maneuver. I am usually a size 4, but recently had a baby, so ordered Medium just in case. It fit a little loose on my body (probably could've fit a Small because it's stretchy) but looked fine.


I'm buying two more!!! I'm ordering a L next time.


Very upset. I ordered this dress in black and when I opened the package the dress was purple!!!! Sending back asap!


I loved the dress it fit perfect i wasn't expecting it to look this good on i however didn't like the zipper it kept getting stuck but everything was expected heads up the v is actually a hard piece of plastic that keeps everything in place but it's not bad


Came with one of the wires sticking out of the dress and had to fix it ok quality and will work out for the event. Definitely on cheap side as for material.


This dress is made with nice fabric and sewn well. I received tons of compliments on it.


Nice dress color is it the blue thatâ€™s shown it really dark like blue black.  The fit and fabric is nice I ordered a large it fits great!


This is a great dress. A touch shiny material like a satin which I love. I ordered an XL which was too big so returned for a large. So glad too because the XL was a different material. Not as nice. Super value for the price.
