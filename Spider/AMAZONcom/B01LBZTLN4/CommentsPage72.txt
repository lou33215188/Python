Sexy


The material is a nice quality, it arrived earlier than I expected. Its a great price for a great product.


A bit large in the bust but a little fillers made it fit perfectly!!


Great fabric and really nice - I wish zipper was black it stands out a bit . Dress runs large


Absolutely loved the dress! I will definitely be ordering in a different color. I generally wear 12 or 14 and ordered a large and it fit perfectly. I got plenty of complements.


I love the dress, ordered a 3X,  however its cut small one more size up and it would  have been perfect.  I gave it away as a gift.


Nice


Purchased this for my daughter's graduation. She looked so nice in it. has a lot of stretch in it also.


Love this dress!!! I loved it so much that I have purchased it twice  (white and black). Thick enough material that it can be worn with a body shaper or spanx.


Would have liked a black zipper then a silver one only complaint
