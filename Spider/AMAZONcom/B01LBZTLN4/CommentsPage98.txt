The cut and fit are horrible!


The dress looks great the only problem the zipper is had to zip up


I love the way the dress fits me and ill will be wearing it to my niece wedding thanks.....


This dress fit perfectly it made my valentines day amazing.


the wire in the v is way to large they need to make it smaller ND maybe bendable to fit your body


150lbs 36C Size M fit Perfect!


I am about 160 Ibs, and a 34DD and I got a medium it fits just right!!!


the wire makes it weird... doesn't stay folded on arms... always sliding down


Itâ€™s not as bright as the picture. The straps are ok .... just wasnâ€™t what I thought.


MagnÃ­fico
