Great Dress! Very Stunning! I'm 150 5'3 Medium fits Great! Will reorder in another color ğŸ˜ŠSatisfied Customer


this is so beautiful ! length fit perfectly !!


This fit very well.. I have broad shoulders and this dress managed to not make me look like a linebacker. I wear a 10/12 and ordered a large. Perfect.


Zipper was damaged and once I unzipped it I was unable to zip it back up. Unfortunately I was not able to enjoy this beauty and had to buy at the last minute. However, material was nice, item looked exactly like the picture, arrived in good time just zipper issues.


Beautiful dress i brought a small and im 5"1"145lb i have curves so buy your true size i got a lot of compliments


It's a beautiful dress, I just didn't like the way it hung on me. Will give as a gift.


Wore this for Valentineâ€™s Day. Boyfriend LOVED it. I do really like it, but be warned, it is very booby!


I bought it for my friends graduation haven't used it but I tried it and I love it !!


Not sure I will ever wear this dress, much less give it away. The breast area boning is very uncomfortable and not properly placed. Looks completely different from the picture.


Too long and material is cheap
