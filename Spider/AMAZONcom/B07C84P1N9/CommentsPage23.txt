Very elegant and beautifully simple.  I love this dress. I was worried that the flowery design would be too much but it is quite discreet. The length and style are perfect


Beautiful dress. Very comfortable. I am 5'1 150lbs and the large was snug in all of the right places. Perfect for the evening. It is versatile. 20k wedding to casual night out. Good go to dress!!!


very nice dress, just as pictured. I love the color and the fact that it's not too short (I am 5' 7'')


So flatering, fits perfectly and hides body flaws nicely.  Very soft lace. Fast becoming my go to LBD!


Looks good on.  Not super quality,  but for the price, it washes well.  Not planning to wear it often.


For the price, this was absolutely perfect! I needed a cocktail dress for a cruise. I don't wear much for dresses so I wanted something that would suffice without spending a lot of money. It is modest and sexy at the same time. I love that it is knee length, and the lace isn't too itchy (which I often have problems with)


wow! the reviews weren't kidding. This dress is phenomenal. will be wearing it to a wedding this summer. I tried on all the colors, and ended up in the blue, for something a little different. but the red and black were amazing too. Really hard to choose. I can't get over the price!!!!


i'm 5'8" 160 lbs. and got the large. Thought this might help others decide.


Love the dress! I'm usually a medium, but needed a large so that it wasn't skin tight. There's no zipper, it goes on and off over your head--keeps it seem less, but requires some wiggle room.


The dress is beautiful and looks more expensive than it was!


This dress was surprisingly perfect for a wedding I attended. It was super comfortable and didn't look like a $20 dress.


this dress is awesome exactly how the picture shows great dress for the price
