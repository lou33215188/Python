This dress is wonderful.  I was hesitant to buy since the price was too good to be true, but I am so glad I did because this is a beautiful dress made with nice fabric and very flattering.  I'm 5'8" 137 lbs and the medium fits perfect.  Fabric is soft and a little stretchu, not see through, and the lace looks lovely in person (not cheap looking at all).  Highly recommend and so glad I purchases


Really pretty, well made dress for the price. The color was nice as well. It fit well and was comfortable, but didnâ€™t suit my figure, so I returned it, but itâ€™s definitely a quality product for a price that canâ€™t be beat.


Oh my goodness!


I am in love. I'm a 50 something curvy hour glass & this hugs in all the right places and still remains modest up top. I'm about 160, 5'8" & ordered an XL & it  fit well. There was one spot I needed to tack in some lace on the shoulder (see photo) but for 17 dollars something, who cares? Great product. I'm so happy.


Love this dress! With a cardigan, it works for the office, and without one, it's a great cocktail dress. I love how soft the lace is, and the style is flattering. For reference, I got a large, and it fit me perfectly. I have a large bust (36D) and I wear a 12 in dresses usually.


I love this dress, but at 5'2, it is much too long on me. It's well-made, and for the price, I may keep it and try to have it altered. I did size up; I'm usually a size 6 and I bought a L in this dress. Other than the length, I love the fit.


I just received my dress and I very much love it. The fit is great. With that having been said, I do have to return it due to an unfinished seam in the front. I wanted a dress for a formal event that is in a few days. Hoping to get a replacement in time. If a replacement comes in time, I will write an updated review.


Gorgeous dress. I usually wear M so I got the M and it fits perfectly. I am 5'2 and the lace goes a little longer, just below the knee. I am still thinking whether to leave like that or get it shortened. The navy blue is just amazing. I can wait to wear it.


This dress is beautiful! The fit is lovely. I am 5'8", 160lb and 36C, and the large fit perfectly. The material feels comfortable against the skin and doesn't feel cheap. Will definitely buy more from this vendor!


Amazing dress, while thin itâ€™s not at all see-through. Itâ€™s comfortable, sexy and very classy! Perfect for a work gala or wedding! Iâ€™m 5â€™7â€� and 138lbs and went with the Large. I love it so much!!!


This dress is perfect, ordered in a size medium the first time around and it was a little to large on me. I am 5'7 and around 140 pounds and returned the dress for a small and after that it fit perfectly. The dress sat just above the knee on me and I felt that it was appropriate. I find it difficult to find dresses that are a decent length. So far I've worn this to a wedding but it is professional enough to wear to work. It has enough stretch to it, it's sewn nicely and it not scratchy. Love it and would definitely order it in more colors.
