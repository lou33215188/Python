Nice color!


I felt simply stunning while wearing it! It was a long day and I was comfortable all day.


In love


Great dress for a very inexpensive price.


Beautiful dress!  I love it so much.


Bought it for a wedding and it was perfect


Loved.


Fits perfect


I had to try this given the reviews and the price.  I have no idea how it will hold up after several wearing but the color is a beautiful navy blue and the lace is very delicate looking and very feminine.  I am 5'9" and about 135-140 lbs and normally wear a size 8 and I don't like things tight.  I purchased the large and it is pretty fitting but it does have "give" in it.  Give it a try.  Even if it's for one wearing.....the price is right!


I looked great in it!
