My wife always washes newly purchased cloth before she wears it and thereâ€™s no exception in this case.  Because this dress falls into the delicate category, she washed it by hand.  Afterwards, she air-drys it in the sun.  When itâ€™s dried, she folds it for storage.  Thatâ€™s when she noticed a little damage near the back of left arm area.


This type of damage couldnâ€™t be done during transit, so itâ€™s not a delivery issue.  It also wouldnâ€™t be done due to washing by hand, as my wife wouldâ€™ve notice it right away.


Whatever the cause maybe, the dress is damaged now. Thatâ€™s very disappointing, since she hasnâ€™t had the chance to wear it yet.  It may not seem like a big damage or even a big deal, but that still doesnâ€™t make us feel good about this product.


I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.


Perfecto. When I say I had so many compliments when I wore this to a job function. It fits perfect.y and love the material.

Dress was much better quality than i expected. Can't wait to wear it :)


She loves it and fits like a glove


Perfect fit, I am so excited to wear this.


I love lace material. This dress looks fabolous and the way it feels on me. I could've bought another one but in red color. Great dress, great prize... can't beat that!!!


It looks exactly as the picture. It molds to the body. It looks very elegant.


Wow! This dress is so nice.  I'm very surprised it fits so well. I'm 5'5 and 130lbs. It fits nice in all the right places and it goes a little past my knees. I got a medium.


Update: I washed it with other delicates but the whole neck frayed. I emailed the company and have yet to send another like they said they would. I did love the dress.


This dress is very pretty and fit perfectly I'm 5"6. 118lb size small is perfect!!
