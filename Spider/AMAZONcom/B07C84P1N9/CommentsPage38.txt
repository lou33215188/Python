This dress is really comfortable, and looks stunning! I'm 5'11" 164lbs and the large was a tad big but still looks great! The price was also amazing.


This looks like dress from Macy's!! Just gorgeous!!!


Fell in love with my wife all over again.


love it


Bought this dress as a back up. It fits so great that I'm keeping it! I got an XL and it fits amazing. I'm 5'6 and have wide hips ANd it fit like a glove. I'll post pics as soon as I wear it


material is better than i expected.  very good quality


I don't like dresses to hug my body. The color and the lacy edges looked nice, though.


Its very pretty but a little bit small just have to lose weight and it will be fine


not the blue in pic


Beautiful dress! The quality is absolutely amazing for the price. I'm 5'10 150#, I bought a medium and it fits perfectly! The dress falls right at my knee. Definitly a must have !!
