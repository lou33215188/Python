This dress fit absolutely perfect. Ordering online makes me so nervous but I had an event to attend and nothing to wear. The dress was priced perfectly so I went for it.


I'm about 5'9" and weight about 170 lbs. I have a DD chest and was afraid this wouldn't fit right in that area. Luckily, it fit perfect. The dress fell just above my knee and the sleeves covered about half of the shoulder. I don't have very much of a curvy figure and thankfully the dress didn't make me look like a bottle of ketchup. It fit nicely and the design covered any flaw I might have been worried about. I'd purchase in a different color if needed for another event. Loved the fit and got a ton of compliments on it.


I am going on a cruise and ordered this dress for both formal nights.  This dress is quite formal; it isn't work appropriate but is great for any kind of formal events.  For the price, it is extremely well made.  I wouldn't think by just looking at it that it was so inexpensive.  The only reason I am giving it 4/5 stars rather than the full five is that I went by the size chart and other reviews and the size I ordered fit but was a little loose in the stomach.  If you're very petite like me (under 5 feet tall), order a small if you don't want it to strike your legs mid-shin.


Is identical to the photograph, it is simply lovely adjustable fabric, I measure 5'2 and weight 185 pounds XI order and I stay divine


I love this dress!!  It is beautiful, and fit like a glove.  I could not believe for the price how great well made the dress is.  I will say that I do think this dress will snag easy.  However, I am sure I can get about 10+ wears out of this dress before the snagging will really start to set in.  Its a lacy feel, and its great!


I was worried about the dress size because I have recently lost 50LBS and I am just starting to purchase new clothes for my new body size... but I read the reviews of people with similar bodies, and was able to determine my correct size.  I am 5'3" 140-145 lbs, pant size 8-10, and 36something DD.  I purchased a large and I cannot believe how great I feel in this dress.


I went by the waist measurements on the size chart. It arrived right on time. It looked just like the picture including the color. The blue was very nice!!


 2 things when it arrived.


 1- mine had a hole in seam . On the back side arm/shoulder area.  It was big enough to notice. But small enough to fix. I fixed it.


The material it very strechy. But the lace is very fragile in places that are not lined. Such as the arms/shoulder area.


2. I bought the Large based on recommened size chart. I used the waist measurement to pick out which size. I was worried when it came. The large looked really big. I bought this for my 20 yr old daughter. She is typically a Medium size for most clothing Items. Since this  was a gift. And it was intended to worn for a special occassion or possible wedding. So I wasnt looking for the fit to be hugging all the wrong parts. The Large was perfect in my opinion !!! So glad I went with waist size.


The dress laid very well but still hugged the body. The neck line is really pretty. I would buy this again.


If u are going back and fourth on which size to get. I think it would just depend on your style or Where you might plan on wearing it. Even though the dress looked big...it did not fit big. Because it still hugs and shows off your curves. But it is long. If you are 5'4 or shorter. It will probably have to be hemmed. Its a great length..if you are tall.


i love this dress.  it's a little loose around my midsection, but with a 25" waist that's almost every dress i buy, especially if there's some elasticity like this one has.  i got a decorative elasticized belt to go with it and it was perfect (take a look at the picture) i bought this for a wedding, and i was complimented at every turn


The dress is 3-1/2 stars for the following reasons:


Medium almost too big on my wife 5'11' 135 lbs (according to her) but tight in the armpits.


Ordered same day shipping & received 3 days later


Blue is not blue at all . It is PURPLE.


She wants to keep it & ordering online is really a crap shoot so it's not all bad just some issues to be aware of. If it wasn't a lightning deal and I had paid full price I'd be pissed and have sent it back just on principle, since it's not true to color (not even close to the pic) and it arrived late. Since it wasnt needed in any certain timeframe I was ok with the delay. But blue? C'mon man. That thing is straight up purple. Update - we ordered the red one too - it's orange ğŸ˜‚


Pretty dress HOWEVER, the photo of the blue looks nothing like what arrived. This is for a wedding so I needed it to match a color scheme and the blue in the advertising pic looks blue but dress is purple. Compare the two, nothing alike. I don't even have time to exchange. I'll be the only one in the family not wearing the colors asked of us


This dress is very pretty and fit perfectly! It was longer (knee length) which was perfect and exactly what I was going for. It was snug where it should be but not too tight where it is uncomfortable. Did I mention this is an amazing price for this dress?? All night people kept asking where I got my dress, it was beautiful! Great quality and will wear it many times again. For reference I purchased a size S and am 5'2", 110lbs.


This dress is simply gorgeous! High quality, gorgeous lace, not cheaply made at all! Amazing deal for the price! I'm 5'0" and 115 lbs and got the small. It is perfect!
