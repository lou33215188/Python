Love the dress


Way longer than the picture shows


I love this dress! I am 5'7" and 130lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly! Super quality!


Nice comfortable dress. Worth the price.


Beautiful color, just the right length and I am only 5 feet tall.


not the best material


Awesome dress. Especially for the price !!!


Fits nicely. Nice longer length to it. Get a lot of compliments on it.


Great


Love the design and the color, but it fit me somewhat small,


I wear a size 8 but this feels closer to a 6
