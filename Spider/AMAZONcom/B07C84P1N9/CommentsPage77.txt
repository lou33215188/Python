The material is really soft  but sturdy I love it.


love it!


Beautiful dress.  There is no zipper so it must go over your head which is the only downfall if you have already done your hair.  However for a slip on dress, the fit of the dress holds well.  I had it on and off a couple times trying to decide what to wear and it held up well.  I am only 5'2 and the length was just below my knees.  With heels it looked very attractive.


This was the perfect dress for a cocktail event. Good quality for the money invested!


Super cute and soft..! True American size


Good value for the price.


I really like the dress, I want to wear it more but unfortunately after only one time use, I can see the threads from the laces are falling apart. I really love the dress, but now I fear if I wear the dress again, more threads will come out and dress will be ruined.


Wears beautiful.


I love this dress


Beautiful dress!
