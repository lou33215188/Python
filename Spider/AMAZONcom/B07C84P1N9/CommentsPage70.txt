really like this dress and the price. i bought the navy lace in large, not too clingy which is great.


Great dress for the price. Comfortable and classy.


Great dress! It's a plus that it didn't wrinkle in my suitcase. I wore the dress to a wedding. and loved the way it fit - it was very flattering.
