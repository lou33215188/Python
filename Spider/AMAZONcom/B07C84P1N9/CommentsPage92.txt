This dress was cute, but cheaply made. The lace on top was ripped when I received it.


Terr√≠vel! No god


Ran very small.


Ordered small but its too big for me coz it fit like medium.


Dress comes without a zipper. Too difficult to get on or off.


We have a lot of wedding coming up and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on dresses. I bought this "Stanzino Cocktail Dress | Women's Sleeveless Lace Dresses for Special Occasions" dress in red. I am 5'7 and 135 lbs and I bought a small. The dress fits me nicely. I love the length. I am done with short dresses. This dress is very similar to the dress I got from banana republic, but for quarter of the price. The dress doesn't have a zipper, bud I had no problems putting it on. The lace is very pretty and feminine. This dress will work for every occasion, can definitely be dressed up or down with a pair of boots. The dress is machine washable which is great for me, I do not like spending money at the dry cleaners. The red color is very bright, which is what I was looking for. Shipping was fast and product arrived on time. I will definitely recommend this dress to family and friends.


Ordered black and got red. Medium fit well. I'm 5'2 and 135lbs and it could have been a little more snug for me. I re-ordered the black in a small. Good quality and fell right below my kneee.


A bit small


Too small for the posted size.


A little long for me. Keeps bunching up.
