Really cute dress, I ordered a large and it fit perfect and wasn't short. There was a little of lace hanging but I trimmed it off.. I wore the dress to a wedding and got a lot of compliments.


I wore this dress for a wedding and it was perfect. It feels like a much more expensive dress than what it costs. It's slightly tight fitting, so I wore my spanx underneath, but it's very figure flattering! I wore a cardigan over the top also, so it looks great layered too.  I'm 5'9 and it hit me right above the knee.


great quality.  my wife is 5'5" and dress was knee length, perfect for what she was looking for.


Very happy with my purchase of this dress!! Followed the other reviews for what size to buy and they were correct.  Very pretty dress that is perfect for any occasion and very flattering.  Gave it 4 stars because the slip tends to slide sideways so you need to adjust it back in place but other than that perfect! I just purchased a second dress in a different color!


Fit me perfectly! Iâ€™m glad I decided to go with a medium because the small wouldâ€™ve been too tight on me and I like to have a little â€œwiggleâ€� room in my dresses. But the lace detail is gorgeous.


Very cute, wore all day comfortably. Only issue was with the lace snagging. I had to cut off lose strands all over so I am not expecting it will hold up for very long.


I read all the reviews and I was happy that I purchased this dress! It so pretty! I am normally size 10, 5'3 150lbs. I ordered a large and it fit me perfect.


I am really sad that this dress runs a bit small, since it is well made, soft lace, and gorgeous!  I am normally an X-Large, so that is what I ordered, and the dress is VERY snug.  Very disappointing since it is so pretty!  If they had it in the next size up I would definitely buy it in more colors!


Very nice. I am short but the length was good since I am in my late 50's. I dont want to look like I am trying to be a 20 something.


For once this dress is as expected and fits as described in the photos. The color is a vibrant red and the material is comfortable. Iâ€™m 5,7- 145 lbs- I ordered a L. It fits well, just above my knee.
