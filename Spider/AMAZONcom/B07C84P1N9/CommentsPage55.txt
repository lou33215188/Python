This dress fit my wife perfectly and she love it.


This dress is very nice. I wear size 14 and ordered an xl. It fit perfectly.


So cute! It looks just like the picture. Fits a little large, but for the price, it's a great buy.


Ended up returning this dress.  Not very flattering on me, and  a little too long for me.  Will probably fit others better who like longer lengths.


Great Gift for Anyone!


Absolutely perfect fit and beautiful classy every evening, every event, cocktail dress. Especially for the price. Very comfortable as well.


Bought this for my Mother. Fits just PERFECT!!!!


This dress is very cute and fits great! The length is perfect, it's comfortable and you can't beat the price.


Very pretty dress for a great price!! Absolutely no complaints.


Great dress at great price! I got a small and was able to wear at 24 weeks pregnant. At 5 ft and  115lbs, the length passed my kneecaps but still looks great.
