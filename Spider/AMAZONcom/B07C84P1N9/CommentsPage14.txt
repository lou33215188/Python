Absolutely love this dress! Bought a medium and it fits perfect. I'm 5'4, 145 pounds and a Mom of 2 so I'm always a little leery to buy fitted clothes due to the extra weight around the midsection however this fit really nice. Plus the price was hard to beat!


It's a good true to size dress. I got it in black color size M ( usually I buy size 4/6)which looks really nice! Only thing is that some threads needed to b trimmed. For the price I paid, I shouldn't be complaining!!


I love, love, love this dress!  I ordered it because I couldn't beat the price and figured I could return it if I didn't like it in person.  It fits so well and appears to be a good material.  Now I just need an event to wear it to! :)


Can't beat the price on this dress , & it looks really nice on . I prefer knee length dresses, and at 5'5" this comes perfectly to my knees. It's also very forgiving if you've got curves.  Definitely a great buy!


I rely completely on reviews when I buy clothes on here. This dress is gorgeous. Great quality for a great price.


Cheaply made dress and the threads are already pulling out. Also too tight


I'm a picky shopper and not much of an online shopper but I needed a dress & couldnt afford much. I seen this dress and read majority of the reviews and received mixed feelings about ordering this dress. I took the chance of faith and I received the dress yesterday. The dress is lovely. I'm 5'11 & 160lbs and the dress is perfect. the dress looks so elegant, you can't tell the material is cheap with the color I chose which is navy blue. I love the dress it's great for cocktail parties, weddings & church. The people who complained I really don't understand because it's hard for me to find a dress that compliments my figure for less than $60. I definitely recommend ğŸ™ŒğŸ�½


AMAZING dress! I have a short torso,  so its ever so slightly baggy in my waist area. But aside from that,  it's a perfect fit. I'm 5'6" tall, and 147Lbs, and the Medium fit great. An awesome deal at > $20!


Eureka!!!!  Todays Deal was a BIG DEAL....I am soooooo pleased with this dress.  Beautiful color and nice fit, however, I had to order two sizes up from my normal size.The dress, in my opinion, runs small.


I actually think this dress is fantastic for the price n quality but I may send it back for 2 reasons. The small fits me but is tight under my arms & u can't see it in the pics but the waist is a bit loose (I could fix that though with a good seamstress right?) I guess it's a matter of how much I like this dress. I love that u can just pull it over your head and that it reminds me of Audrey Hepburns Breakfast at Tiffanys! Super sleek dress! If you're not too heavy in your arm area and a little thicker in the waist line, this dress will be very flattering on you! Overall beautiful dress with a style reminiscent of the 1960's ğŸ’œ
