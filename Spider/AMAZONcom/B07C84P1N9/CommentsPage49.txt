I had to get the larger size based on prior customer review. It was fitting when you choose  one size higher. The cut design on shoulders made my arms a bit chubby.


lovely dress...nicely made, fits like a dream!!


not super flattering


Snug in spots but good.


Beautiful dress! I ordered medium based on reviews. I wasn't sure because most ladies didn't mention how it fit in the bust. I am 5ft 7inchesand weigh 140 pounds.i normally wear a size 6. My bust size is 36 D however. The dress fits my body perfectly if you want a form fitting look but is very snug across the chest. I just ordered the large to see if it fits better but afraid it may be too large on rest of my body! Suggest size up for busty ladies! I will re review when large comes. Material is beautiful and length is perfect! My fiancÃ© loved it on me just as it is but I don't want to look like my chest is being squeezed!! This dress looks way more expensive! For the price I paid I will likely just give away the one that doesn't fit the best!!


Excellent


i really liked the feel, style, length of the dress but it was too small, unless u r going for the skin tight look, i wasn't . (im 5'6" and have more of an hour glass figure)


I LOVE this dress!!! It is great quality and fit perfect! I'm 28yo, 5'5 118lbs. 26 waist, 32c bust. I bought a small. It's very sexy!!!


Good quality and pretty one


I love this dress!
