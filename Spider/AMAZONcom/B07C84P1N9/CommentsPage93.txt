Good.


This dress runs very small, hence the 3 stars. The design and look of the dress is gorgeous, but there was no way the XL would fit my bust area. I even looked at the sizing charts and the review. Just not enough give in the lace. So for that reason alone it got the lower rating.


Absolutely stunning dress at a value price. I am 5' 7" and weigh 175lbs and normally wear a size 12. I ordered the XL dress for a bachlorette party and it fits like a glove! It did smell strange when I received it so I washed in washing machine and hung up to dry. I was worried about how it would hold up in the wash, but it was perfect!!


Absolutely love this dress! I am 5"2' and about 125 lbs with a 38D chest and it fit me like a glove (I ordered a small). It was a well made dress and had a beautiful length and neckline. I bought it in red and now I want one in every color. It's a very classy formal event dress!


I got completely a different dress than what was pictured here and in the other customer reviews. There was only lace on the top, not over the entire dress. Not sure what happened - hopefully it doesn't happen to any one else!


This dress is true to size!!! Like all things on Amazon, I went up a size expecting it to be too tight if I ordered my true size, small. The medium is a tad too big for me, but was by no fault of the seller. The quality is incredible and the color is exactly what I was hoping for.I ordered this dress for my wedding rehersal dinner, so I am so incredibly happy that it wasn't some cheap fabric thrown together. Must purchase!


Looks cheap just like the cost
