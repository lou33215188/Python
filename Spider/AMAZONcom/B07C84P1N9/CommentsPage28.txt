Fabric is soft; style is flattering, mature, and still a little sexy. Perfect for a wedding or work party. Lace along edge at bottom and top are slightly different colors than the body of the dress. I ordered the navy and it has a purple tone to it.


Hi, I bought the Large, but I should have purchased the XLarge instead.  It fits me, but it would have been more roomy and comfy with the XL.  I love the shade of red.  I must say it's a beautiful dress. I will be wearing it for Christmas with a light cardigan.  I am 5' 6" and weights 152lbs.


Fits as expected and it is very beautiful


It looks much more expensive than what it was. Fits like a glove and is so classy and elegant. I'll buy this in more colors. (Excuse the pizza over my face, haha)


Beautiful dresss. Fits like a glove and feels amazing! Great price too!


This is a very classy party dress. I like it a lot!


I got a size up (large) the first time because I was worried that it would fit too tight. However the dress was too loose and it looked awkward, plus there was a tear in the dress. So I returned the first one and ordered my usual size (medium) and the dress was perfect! Form fitting without being too revealing, just the right balance between sexy and sophisticated


very lovely dress as described by seller received lots of complement. A very good dress good price excellent quality


Fit as expected and color and dress looks marvelous. I loved it.


Great quality for the price.  Absolutely love it, beautiful color.  It looks really good on.  Paid $60 for a similar dress at Express and I love them both.  I'm 5"4 and a size 6, more stocky than thin and it fits great on me.
